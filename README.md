# Effects of land use and land cover changes on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and carbon storage in Norway: A systematic map and decision support tool.
### Background
Land use and land cover change is widely acknowledged as a main driver of global biodiversity loss and climate change and affects natureâ€™s ability to provide ecosystem services. 
However, we lack systematic overview of knowledge on the topic from Norway. In this project, we systematically synthesize and present knowledge on land change and impacts on Norwegian species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services in the form of a systematic map. We also present a decision support tool, summarizing the results of the study in an online interactive systematic map.
