Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of “adaptive management”, where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway’s Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK – which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.;Norway;10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.063;NA;NA;NA;2018;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In this context, social learning is valuable to inform stakeholders of the efficacy of riparian vegetation in mitigating stream degradation. We aim to develop a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for application as a learning tool to simulate and assess the reach- and segment-scale effects of riparian vegetation properties and land use on instream invertebrates. We surveyed reach-scale riparian conditions, extracted segment-scale riparian and subcatchment land use information from geographic information system data, and collected macroinvertebrate samples from four catchments in Europe (Belgium, Norway, Romania, and Sweden). We modelled the ecological condition based on the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index, a macroinvertebrate-based index widely used in European bioassessment, as a function of different riparian variables using the BBN modelling approach. The results of the model simulations provided insights into the usefulness of riparian vegetation attributes in enhancing the ecological condition, with reach-scale riparian vegetation quality associated with the strongest improvements in ecological status. Specifically, reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 3 (i.e. moderate quality) generally results in the highest probability of a good ASPT score (99–100%). In contrast, a site with a narrow width of riparian trees and a small area of trees with reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 1 (i.e. low quality) predicts a high probability of a bad ASPT score (74%). The strengths of the BBN model are the ease of interpretation, fast simulation, ability to explicitly indicate uncertainty in model outcomes, and interactivity. These merits point to the potential use of the BBN model in workshop activities to stimulate key learning processes that help inform the management of riparian zones. © 2021 The Authors;Catchment management and Forest riparian buffers and Learning environment and Nature-based solution and Restoration and Social learning and Stakeholders engagement and Water resource management and Animals and Bayes Theorem and Ecosystem and Forests and Invertebrates and Rivers and Belgium and Norway and Romania and Sweden and Bayesian networks and Biodiversity and Catchments and Computer aided instruction and Conservation and Ecosystems and Forestry and Information use and Land use and Learning systems and Runoff and Water management and Bayesian belief network models and Forest riparian buffer and Learning environments and Riparian buffers and Riparian vegetation and Stakeholder engagement and Water resources management and Bayesian analysis and buffer zone and catchment and environmental restoration and invertebrate and land use and learning and riparian zone and stakeholder and stream and water management and Article and Average Score Per Taxon index and Bayesian belief network learning and biodiversity and catchment area and data collection method and environmental parameters and geographic distribution and geographic information system and macroinvertebrate and network learning and prediction and process development and riparian ecosystem and simulation and stream (river) and validation process and vegetation and animal and Bayes theorem and ecosystem and forest and river and Vegetation and Buffers;10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152146;00489697 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: M.A.E.

To maintain the biodiversity of hay meadows, it is important to understand local management regimes and the land use history that has shaped them and their biodiversity. There is however a general erosion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), related to hay meadows and other semi-natural habitats. This review aims to examine historical and written sources of land use practices related to hay meadows and to discuss the implications of a reintroduction of TEK in present and future management practices. Traditional land use practices and TEK obtained from written sources from four Norwegian regions and for the country as a whole are compared with present management practices. Written sources show that hay meadows have been managed in a complex but flexible way. Today's management regimes of hay meadows in Norway are streamlined and strongly simplified, most often involving only one late mowing and in some cases grazing. This simplification may result in loss of biodiversity. The potential to include more variety of management practices in hay meadows, by utilizing knowledge from written sources more systematically in combination with farmers' experienced knowledge (TEK) should be better utilized. Such an approach may secure both the biodiversity in hay meadows and TEK for the future. Former and present landscape ecological contexts in the infield-outlying land system show that management should be done for larger landscapes rather than small, isolated hay meadows, to optimize biodiversity conservation. For this study, we conducted a Norwegian literature review, based on ethnographical and ethnobotanical sources, as well as historical and present agricultural statistics, historical maps, results from research projects, and other sources. Our findings are discussed with similar European studies focusing on the historical management of hay meadows.;Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Management practices and Biodiversity and Land use and Semi-natural grassland and History and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE and CENTRAL-EUROPE and GRASSLAND and MANAGEMENT and LANDSCAPE and HISTORY and DIVERSITY and SWEDISH and HETEROGENEITY and Norway and Learning;10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126510;"[""1617-1381"", ""1618-1093     J9  - J NAT CONSERV     JI  - J.

Classification of ecological status and identifying the stressors impacting aquatic habitats is essential for achieving this aim. Here, we evaluate different methods and indices for assessing ecological status in a hydropower-regulated river in central Norway using kick-sampling and macroinvertebrate identification through morphology and DNA as well as using environmental DNA. In Norway, the ASPT index (Average Score Per Taxon) is commonly used to evaluate ecological condition in general, although the index only provides evidence for organic pollution. We observed lower than expected diversity in the regulated river, but this was not reflected in the ASPT index, which showed “Good” to “High” status for all samples and methods. An alternative index, the IBIBI (Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index), returned “Bad” to “Moderate” status using the same data. The DNA-based identification methods returned in general higher species richness and somewhat higher index values than morphological species identification did. Our study exemplifies the importance of including relevant biological quality indices in WFD compliant assessments, and we advocate inclusion of a pressure-independent index like IBIBI in Norwegian river management and DNA-based identification methods for future river management in general. © 2024, The Author(s).;Benthic macroinvertebrates and Community composition and DNA metabarcoding and eDNA and River management;10.1007/s10750-023-05448-4;00188158 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

Land use conflicts are exacerbated under climate policy with wind power plants in reindeer herding areas. Projected developments and climate change impacts challenge the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders and the resilience of reindeer herding. Analysis of biodiversity loss by the GLOBIO3 model is suggested as tool for decision support, in consultation with Sámi reindeer owners, taking into account traditional knowledge of reindeer herding. GLOBIO3 analysis for Sámi reindeer herding land in Finnmark indicates that in 2011, compared to an intact situation, about 50% of the biodiversity of reindeer calving grounds has been lost, and it is expected to be reduced with another 10% in the scenario for 2030. Reindeer owners in Finnmark told that they expect biodiversity loss will have implications for the quality and extent of suitable grazing areas. Especially the quality of the calving grounds is essential for reindeer herding. An important lesson from dialogue with reindeer owners is that even highly impacted areas should not be considered as lost, and thus be opened to further development, as they are still important for seasonal reindeer migration and grazing at certain times of the year. The chapter presents research on methods development, traditional knowledge in the context of Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark and highlights innovative tools to engage rightsholders and stakeholders in the Arctic in development planning processes. © 2023, The Author(s).;GLOBIO3 model and Reindeer herding and Sámi traditional knowledge and Norway;10.1007/978-3-031-17625-8_9;25100475 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: I.

Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km<sup>2</sup> of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km<sup>2</sup>). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km<sup>2</sup>) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs. Using indices of functional connectivity is crucial for environmental impact assessments, as entire ecological networks for several species can be affected far beyond the reservoirs.;NA;10.1007/s13280-022-01824-x;NA;NA;NA;2023;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Rural com- munities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modern- ization will increase the diversity. To probe such diverse and changing at- titudes towards nature, I conducted a qualitative study of young people in a rural community in eastern Norway. Contrary to popular images of such communities as unified against ""pests,"" all typical views of the car- nivore issue were present. Those in favor of the large carnivores were typically middle-class youths with a strong ""outward"" orientation, while those who wanted to shoot the predators were mostly working-class boys with strong ties to the local hunting culture. This pattern was interpreted as a conflict between dominant and subordinate forms of knowledge, and between abstraction-oriented and production-oriented cultural forms. Aside from the growth of the pro-carnivore middle-class seg- ments, the most significant effect of modernization appeared to be the removal of many young people from the subject matter of the conflict. A ""subculturalization"" of the working-class hunting culture also could be discerned, however. After decades of protection, the four species of large carnivores found in mainland Norway (brown bear, lynx, wolverine, and wolf) are now slowly recovering from the brink of extinction. This development is applauded by environmentalists, managers, biolo- gists, and many politicians. Opinion polls also indicate enthusiasm in a majority of the general population. Increasing carnivore populations have spurred fierce conflicts, however. Livestock depredation and competition for huntable game are key issues, but the killing of hunting dogs and the possibility of attacks on people also feature in the controversies. In the public debate it is often suggested that this is a conflict representing a clash between old and new perspectives on nature, or rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Whereas this seems to touch some core issues, we know little about the operative mechanisms. In particular, we know little of how young people are handling such issues.

It focuses on nature conservation, which is vital both to maintain nature's ability to store carbon and to preserve ecosystems, as key aspects of the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The paper analyses the perceptions of local, regional and state stakeholders relating to four rural municipalities following diverging land-use trajectories. We find land policy in all four cases to be highly entangled with strategies to achieve growth in terms of income, job creation and population. When nature conservation was not in line with wider economic or social considerations, it was less integrated into land-policy practices. In three of the municipalities, the construction of residential units, holiday-homes or renewable energy parks was prioritized over the preservation of nature areas or cultural landscapes. One case presented a contrasting trajectory, as it involved a clear alignment between nature conservation and economic growth. Here, conservation was considered a key strategy to both sustain the traditional fishery industry and to accommodate the growing tourism. However, while this municipality's restrictive land use was based on a nature conservation understanding, it was also connected to the greenhouse-gas emissions, resource exhaustion and waste generation traditionally associated with international tourism. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of rural municipalities being equipped with sufficient resources if they are to prioritize environmental concerns over the economic and social dimensions of sustainability in their land-use management practices.;Rural land use and Nature conservation and land use and Sustainable land use and Multilevel cooperation and Social economic and environmental & nbsp and sustainability and GOVERNANCE and Norway;10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103066;"[""0743-0167"", ""1873-1392     J9  - J RURAL STUD     JI  - J.

Representing dominant culture and hegemonic knowledge, managers and scientists have a hard time establishing rapport with anticarnivore hardliners.

Indigenous relations to nature are, however, based on unity between use and protection, implying that human use is necessary for effective protection. Often protected areas include the homelands of Indigenous peoples, whose needs and rights are still being ignored to a large extent. This paper explores the effects of a plan for a significant increase of large nature protection areas in Norway, still under implementation. Most of the new protection areas are in the heartland of the Indigenous Sami, whose core livelihood is reindeer management. The plan implies transfer of jurisdiction from Indigenous and local domains to formalised central domains. In several cases, this has provoked Indigenous and rural groups to organised resistance. In this case study, there are signs of new tensions between Sami and other rural groups. Indigenous land use can be marginalised by park restrictions and increasing pressure from visitor activity. The Sami response was to boycott the park management board leading to a stalemate.

Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sami), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives.

The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found. It is concluded that to ensure successful conservation of the biodiversity of these and other such forests, former land use practices should be documented, and management schemes should be developed on the basis of the acquired knowledge.;biological diversity and boreal forest and conservation and land use history and management and HISTORY and TRANSFORMATION and DIVERSITY and CLIMATE and REGION and Norway and Trees;10.1080/00291951.2012.760002     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"[""0029-1951"", ""1502-5292     J9  - NORSK GEOGR TIDSSKR     JI  - Norsk.

This study aimed to assess to what extent forests are currently protected and how felling restrictions affect the potential annual wood supply within 27 European Union member states, Norway, and Switzerland and to discuss trade-offs between intensified use of forest biomass and forest protection efforts. Protected forests covered 33 million ha (20 % of total forest area) in 2005, of which 16 million ha was protected for biodiversity and the remaining area for landscape diversity. Within the protected areas, on average 48 % of the volume cannot be harvested in forests protected for biodiversity and 40 % in forests protected for landscapes. Consequently, 73 million m(3) (10 % of the annual theoretical potential supply from the total forest area) of wood cannot be felled from the protected forests in Europe. Protected forests do not necessarily affect wood supply given the current demand for wood in Europe. However, if demand for wood from European forests for material and energy use significantly increases, the impact of existing protected forest networks may become significant after all. On the other hand, wood harvesting is allowed to a fair extent in many protected areas. Hence, the question could be raised whether biodiversity and landscape diversity within designated areas are sufficiently protected. Careful planning is required to accommodate both the protection of biological and landscape diversity and demand for wood, while not forgetting all other services that forests provide.;Biodiversity and Bio-energy and Forest protection and Trade-offs and Wood supply and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and ECONOMIC-IMPACTS and BIOMASS and TIMBER and MANAGEMENT and INDICATORS and ENERGY and SECTOR and POLICY and AREAS and Europe;10.1007/s00267-014-0265-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""0364-152X"", ""1432-1009     J9  - ENVIRON MANAGE     JI  - Environ.

For each BES measure, we also identified the BES issues being addressed (e.g., climate regulation, soil maintenance, cultural values); company motivation (i.e., compliance, strategic, profit-seeking); the stakeholders/beneficiaries involved (e.g., employees, forest owners, experts, local communities, public administration, NGOs); and the private governance instruments used for implementing the measure (i.e., regulatory, economic, information and rights-based instruments). The findings suggest that practices such as monetary valuation, biodiversity offsets and green bonds are emerging as profitable or strategically interesting options for Nordic forest companies. However, well-established practices, such as forest inventory, partner auditing and land sparing, continue to be the backbone of private BES governance among the leading companies examined. Although not directly motivated by compliance, private governance measures are largely nested in legislation. The contribution of this study includes reflections of relevance for both the scholarly and managerial realms. From a scholarly perspective, we further elaborate an understanding of BES management and governance from an organizational perspective. From a managerial perspective, we provide and discuss an overview of potential measures that forest companies can implement to address biodiversity and other socio-ecological issues at the land-use level.

The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesteralen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesteralen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.;AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES and GEESE BRANTA-LEUCOPSIS and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BARNACLE GEESE and SNOW GEESE and LAND-USE and HABITAT USE and CONSEQUENCES and CONSERVATION and Norway;10.1371/journal.pone.0071912     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);1932-6203     J9  - PLOS ONE     JI  - PLoS One;8;"Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Matthew""=>""Included""}";2013;20;NA;NA;NA;" {""Matthew""=>""Included""}";NA;NA;NA

In this context, the ecosystem services (ES) framework has been widely adopted for identifying and assessing the values at stake, yet the concept ignores benefits from water and land use functions as important contributions for societal welfare. This paper aims to contribute knowledge for improved benefit assessments in human-modified landscapes, exemplified by watersheds regulated for the production of hydropower. Through a case study approach in two regulated watersheds in Norway, beneficiaries' perceptions of the benefits associated with key watershed activities, i.e., hydropower production, kayaking, angling, and hiking, are presented. Considering the beneficiaries' perspectives, we discuss the relative ability of economic, quantitative, and qualitative assessment methods to present benefits. The study shows that benefit assessments must be carried out on different scales of governance, as benefits are context and scale dependent. We argue for an approach which considers a balance of benefits obtained from ecosystem services, and from water and land use functions within ecological limits. The suitability of the ES framework for guiding benefit assessments in a human-modified landscape and its complementarity with the sustainability concept for informing local-level decision-making are discussed.;ecosystem services and benefit assessments and beneficiaries and regulated watercourses and sustainability dimensions and hydropower and VALUES and VALUATION and SCALE and Humanities and Humanism and Humans;10.3390/su11061821     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);2071-1050     J9  - SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL     JI  - Sustainability;3;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  66;2019;26;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Norway is currently making a significant move to establish a new management model based on national reindeer regions and regional management plans. A focus on wild reindeer as a flagship species allows the species to be included as a broad conservation objective in complex land-use plans. The authors surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Rondane and Setesdal regions to examine their perceptions of the current status of reindeer and how management relates to other social and development issues. Local actors and institutions, including hunters, were perceived as more responsible and suited to make decisions about reindeer population sizes and management objectives than non-local actors. There was little local consensus on the role of human impacts on wild reindeer, and residents rated local knowledge higher than scientific knowledge for management purposes.

Reindeer nomadic husbandry is a coupled social-ecological system that sustains resilience by interacting with the animals and environment: either the herders adjust their actions to animal behavior or change this behavior in ways that suit the herd and pastures. Stressors and shocks affecting Sámi reindeer husbandry are, for instance, sudden warm air temperatures with subsequent snow melting and freezing in winter, bad grazing conditions, loss of grazing lands, and even socio-economic reforms. All these are sudden, unprepared, or forced changes. Climate change resilience includes using reindeer herders’ Indigenous knowledge of selective breeding by maintaining different phenotypes of reindeer such as non-productive and castrated animals in the herd. Nevertheless, in Sámi reindeer husbandry in Norway today, low numbers of male reindeer and the absence of castrated animals challenge the herders’ resilience coping strategies. This chapter discusses factors that constrain resilience in herding societies, contribute to the transformation of reindeer husbandry and the erosion of resilience in the herding society. © The Author(s) 2024.;Reindeer husbandry and Social-ecological resilience and Tipping points in reindeer husbandry and Thinking;10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8;25100475 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

In Mid-Norway, farmers scare spring-staging pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus off their land to protect crops, and this has had clear effects on goose distribution. To protect the geese, Norwegian authorities have implemented economic compensation to farmers to discourage scaring, but this has not been prioritised to accommodate the biological requirements and dispersal patterns of the geese, though such an approach is clearly needed. To address this need, we assessed the negative effects of scaring geese during 2004-2007, and built a species distribution model to identify sites suitable for goose foraging. We subsequently combined known foraging sites with sites identified by our model and prioritised these sites according to their connectivity, perimeter area ratio, years of historic use and proximity to roost. By combining historic data on foraging sites, a species distribution model, and a simple, accountable site selection process we demonstrate how the current compensation scheme can be made 10 times more efficient through strategic prioritisation. Our approach has direct implications for alleviating similar goose-agriculture conflicts throughout Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno.

Species conservation targets require policy support measures that can be applied to a diversity of taxonomic groups, that link action targets to outcome goals, and that can be applied to both global and national data sets to account for national context, which the species threat abatement and restoration (STAR) metric does. To test the flexibility of STAR, we applied the metric to vascular plants listed on national red lists of Brazil, Norway, and South Africa. The STAR metric uses data on species' extinction risk, distributions, and threats, which we obtained from national red lists to quantify the contribution that threat abatement and habitat restoration activities could make to reducing species' extinction risk. Across all 3 countries, the greatest opportunity for reducing plant species' extinction risk was from abating threats from agricultural activities, which could reduce species' extinction risk by 54% in Norway, 36% in South Africa, and 29% in Brazil. Species extinction risk could be reduced by a further 21% in South Africa by abating threats from invasive species and by 21% in Brazil by abating threats from urban expansion. Even with different approaches to red-listing among countries, the STAR metric yielded informative results that identified where the greatest conservation gains could be made for species through threat-abatement and restoration activities. Quantifiably linking local taxonomic coverage and data collection to global processes with STAR would allow national target setting to align with global targets and enable state and nonstate actors to measure and report on their potential contributions to species conservation.;habitat restoration and national red lists and species' extinction risk and threat reduction and threatened species and vascular plants and EXTINCTION RISK and CONSERVATION and BIODIVERSITY;10.1111/cobi.14046;"[""0888-8892"", ""1523-1739     J9  - CONSERV BIOL     JI  - Conserv.

Because the land area available for tree planting may serve multiple purposes, striking the right balance between climate goals and other objectives is crucial. We conducted a survey of the Norwegian population to investigate potential land-use conflicts that may arise from executing a large-scale afforestation programme. Respondents were presented with three land-use alternatives to replace formerly grazed agricultural land. We used manipulated landscape photos to elicit their underlying value orientations. We combined multiple correspondence analysis with latent class regression models to reveal preference heterogeneity. Our models grouped respondents into three latent classes, with 24%, 24% and 52%, respectively, expressing a preference for forest carbon sequestration, recreation or agriculture as the most crucial land-use function to be retained. Birth year emerged as a strong predictor of class membership. Specifically, generations born before 1970 were more inclined to support the continuation of agricultural landscapes, while those born in 1980 and later showed a stronger inclination towards natural forest succession for carbon sequestration or recreational purposes. Quantitatively, every 10-year reduction in age increased the odds of a respondent belonging to the forestation or recreation class (relative to the agricultural class) by a factor of 2. Interestingly, even among respondents who were classified as most climate concerned, natural forests were 50% more likely to be preferred over monoculture spruce plantation as a policy option. This suggests that there may be public resistance to spruce planting for climate mitigation purposes in Norway. © 2023, The Author(s).;Carbon sequestration and Finite-mixture model and Land-use preferences and Latent class regression and Multiple correspondence analysis and Public perception and Norway and Carbon and Climate change and Reforestation and Regression analysis and Agricultural landscapes and Finite mixture modeling and Forest carbon sequestration and Land-use preference and Latent class and Natural forests and afforestation and age structure and carbon sequestration and climate change and correspondence analysis and forest cover and mitigation and monoculture and plantation and reforestation and succession and tree planting and Land use and Trees;10.1007/s10584-023-03588-z;01650009 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: X.

Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference - between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this. 2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty. 3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density. 4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, -including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programmes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.;NA;10.1111/1365-2664.12992;"[""0021-8901"", ""1365-2664""]";3;NA;2018;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked}the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.;Carbon cycle and Climate change and Ecosystem effects and Feedback and Flood events and Norway and carbon cycle and carbon sequestration and climate change and ecosystem service and environmental effect and flood and global climate and landscape ecology and sustainability and Buffers;10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0059.1;19488327 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: D.O.

Due to continuous decline in eider populations in the island of Tautra off the Norwegian west coast from the late 1970s and onwards a number of conservation measures were implemented here to halt this development and the results are yet to be seen. This paper presents the conservation of declining eider populations in Tautra as a case study of conservation challenges in agricultural landscapes, and illustrates the complex interconnections of human use of biological resources and habitat shaping within the context of a subsistence agroecosystem. It contributes new data and perspectives on the challenge to conserve dimensions of biological diversity that have been shaped and developed within previous and lost agroecosystems and economic contexts. The current paper shows the hazard of focussing conservation measures on only one dimension of biodiversity without incorporating other dimensions like the human management of other habitats which had important functions for the development of habitats for the target biodiversity component in the pre-industrial agroecosystem. Successful biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes demands involvement of the historical aspect of resource use to understand the ecological dynamics of habitats and populations. Further, since the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of one habitat are interrelated to other habitats, it is necessary to include the landscape mosaic with different habitats in the conservation efforts and programmes.

The preferences of the local public are increasingly assessed and involved in the planning of mitigation measures for impacted rivers. Aesthetic assessment methods using a common user perspective, i.e., an “on-the-ground” perspective, could potentially be improved by using an aerial perspective facilitated by modern drone technology. Studies on the compatibility of these two perspectives of assessment in terms of public preference elicitation are lacking so far. In river Nea, Norway, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the visual preferences of the local public for different environmental mitigation measures related to weirs, minimum flow, and recreational infrastructure using both perspectives. The results indicate that there exist significant differences in the preferences for scenarios based on the two different visual perspectives, and that a compatibility between them cannot be assumed and therefore requires further investigation. Finally, based on our study setup and previous experience, we outline and propose a standardized procedure for the visualization of mitigation measures as an input to environmental design projects where public perception is incorporated;Aesthetic value and Hydropower production and Mitigation measures and Photo‐based questionnaire and Norway and Antennas and Hydroelectric power and Hydroelectric power plants and Energy productions and Environmental mitigation and Hydro power production and Impact on the environment and Sources of energy and View locations and assessment method and environmental planning and hydroelectric power and infrastructure planning and mitigation and perception and visual analysis and Rivers;10.3390/w13212985;20734441 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

This may affect the future development potential in the wood using sectors in Europe and their contribution in the new circular bio-economy. We explore the potential consequences mainly on the forest sector in the region consisting of EU and Norway (EU + N), but also globally, that would arise if the countries in the EU + N constrained economic utilization of their forest resources. For the analysis, we use the global forest sector model EFI-GTM, which also incorporates the trade in wood and wood products. Due to the globally growing demand for forest products and available forest resources in the rest of the world (RoW) outside of the EU + N, the leakages of harvests, forest industry production and employment opportunities from EU + N to RoW would be considerable. Decreased wood harvests and forest industry production in the EU + N would raise the wood and forest industry product prices globally, and increase production and employment in the forest sector in RoW. Due to the harvest leakage, climate mitigation benefits of the policy in the form of forest carbon sinks in the EU + N would be considerably reduced. Also, there would be inter-sectoral carbon leakage, as part of the wood consumption would shift to more energy-demanding competing materials.;Forest sector and Harvest leakage and Carbon sink and Climate policy and Modelling and LEAKAGE and INDUSTRY and BIOMASS and Trees;10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""1389-9341"", ""1872-7050     J9  - FOREST POLICY ECON     JI  - Forest Policy Econ.""]";7;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  35;2018;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This paper applies implementation theory to explain the different results. First, there is a striking difference in the leadership of the two governments and the way they organized for the planning. The Norwegian government led the process in a top-down manner and tried to apply a ""whole-of-government"" approach. The Canadian government delegated the entire task to the regional branches of one ministry alone. The different roles taken may be explained by different political and economic contexts that create different motivations for the governments to engage. Second, there were different ways of deciding when conflicts arose. The Norwegian coalition government negotiated internal compromises in the form of package deals. In Canada, the collaborative planning based on consensus concealed disagreements in high-level statements and pushed concrete solutions forward to later action planning that never occurred. These processes reflect different national policy styles and resulted in policy designs that created a very different impetus for implementation.

In both cases I quantified timber production as a measure of land acquisition cost and use the ratio between the species richness and timber production as a measure of conservation cost-efficiency. I found a positive correlation between timber production and local species richness of birds as well as beetles, indicating that the forests most valuable for forestry are also the ones most valuable for biodiversity conservation. I used different selection procedures for combining sites in a reverse network to find the minimum set of sites that included all vulnerable species. The minimum set of sites for birds was 30% spruce forest, 30% pine forest, and 40% broad-leaved forest (the three main forest types). The minimum set of sites for the beetles was uniformly distributed along the altitudinal gradient. Both minimum sets were mot cost-efficient for species conservation. I suggest that equal coverage of different productivity classes is more efficient for optimizing biodiversity conservation than over-representing low productivity sites. Less than 1% of Norwegian boreal forests have been protected as nature reserves. The reserve network is fairly representative with respect to altitude, but it is seriously skewed toward low productivity sites. The current network is suboptimal with respect to forest type representativeness, species protection, and cost-efficiency. This is a result of an inefficient strategy of selecting reserve sites and an unfortunate combination of selection criteria.

Sample plots from the National Forest Inventory, covering the entire productive forest area in Norway, were aggregated into 10000 treatment units. Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas. With a real rate of discount of 2.5%, and all the constraints imposed simultaneously, the annual harvest potential was reduced by 30% for the first 10-year period, while the net present value was reduced by 21.5%. The results further demonstrated significant efficiency gains of letting the preservation of old forest be allocated cost-efficiently, compared with a strategy of setting aside an equal portion oil all eligible areas.

Karst.) stand in order to evaluate the effect of thinning regime on C sequestration. At 22 years old, the stand was reduced from 3190 to 2070, 1100 and 820 trees per hectare in four replicates. The N2070 treatment represents the recommended start density in practical forestry, while the other represent a moderate to large reduction in tree number at the present stand age. Aboveground biomass was estimated from single tree measurements of diameter and height based on allometric functions. Litter fall was collected during one and a half years and soil respiration was measured on five occasions during one summer. Ground vegetation was mapped and sampled for biomass, C and N determination. A significant decrease in aboveground tree (including stump-root system) C storage of 27% and 22% due to thinning was found in the N820 and N1100 treatments, respectively, compared to the N2070 treatment. Ground vegetation C storage was little affected by treatment, while litter fall C showed a non-significant decrease in the N820 and N1100 treatments compared to the N2070 treatment. Soil respiration was significantly lower in parts of the summer in the N2070 treatment compared to the N820 treatment. The reason for this is still unexplained since no differences in soil temperature, soil moisture or litter fall chemistry was found between the treatments. No significant treatment effects on humus and mineral soil C storage could be detected. With the present soil variability, the time period of 32 years is probably too short to detect soil C differences due to thinning. The N storage followed the same pattern as for C.

The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.;Alces alces and bioeconomics and Canis lupus and harvesting and migration and moose and sustainable development and wolf and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and SEASONAL MIGRATION and FOREST DAMAGE and BODY-MASS and MORTALITY and PATTERNS and AGE and DYNAMICS and DENSITY and SENESCENCE;10.2981/06-084     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""0909-6396"", ""1903-220X     J9  - WILDLIFE BIOL     JI  - Wildlife Biol.""]";3;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  60;2009;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smola ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site.

We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

Policy reform, market trends and changes to the way citizens and consumers think about the countryside all suggest a need for thinking strategically about the future development of these areas. However, without a broad involvement of stakeholders, land use conflicts, and social and cultural conflicts in general, may increase. Involving stakeholders in upland areas can be facilitated by using scenario technique and by discussing alternative futures in local stakeholder panels. In this paper we present four scenarios of land-use change for the year 2030, and their assessments by stakeholder panels in Scotland, France, Norway, Switzerland, Slovakia and Greece. The aim of the paper is to explore the ways in which stakeholders in these locations advocate and assess these scenarios. We also explore how stakeholders in different countries weight the visual landscape impacts, the livelihood and biodiversity aspects of the scenarios in their assessment, and the reasons for their prioritising. The cross-country analysis shows that stakeholders across the study areas are united in their overall rejection of agricultural liberalisation, advocating a production-oriented, but multifunctional and environmentally-friendly agriculture that maintains landscapes and biodiversity.

In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Flows of supplied ecosystem services depend on a broad range of factors, including climate, hydrology, land management and human population density. The aims of this study were: 1) to quantify the total economic value (TEV) of consumed ecosystem services across Nordic catchments, 2) to explain variation in ecosystem service value using socio-geographic and natural factors as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression, and 3) to determine which societal groups benefit from these ecosystem services. Furthermore, we tested the scientific rigour of our framework based on the concept of final ecosystem services (FES). We used a spatially explicit, integrative framework for ecosystem services quantification to compile data on final ecosystem services provision from six catchments across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Our estimates showed a broad variation in TEV and in the proportion contributed by separate services, with the highest TEV of €7,199 ± 4,561 ha-1 y-1 (mean ± standard deviation) in the Norwegian Orrevassdraget catchment, and the lowest TEV of €183 ± 517 ha-1 y-1 in the Finnish Simojoki catchment. The value of material services was dependent on both geographic factors and land management practices, while the value of immaterial services was strongly dependent on population density and the availability of water. Using spatial data on land use, forest productivity and population density in a GIS analysis showed where hotspots of ecosystem services supply are located, and where specific stakeholder groups benefit most. We show that our framework is applicable to a broad variety of data sources and across countries, making international comparative analyses possible. © 2021 Immerzeel et al.

Increasing concern over the environmental impact of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes. These schemes compensate farmers financially for any loss of income associated with measures that aim to benefit the environment or biodiversity. There are currently agri-environment schemes in 26 out of 44 European countries. 2. Agri-environment schemes vary markedly between countries even within the European Union. The main objectives include reducing nutrient and pesticide emissions, protecting biodiversity, restoring landscapes and preventing rural depopulation. In virtually all countries the uptake of schemes is highest in areas of extensive agriculture where biodiversity is still relatively high and lowest in intensively farmed areas where biodiversity is low. 3. Approximately $ 24·3 billion has been spent on agri-environment schemes in the European Union (EU) since 1994, an unknown proportion of it on schemes with biodiversity conservation aims. We carried out a comprehensive search for studies that test the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in published papers or reports. Only 62 evaluation studies were found originating from just five EU countries and Switzerland (5). Indeed 76% of the studies were from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where until now only c . 6% of the EU agri-environmental budget has been spent. Other studies were from Germany (6), Ireland (3) and Portugal (1). 4. In the majority of studies, the research design was inadequate to assess reliably the effectiveness of the schemes. Thirty-one percent did not contain a statistical analysis. Where an experimental approach was used, designs were usually weak and biased towards giving a favourable result. The commonest experimental design (37% of the studies) was a comparison of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes and control areas. However, there is a risk of bias if either farmers or scheme co-ordinators select the sites for agri-environment schemes. In such cases the sites are likely to have a higher biodiversity at the outset compared to the controls. This problem may be addressed by collecting baseline data (34% of studies), comparing trends (32%) or changes (26%) in biodiversity between areas with and without schemes or by pairing scheme and control sites that experience similar environmental conditions (16%). 5. Overall, 54% of the examined species (groups) demonstrated increases and 6% decreases in species richness or abundance compared with controls. Seventeen percent showed increases for some species and decreases for other species, while 23% showed no change at all in response to agri-environment schemes. The response varied between taxa. Of 19 studies examining the response of birds that included a statistical analysis, four showed significant increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and nine showed both increases and decreases. Comparative figures for 20 arthropod studies yielded 11 studies that showed an increase in species richness or abundance, no study showed a decrease and three showed both increases and;NA;10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00868.x;NA;NA;NA;2003;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Complete, full-coverage vegetation surveys are often used for this purpose, but these are expensive undertakings. We have presented a method to downscale information from regional sampling surveys by poststratification using a land cover map derived from satellite-based measures of reflectance values. This approach opens new prospects for landscape-level evaluation of productivity. We applied this method to eight grazing districts (19-245 km(2)) in Setesdal Vesthei, Norway, in 2006. Sheep densities in three of eight grazing districts of Setesdal Vesthei fluctuated above the estimated grazing capacity. We fitted 43 sheep with Global Positioning System collars in two contrasting grazing districts in 2007-2008 to assess their selection of the land cover productivity classes in the map used for poststratification. In the area with high vegetation coverage, sheep selection increased in areas with an overall higher productivity, supporting the main basis of the approach. However, in the grazing districts with lower vegetation coverage, selection was higher for areas of overall low vegetation productivity. The likely explanation is the presence of small areas of snow bed vegetation with high-quality forage in areas with a generally rocky surface. Our study provides a first step toward a grazing capacity evaluation to achieve a sustainable management of sheep on alpine ranges of Scandinavia, and our approach is likely applicable to other open alpine ranges in the northern hemisphere.;Global Positioning System and habitat selection and land cover and poststratification and resource selection functions and rangeland management and SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION and LAND-COVER and LARGE HERBIVORE and HABITAT SELECTION and ANIMAL HUSBANDRY and HILL VEGETATION and DENSITY and LIVESTOCK and MODEL and THRESHOLDS and Sheep;10.2111/REM-D-12-00177.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""1550-7424"", ""1551-5028     J9  - RANGELAND ECOL MANAG     JI  - Rangel.

As part of the adaptive management procedures, adjustment to harvest is made annually subject to population status. This has required streamlining of monitoring and assessment activities.

As a consequence, much focus has been placed on the engineering of structural flood mitigation measures in rivers. Traditional flood protection measures, such as levees and dredging of the river channel, threaten floodplains and river ecosystems, but during the last decade, sustainable reconciliation of freshwater ecosystems has increased. However, we still find many areas where these traditional measures are proposed, and it is challenging to find tools for evaluation of different measures and quantification of the possible impacts. In this paper, we focus on the river Lærdal in Norway to (i) present the dilemma between traditional flood measures and maintaining river ecosystems and (ii) quantify the efficiency and impact of different solutions based on 2D hydraulic models, remote sensing data, economics, and landscape metrics. Our results show that flood measures may be in serious conflict with environmental protection and legislation to preserve biodiversity and key nature types. © 2021 by the authors.;Dredging and Ecosystem and EIA and Fish and Flood and Floodplains and HEC-RAS and Hydraulic modeling and Impact and Management and Mitigation and Protection and River and Wall confinements and Norway and Biodiversity and Climate change and Disasters and Economics and Flood control and Floods and Hydraulic models and Land use and Remote sensing and Rivers and Flood mitigation measures and Flood protection and Freshwater ecosystem and Landscape metrics and Natural disasters and Remote sensing data and River channels and River ecosystem and biodiversity and climate change and dredging and environmental protection and flood and flood control and remote sensing and river system and Ecosystems and Case-Control Studies;10.3390/w13141884;20734441 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: A.

Concerns over anthropogenic and natural drivers have led to change in the management regime from a population-based model to an area-based model. More complex management goals, increasing involvement of stakeholders, and larger management units call for improved knowledge about reindeer-related values. We examined the responses of 1000 respondents to 39 statements of attitudes and values associated with wild reindeer presence and the management situation in two reindeer regions of southern Norway. We used a partial least-squares path modeling approach to examine the nexus between the attraction of wild reindeer, sustainability concerns, utilitarian and non-utilitarian values, conflicts, and attitudes toward hunting. The results show that local concepts of the sustainability of reindeer are based on opinions about the ecological requirements as well as the roles reindeer can play in the social and economic development of the communities. The attraction of reindeer is a function of consumptive as well as non-consumptive objectives. Segments of the community with different consumptive orientations can share ideas about the attraction of reindeer, but diverge in their interpretation of the sustainability of the species. Improved knowledge about the diversity and complexity of value orientations associated with wild reindeer can be a useful tool for developing multi-objective management frameworks with a diversity of stakeholders who may share similar values and interests, although they have different experience and knowledge bases.;wild reindeer and Norway and management and values and community development and ENVIRONMENTAL PARADIGM SCALE and NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT and VALUE ORIENTATIONS and INFRASTRUCTURE and FORESTRY and CARIBOU and MODELS and Social Values;10.14430/arctic4647     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"[""0004-0843"", ""1923-1245     J9  - ARCTIC     JI  - Arctic""]";6;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  65;2017;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

In Norway, family forest owners own 80% of productive forestland and play a central role in the management of the country's forests. Yet little is known about whether these landowners would be interested in increasing carbon sequestration on their land and selling carbon credits. Only a handful of studies have examined the factors that motivate family forest owners to participate in carbon offset programs, and all of these studies have been conducted in the United States. This study addresses this information gap using data from a mail survey of 1500 Norwegian family forest owners. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the effect of various carbon program, forestland, and landowner characteristics on participation in a hypothetical carbon offset program. Results suggest that there is a considerable amount of interest among Norwegian family forest owners and that the most important predictors of participation are payment amount offered, perceived barriers posed by management actions, importance placed on non-market forest amenities, and attitudes towards climate change.

The quality of recreational opportunities in forested lands is largely dictated by the degree of human influence on the landscape, including forestry, recreational facilities, infrastructure and other man-made constructions. We present a four-part conceptual model based on the recreation opportunity spectrum framework, and tested it by using survey data and automatic counters in urban forests of Oslomarka in Norway. We find empirical support for the four-part planning concept. The pragmatic model may inspire forest landowners, land managers and planners to envision potential contributions to recreational opportunities by identifying four broad categories of suitability for recreational activities labelled: general consideration-, special consideration-, service- and wilderness areas. The conceptual framework can be used as a tool to plan and manage for recreational opportunities at different spatial scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study we present a situation where local goose hunting arrangements respond to objectives in an international management plan for pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) and a local wish to reduce goose numbers as means to reduce grazing damage on farmland. A unique ten-year dataset provides an evaluation of the efficiency of voluntary actions at a local scale for implementing a policy of population control of geese, and general lessons are drawn for collaboration and co-production of knowledge for adaptive management. The study demonstrates how both the hunters and geese adapt in a situation where increasing the harvest of geese is the main objective. Introducing hunting-free days and safe foraging areas significantly increased goose numbers in the study area, with a corresponding increase in hunting success in terms of number of harvested geese. The geese's behavioural response to hunting also triggered the hunters to adapt accordingly by optimal timing and placement in the landscape. Based on the results of the present study we suggest a framework for local implementation of management actions. Bringing end-users on board, facilitates processes and strengthens the achievements, as they represent the actors where implementation occurs. Specifically, our findings demonstrate how optimal goose hunting can be practiced by the use of an adaptive framework with active stakeholder participation.;NA;10.1007/s13280-021-01590-2;NA;NA;NA;2021;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

The philosophy behind the concept is basically the same in all of the countries: to conserve the biodiversity of production landscapes by preserving small habitat patches that are supposed to be particularly valuable. This article reviews the definitions, inventories and implementation processes of WKHs in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Sweden and the Baltic countries have similar WKH models, while the models in Finland and Norway are clearly deviating. Depending on the country, the definitions emphasize different factors, such as soil and bedrock properties, stand structure and occurrence of indicator species. The mean size of the WKHs varies considerably, from 0.7 ha (Finland) to 4.6 ha (Sweden). The degree of formal protection also differs. Preservation of WKHs is primarily based on forest legislation in Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and on forest certification in the other countries. The implementation of the WKH concept is inconsistent between the countries, resulting in different sets of habitats being included in the WKH networks. This makes direct comparisons between the countries difficult, and may hamper the generalization of research results into other areas.;biodiversity and conservation and forest certification and forest legislation and forest management and production forest and FOREST and BIODIVERSITY and Europe;10.1080/02827581.2010.497160     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""0282-7581"", ""1651-1891     J9  - SCAND J FOREST RES     JI  - Scand.

However, it is uninformative on the prevalence of perspectives in the general population. The Norwegian government considers planting spruce climate forests on abandoned pastures, the habitat for many red listed species. We identify three prevailing stakeholder perspectives in the climate forest debate using the Q method; one pro climate forest and two against with differing motivations. Using the so-called scale creation method (Danielson, 2009) and a national survey, we measure the support of the general population for these perspectives and elicit their concern for ecosystem services. About half of the sample is pro climate forest. Opposition is greater in regions where spruce is uncommon and abandoned pastures are common. The impact of climate forests on biodiversity and landscapes is a concern. Conflicts would be dampened if climate forest policy took impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity better into account. Our proposed generalised Q method combines two strengths: the depth of the Q method with the breadth of the general population survey.

This paper describes the scientific foundation for management according to conservation limits and management targets for Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon, a highly valued and heavily exploited anadromous fish species. Based on stock recruitment relationships during the freshwater phase, the biomass of females necessary to attain the carrying capacity (yielding average maximum recruitment) has been established as conservation limits for each of the 439 Norwegian populations. Using a simulation model based on reported catch and estimates of exploitation rates, the probability and percentage attainment of the conservation limits have been assessed annually since 2008, and exploitation advice provided for 176 of the largest populations. The number of populations that attained their conservation limits increased substantially after the new management scheme was introduced, despite that the number of returning salmon remained at historical low levels. Overall the populations evaluated in 2011 were at 95% of their conservation limits compared to 91% in 2008 and 85% in 2005. The improvement could largely be attributed to reduced exploitation rates, due to new restrictions in both the marine and river fisheries. The new management scheme also improved the catch statistics and stimulated data acquisition for management. Implementation of management according to conservation limits has been a success in terms of attaining the main management goal of protectingtheAtlanticsalmonpopulationsbyensuring that an increasing number of the populations likely are at their maximum reproductive capacity.

Having major implications for the abilities of actors to pursue their interests in practical forest management, the methodologies of biodiversity mapping have been highly controversial and contested. We identify two different forest ontologies, or realities, that were enacted by the two main competing methodologies for such mapping. The methodologies, SiS and EiF, were supported by what we term the environmental and the forestry segments, respectively. Whereas a mapping approach associated with the environmental segment enacted a varied and complex forest ontology, a mapping approach related to the forestry segment enacted a comprehensible and more standardized forest ontology. In analyzing the two ontologies, we explore the links between the configuration of the mapping methodologies and 1) the forest realities they enact, 2) the scientific ideals they advocate, and 3) the relationship between mapping and management decisions. In particular, we argue that the ontologies have different political implications, generally favoring the actors that support them. On a more general level, we show that ontological politics is performed in the enactment of different ontologies related to different political segments, associated with different sectors. © 2022;Biodiversity mapping and Forest governance and Ontological politics and Norway and biodiversity and forest management and governance approach and habitat loss and mapping and politics and article and forest and forestry and ontology and Trees;10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.015;14629011 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: H.

However, not all land use is equal, and many traditional land uses, and emergent cultural landscapes support important biodiversity and provide multiple benefits to society. Despite their importance, cultural landscapes are threatened by several factors, the most prominent being abandonment of the traditional practices that maintain them. Afforestation schemes to mitigate atmospheric carbon are an additional emerging threat. Abandonment and afforestation threaten both ecological processes and socio-cultural values, but surprisingly, there is little knowledge on the concurrent social and ecological impacts. We used a multi-method approach of ecological field surveys to quantify the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services (ES) in four different vegetation types representing managed open vegetation, natural forest types for abandonment and planted forests to represent afforestation. We explored the match and/or mismatch between socio-cultural values and biophysical supply of ES in those vegetation types and investigated the socio-demographic factors that influence socio-cultural values for ES. Biophysical supply of ES was variable across vegetation types and synergies were as common as trade-offs. Socio-cultural values were high for most ES in open vegetation and natural forests and low for planted forests. Biophysical supply and socio-cultural values were well matched across the vegetation types for biodiversity and agricultural products, but strongly mismatched for climate regulation. We show that although trade-offs occur both within value- and between value domains, synergies are also common. Our results show that abandonment would impact on the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of some ES but that this impact would be lower than that of afforestation. We argue that our approach can be used to manage trade-offs and enhance synergies between value domains for a holistic approach to landscape stewardship that supports both people and nature.;NA;10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106967;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

For this purpose, we turn to environmental psychology and use place attachment, the functional and emotional bond people have to a defined place. We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model. Place attachment may provide valuable information on the affected populations when evaluating land-use policies.;NA;10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106971;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

According to WWF’s last living planet index, one million species are risking extinction, leading to a need for a criminology that addresses the multifarious reasons for this situation, which to large degree is lacking. In this article, I apply perspectives from Green Criminology, Environmental Restorative Justice and Species Restorative Justice to argue for the necessity of these to address species loss and animal abuse caused by wildlife trade and hunting. The implementation of two prominent nature conservation conventions, CITES and the Bern convention, are central in the discussion, with Norway as the case, through which it is shown that these fail to provide endangered wildlife with protection. © The Author(s) 2023.;Animal rights and Bern convention and CITES and Green Criminology and Species Restorative Justice and wildlife trade;10.1177/17488958231181309;17488958 (ISSN);NA;"Export Date: 29 January 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.

High infection levels of salmon lice, and high proportions of escaped farmed salmon in spawning rivers, appear to violate the goals in the Strategy for an Environmentally Sustainable Aquaculture Industry' set by the Norwegian government. An overview of the anadromous populations in the fjord, their status and the major threats are presented. A conservation plan with mitigation efforts consisting of seven steps is presented: (1) genetic assessment of Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout populations, (2) reducing gene flow from escapees, (3) reducing infection pressure from salmon lice, (4) conduct an assessment of the freshwater habitats for anadromous salmonids and then implement it in order to restore smolt production, (5) efforts to reduce risk of river pollution from agriculture and industry and minimize impacts from hydropower production, (6) when and where necessary and practical, plant out eyed eggs from the Norwegian Genebank to increase parr and smolt production, and finally, (7) monitor spawning populations and parr densities to evaluate potential effects of the mitigation efforts. Experience and knowledge gained through the plan will be useful for other regions with similar challenges. We call for an initiative to establish a national fund under democratic and public control, where funding can be obtained for projects which focus on mitigation efforts and conservation of salmonid populations.;Anadromous salmonids and threats and salmon farming and hydropower development and stock rehabilitation and CHINOOK SALMON and WILD and RIVER and FLOW and POPULATIONS and HYBRID and FISH and LICE and L. and CONSEQUENCES and Norway;10.1080/17451000.2013.810758     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"[""1745-1000"", ""1745-1019     J9  - MAR BIOL RES     JI  - Mar.

This bears hydromorphological pressures which are important factors causing lowered ecological status. Water level fluctuation triggers erosion on the shoreline and, depending on fluctuation range, also affects species composition or disappearance of sensitive aquatic macrophytes. We developed a water level-drawdown index (WIc) for Nordic lakes using macrophyte data from 73 lakes with varying water level fluctuation in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The index is based on the ratio between sensitive and tolerant macrophyte species. The sensitive and tolerant species are identified based on a percentile approach, analysing the presence or absence of species along the winter drawdown range. The index correlates well with winter drawdown in Finnish and Norwegian lakes with strongest correlations with winter drawdown in storage lakes (lakes regulated for hydroelectric power and with a considerable winter drawdown). The WIc-index is applicable in low alkalinity, oligotrophic and ice-covered lakes, and is suggested to be a useful tool to identify and designate heavily modified water bodies in Nordic lakes according to the European Water Framework Directive.;NA;10.1007/s10750-012-1323-6;NA;NA;NA;2012;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
