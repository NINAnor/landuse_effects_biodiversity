TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Different Environmental Factor Impacts on Land Cover in Nisos Elafonisos, Crete, Greece
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land Cover monitoring is an essential task for a better understanding of the ecosystem’s dynamicity and complexity. The availability of Remote Sensing data improved the Land Use Land Cover mapping as it is routine work in ecosystem management. The complexity of the Mediterranean ecosystems involves a complexity of the surrounding environmental factors. An attempt to quantitatively investigate the interdependencies between land covers and affected environmental factors was conducted in Nisos Elafonisos to represent diverse and fragile coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Sentinel-2 (MSI) sensor and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to classify the LULC as well as to draw different vegetation conditions over the designated study area. DEM derivatives were conducted and incorporated. The developed methodology is intended to assess the land use land cover for different practices under the present environmental condition of Nisos Elafonisos. Supervised classification resulted in six different land cover clusters and was tested against three different environmental clusters. The findings of the current research pointed out that the environmental variables are independent and there is a vertical distribution of the vegetation according to altitude.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dependency of NDVI Satellite Imagery in Predicting Bird Diversity over France
PY  - 2018
AB  - Continuous-based predictors of habitat characteristics derived from satellite imagery are increasingly used in species distribution models (SDM). This is especially the case of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which provides estimates of vegetation productivity and heterogeneity. However, when NDVI predictors are incorporated into SDM, synchrony between biological observations and image acquisition must be questionned. Due to seasonal variations of NDVI during the year, landscape patterns of habitats are revealed differently from one date to another leading to variations in models' performance. In this paper, we investigated the influence of acquisition time period of NDVI to explain and predict bird community patterns over France. We examined if the NDVI acquisition period that best fit the bird data depends on the dominant land cover context. We also compared models based on single time period of NDVI with one model built from the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) components which summarize variations in vegetation phenology throughout the year from the fraction of radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR). Bird species richness was calculated as response variable for 759 plots of 4 km(2) from the French Breeding Bird Survey. Bird specialists and generalists to habitat were considered. NDVI and DHI predictors were both derived from MODIS products. For NDVI, five time periods in 2010 were compared, from late winter to begin of autumn. A climate predictor was also used and Generalized Additive Models were fitted to explain and predict bird species richness. Results showed that NDVI-based proxies of dominant habitat identity and spatial heterogeneity explain more bird community patterns than DHI-based proxies of annual productivity and seasonnality. We also found that models' performance was both time and context-dependent, varying according to the bird groups. In general, best time period of NDVI did not match with the acquisition period of bird data because in case of synchrony, differences in habitats are less pronounced. These findings suggest that the most powerful approach to estimate bird community patterns is the simplest one. It only requires NDVI predictors from a single appropriate time period, in addition to climate, which makes the approach very operational.

TI  - Managing predators, managing reindeer: contested conceptions of predator policies in Finland's southeast reindeer herding area
PY  - 2011
AB  - Preserving biodiversity and establishing healthy and thriving populations of predator animals are the expressed aims of many wildlife and ecosystem conservation projects and initiatives. However, such conservation strategies are often in conflict with the traditions, practices and land-use priorities of local communities. This article concentrates on the situation concerning the predation of reindeer (mainly by wolves) in Finland's southeast reindeer herding area and its immediate vicinity, but makes reference to the broader situation of predation and reindeer herding in Finland. Based on analysis of statistics and interviews with local stakeholders, the research findings refer to the intermingled contradictions related to conceptual, statistical and other management relevant knowledge and resulting problems, for example, in conservation hunting licensing. The article concludes that the wolf comprises a complex case for nature conservation initiatives and sustainable reindeer husbandry and that, in practice, it has particular implications compared to other policy approaches to dealing with the problem of animal predators. The article ends with some theoretical considerations as to whether we can improve our understanding of modern human-environment relations by deriving ideas from the actor-network theory debates.

TI  - Combining modelling tools to evaluate a goose management scheme
PY  - 2017
AB  - Many goose species feed on agricultural land, and with growing goose numbers, conflicts with agriculture are increasing. One possible solution is to designate refuge areas where farmers are paid to leave geese undisturbed. Here, we present a generic modelling tool that can be used to designate the best locations for refuges and to gauge the area needed to accommodate the geese. With a species distribution model, locations are ranked according to goose suitability. The size of the area to be designated as refuge can be chosen by including more or less suitable locations. A resource depletion model is then used to estimate whether enough resources are available within the designated refuge to accommodate all geese, taking into account the dynamics of food resources, including depletion by geese. We illustrate this with the management scheme for pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus implemented in Norway. Here, all geese can be accommodated, but damage levels appear to depend on weather, land use and refuge size.

TI  - Understanding people's ideas on natural resource management: research on social representations of nature
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ongoing fragmentation between social groups on the appropriate targets and relevant actors for nature conservation signals the need for further advancements in theorizing about the human–nature interaction. Through a focus on the complexity of social thought and confrontations between social groups, the theory of social representations may provide a useful addition to conventional approaches. However, environmental issues have so far not been among the primary topics studied by social representation scholars. This article sets out to fill this gap. After an introduction to the theory, we report on three case studies that illustrate the use of this theory in the context of natural resource management. These studies show how groups negotiate meanings, intentions, and action related to complex issues such as wolf management, invasive species, and conflicts over protected forests, landscapes, and national parks. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of the approach and suggest future challenges and opportunities.

TI  - A 500-year history of forest fires in Sala area, central Sweden, shows the earliest known onset of fire suppression in Scandinavia
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Sala fire in the Vastmanland County of central Sweden that burned about 14,000 ha in 2014 has been the largest fire recorded in the modern history of Sweden. To understand the long-term fire history of this area, we dendrochronologically dated fire scars on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees (live and deadwood) to reconstruct the fire cycle and fire occurrence in the area affected by the 2014 fire. We identified 64 fire years, using a total of 378 pine samples. The earliest reconstructed fire dated back to 1113 AD. The spatial reconstruction extended over the period of 1480–2018 AD. Lower levels of fire activity (fire cycle, FC = 43 years, with the central 90% of the distribution limited by 35 to 57 years) dominated in the earlier period (1480–1690 AD) that was followed by a strong decrease in fire activity since 1700 (FC = 403 years, with 90% of the distribution being within 149 to 7308 years), with a fire-free period between 1756 and 2014. Sala area, therefore, features the earliest known onset of fire suppression in Scandinavia. The high demand for timber during the peak in mining activities in the study area around the 1700–1800s, accompanied by passive fire suppression policies, were possibly the main drivers of the decline in fire activity. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) did not show significant departures in the drought proxy during the ten years with the largest area burned between 1480 and1690. It is unclear whether the result is due to the relatively small area sampled or an indication that human controls of fires dominated during that period. However, significant departures during the following period with low fire activity (1700–1756), which just preceded the last fire-free period, suggested that the climate became an increasingly important driver of fire during the onset of the suppression period. We speculate that the lack of major firebreaks, the homogenization of forests, and the lack of burned areas with low fuel loads might contribute to the occurrence of the exceptionally large 2014 fire in Sala.

TI  - Who let the wolves out? Narratives, rumors and social representations of the wolf in Greece
PY  - 2016
AB  - As a way of coping with uncertainty and threats to their livelihoods following wolf reintroduction, livestock breeders in Greece deploy incriminating rumors about the wolf and the premises and actors around its reintroduction. In this paper, we identify the social representations with which livestock breeders make sense of and constitute the wolf as a social object. Through Moscovici’s social representations framework, we show how enduring and contemporary (corresponding to core and peripheral) attributions formalize into coherent narratives and become designated as rumors by their unverified, third-party nature. To this end, the two rumors that dominate in Greece as well as the rest of Europe are that of wolves being secretly released by NGOs and wolves as genetically impure hybrids. These become counter-narratives to the dominant truth and function as the currency of the voiceless in wolf conservation. The paper situates these rumors in a global context of contemporary conspiracy theories on the wolf cu...

TI  - Effects of camera-trap placement and number on detection of members of a mammalian assemblage
PY  - 2021
AB  - A central goal in camera-trapping (CT) studies is to maximize detection probability and precision of occupancy estimates while minimizing the number of CTs to reduce equipment and labor costs. Few studies, however, have examined the effect of CT number on detection probability. Moreover, historically, most studies focused on a specific species and the design could be tailored toward maximizing detection of this target species. Increasingly, however, such studies use data for all captured, non-target, species (by-catch data) for animal community-level analyses. It remains unclear if, and how, the targeting of CTs toward one species affects the detection of non-target species. We paired CTs from a permanent camera-trapping grid (with 38 CTs) targeted at monitoring Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Innlandet County, Norway, with additional randomly placed CTs at two spatial scales (38 CTs within the same habitat patch and 38 CTs within the same 50-km2 grid cell as the lynx-targeted CTs) for three months. We combined multi-scale occupancy models that enable the separation of large-scale occupancy, CT-scale site use, and detection probability with single-scale occupancy models. This allowed us to study the effects of targeted placement and CT number on the detection probability of the target species (lynx) and seven non-target mammal species (four carnivores, three herbivores, and one rodent). We found that all species, except moose (Alces alces), had the highest detection probability at lynx-targeted CTs. Moose had equal detection probabilities at all three placement types. Adding extra CTs generally increased detection probabilities. Consequently, for all species, combining a lynx-targeted CT with one or more randomly placed CTs, increased the accuracy and precision of occupancy estimates for 50-km2 grid cells compared to single CT estimates. The placement of single CTs underestimated grid-cell occupancy compared to known minimum occupancy and were similar to site-use probability estimates of multi-scale models. It is, however, uncertain to which spatial extent these site-use probabilities refer. We therefore recommend the use of multiple (targeted) CTs to estimate occupancy in large grid cells and to interpret occupancy estimates from single CTs as site use of an, as of yet undefined, area surrounding the CT.

TI  - Habitat selection by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is primarily driven by avoidance of human activity during day and prey availability during night.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The greatest threat to the protected Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Central Europe is human-induced mortality. As the availability of lynx prey often peaks in human-modified areas, lynx have to balance successful prey hunting with the risk of encounters with humans. We hypothesized that lynx minimize this risk by adjusting habitat choices to the phases of the day and over seasons. We predicted that (1) due to avoidance of human-dominated areas during daytime, lynx range use is higher at nighttime, that (2) prey availability drives lynx habitat selection at night, whereas high cover, terrain inaccessibility, and distance to human infrastructure drive habitat selection during the day, and that (3) habitat selection also differs between seasons, with altitude being a dominant factor in winter. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed telemetry data (GPS, VHF) of 10 lynx in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem (Germany, Czech Republic) between 2005 and 2013 using generalized additive mixed models and considering various predictor variables. Night ranges exceeded day ranges by more than 10%. At night, lynx selected open habitats, such as meadows, which are associated with high ungulate abundance. By contrast, during the day, lynx selected habitats offering dense understorey cover and rugged terrain away from human infrastructure. In summer, land-cover type greatly shaped lynx habitats, whereas in winter, lynx selected lower altitudes. We concluded that open habitats need to be considered for more realistic habitat models and contribute to future management and conservation (habitat suitability, carrying capacity) of Eurasian lynx in Central Europe.

TI  - Incorporating estimates of capture probability and river network covariance in novel habitat – abundance models: Assessing the effects of conservation stocking on catchment-scale production of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from a long-term electrofishing dataset
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract There are increasing calls for “conservation stocking” to counter declines in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations, the assumption being that stocking can bypass population bottlenecks and increase recruitment over natural processes. However, there are too few quantitative studies with sufficient data to assess the efficacy of conservation stocking. The Girnock Burn is a unique long-term monitoring site where adult and juvenile salmon numbers have been monitored for over 50 years, including 11 years with conservation stocking. Adults were monitored at a fixed trap and juveniles were monitored by electrofishing. In stocked years, ova were incubated in surface water to reduce density-independent over-winter mortality. In eight years, eyed ova were stocked at uniform densities to reduce local density-dependence. In three years, stocking replicated natural spatial variability in ova deposition removing any potential benefits of reduced local density-dependence. Juvenile production was estimated by summing the product of reach-scale density estimates and river area obtained from a novel spatial statistical river network model that incorporated the effects of capture probability, habitat and stock level. Capture probability varied with life-stage (age 0+ fry or ≥1+ parr), electrofishing pass and day of the year, but importantly also exhibited a positive temporal trend across years. Survival from ova to fry was density-independent and higher under uniform stocking than natural spawning or simulated natural spawning. Under uniform stocking, fry densities varied smoothly with altitude, while under natural spawning and simulated natural spawning, fry exhibited a more patchy distribution. Increased fry production did not translate to increased parr production, which was strongly density-dependent. This likely reflected the inability of fry to move between stocked locations and suitable overwintering habitat, decreasing survival between fry and parr life-stages. Consequently, there was no overall benefit of stocking. The modelling framework used in this study provides a valuable approach for interpreting long-term datasets where site locations, equipment and staffing vary over time. The long-term Girnock dataset was valuable in separating management action from natural population regulation and permitting understanding of ecological processes. The study indicates that conservation stocking can be ineffective, even where implemented to best scientific standards. It is therefore recommended that a detailed understanding of local population dynamics is obtained, and a realistic appraisal of the expected benefits of stocking is undertaken, before management actions are considered.

TI  - Effect of microhabitat characteristics for predicting habitat suitability for a stalking large carnivore—the Eurasian lynx in middle Europe
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Large European carnivores are generally considered forest animals. However, there are a number of interacting factors that may have different impact on the availability and suitability of habitat for individual species. Felids, because of their stalking hunting mode, are habitat specialists requiring a heterogeneous environment, making them specifically vulnerable to habitat disturbance. The Eurasian lynx (<jats:italic>Lynx lynx</jats:italic>), despite protection in many European countries, has a surprisingly limited range. To explain environmental factors that affect its distribution, we undertook habitat selection and habitat suitability analyses at the macrohabitat and microhabitat scales, based on lynx occurrence and environmental data in Poland. Since the species occurs in two populations, one of which inhabits lowland and the other mountainous area, we modelled habitat suitability separately in both areas and then extrapolated it for the whole country scale. The lynx selected forests with medium undergrowth density in the lowlands and highly rugged terrain in the mountain areas—a proxy of stalking cover. Habitat suitability modelling performed at the macrohabitat scale identified around 110 000 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of habitat available from which 55 700 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> was classified as high quality including large tracts of forests in western Poland that are beyond the natural range of the lynx. However, the microhabitat model built by including stalking cover variables, decreased high‐quality habitats to only 33% of the area designated at the macrohabitat scale. This model is largely consistent with the current distribution of lynx in Poland. This suggests that the simplified internal structure of forests (lacking understory cover) may act as a hindrance to increasing the distribution of lynx populations and helps to explain its limited range in the Central European lowlands. This research suggests that the microhabitat structure may play the crucial role in the effective conservation of the Eurasian lynx.</jats:p>

TI  - Analyzing historical land use changes using a Historical Land Use Reconstruction Model: a case study in Zhenlai County, northeastern China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Historical land use information is essential to understanding the impact of anthropogenic modification of land use/cover on the temporal dynamics of environmental and ecological issues. However, due to a lack of spatial explicitness, complete thematic details and the conversion types for historical land use changes, the majority of historical land use reconstructions do not sufficiently meet the requirements for an adequate model. Considering these shortcomings, we explored the possibility of constructing a spatially-explicit modeling framework (HLURM: Historical Land Use Reconstruction Model). Then a three-map comparison method was adopted to validate the projected reconstruction map. The reconstruction suggested that the HLURM model performed well in the spatial reconstruction of various land-use categories, and had a higher figure of merit (48.19%) than models used in other case studies. The largest land use/cover type in the study area was determined to be grassland, followed by arable land and wetland. Using the three-map comparison, we noticed that the major discrepancies in land use changes among the three maps were as a result of inconsistencies in the classification of land-use categories during the study period, rather than as a result of the simulation model.

TI  - Landscape selection by migratory geese: implications for hunting organisation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Over the last decades, many wild goose populations have increased significantly and are now causing conflicts with socioeconomic and biological interests. To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trondelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large field...

TI  - Transhumance as a driving force of landscape change in the marginal grabens of northern Ethiopia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Transhumance between the Afar lowlands and Tigray escarpments has been a common practice in northern Ethiopia. However, the impact of transhumance on landscape changes in the marginal grabens has not been significantly researched. Hence, this study aims to understand the process of transhumance and the linkages between social and biophysical aspects of the graben landscapes of northern Ethiopia. Google Earth (2010-2016) and Landsat Imageries (1995-2015) were used to analyse the spatio-temporal landscape changes. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to measure the change in vegetation cover. Interview and Focus Group Discussions were used to collect perceptions of communities on transhumance and landscape change. The findings reveal that transhumance caused conflicts between the lowlanders and highlanders, which in turn led to displacement of communities. Consequently, the NDVI value of the abandoned settlement increased over time. Conversely, the analysis of Google Earth Imageries and NDVI values show that vegetation cover of the new settlement has decreased. Moreover, the NDVI values of the transhumance areas showed little increase due to the establishments of exclosures in the escarpments. The findings of this study can, therefore, be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at solving transhumance-induced conflicts, displacement of communities and conservation of natural resources.

TI  - Development of land use and main land use change processes in the period 1836–2006: case study in the Czech Republic
PY  - 2012
AB  - Two different sets of maps, on a scale of 1:110,000, show the development of land use and main land use change processes in a 500 km2 study area that occurred over the last 170 years. Analytical maps of land use were derived from old topographical military maps, as well as from base maps, using five time periods by the process of on-screen digitization. These analytical maps formed a basis for synthetic maps of land use change processes, number of changes, stably used areas and land use change trajectories. Maps of land use change processes record the spatial distribution of main processes that occurred between two adjacent time steps. The overall dynamics of land use changes are depicted in the map of land use change trajectories. The map of the number of changes shows how many times land use was changed in the given plot, while the map of stably used areas gives an idea of which land use categories did not change during the researched period.

TI  - On the Prospects of In Situ Conservation of Medicinal- and Aromatic-Plant Genetic Resources at Ancient-Hillfort Sites: A Case Study from Lithuania.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Twenty-three ancient-hillfort sites were investigated to evaluate the potential for the in situ conservation of medicinal- and aromatic-plant populations. An evaluation of the site's suitability was carried out by employing three major groups of criteria: species-specific, site-specific, and threat assessment. The species-specific criteria included the total species number, target species number, the cover-abundance of the target species estimated by mean Braun-Blanquet score, and, as an additional criterion, the number and cover-abundance of crop wild relatives. The site-specific criteria included site evaluation with respect to climatic region, the area size of a site, the habitat type, and the site's protection status. The threat assessment was focused on anthropogenic activities, such as recreational, agricultural, and others. The total number of vascular plant species inventoried was 264, including 82 species of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP). There was a strong and highly significant correlation between the total and the MAP species numbers (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.77, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and the two most species-rich sites, Žuklijai and Pamiškė, contained the highest total and MAP species numbers. The investigated hillfort sites covered the populations of 49 species, or about 33% of the priority species list, with 5 or more populations. The most frequent species, <i>Hypericum perforatum</i>, occurred at 21 sites. The twenty-three hillfort sites represent three of the four climatic regions and six of the ten climatic subregions of Lithuania. Although these hillfort sites are quite small (1.24 ± 0.75 ha on average, without buffer zone), they are scattered across the country and are state-protected as archaeological objects, which makes them suitable for the in situ conservation of MAP genetic resources. In addition, seven hillfort sites (30.4% of the investigated ones) belong to the European network of special areas of conservation of habitats (Natura 2000), thus increasing their international importance. The threat assessment showed that anthropogenic activities (recreational, agricultural, etc.) are among the major factors affecting target-species populations.

TI  - Warranty for a better world? The politics of environmental knowledge in bioeconomic sustainability certificates.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Sustainability certificates are increasingly used as tools for shaping bioeconomic production processes and trade. However, their specific effects are subjected to debate. A multitude of certificate schemes and standards are currently in use, defining and measuring sustainability in the bioeconomy in highly varying ways. Different representations of environmental effects, resulting from the use of different standards or scientific methods in certification, can have very real implications for how, where and to which degree bioeconomic production can be conducted and the environment will be conserved. Further, the implications for bioeconomic production practices and management embedded in the environmental knowledge employed in bioeconomic sustainability certificates will produce different winners and losers, and privilege some societal or individual concerns at the expense of others. In this way, sustainability certificates share some characteristics with other standards and policy tools that embody political contingencies, but are presented and often understood as objective and neutral. The paper argues that the politics of environmental knowledge involved in these processes warrant more awareness, scrutiny and explicit consideration from decision makers, policy developers and researchers.

TI  - Temporal Assessment of Eastern Spotted Skunk Geographic Distribution
PY  - 2021
AB  - Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk) experienced range-wide population declines beginning in the mid-1900s with no clear understanding of the causal mechanism or whether such declines were associated with range contractions. Species-distribution models can provide a powerful framework to assess changes in landscape suitability in response to changing environmental conditions. Herein, we modeled time-stepped distributions of suitable environmental conditions for Eastern Spotted Skunks from 1938 to 2016 in Maxent, incorporating climate and land-cover predictors. Climate and land-cover variables reliably predicted landscape suitability of Eastern Spotted Skunks over time. We found a 37% decline in suitable area from historic predictions, consistent with reports of population declines in these areas. Our predicted landscape-suitability maps can be used to evaluate the current distribution of environmentally suitable conditions for the species as well as guide research and conservation efforts.

TI  - A 12% switch from monogastric to ruminant livestock production can reduce emissions and boost crop production for 525 million people.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ruminants have lower feed use efficiency than monogastric livestock, and produce higher reactive nitrogen and methane emissions, but can utilize human-inedible biomass through foraging and straw feedstock. Here we conduct a counterfactual analysis, replacing ruminants with monogastric livestock to quantify the changes in nitrogen loss and greenhouse gas emissions globally from a whole life cycle perspective. Switching 12% of global livestock production from monogastric to ruminant livestock could reduce nitrogen emissions by 2% and greenhouse gas emissions by 5% due to land use change and lower demand for cropland areas for ruminant feed. The output from released cropland could feed up to 525 million people worldwide. More ruminant products, in addition to optimized management, would generate overall benefits valued at US$468 billion through reducing adverse impacts on human and ecosystem health, and mitigating climate impacts.

TI  - HIS - Assessing Impacts of Low Flow on Kainji Hydro-Power Generation
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study investigates potential changes to hydropower generation using diverse efficiency indexes (EIs) under climate change scenarios of different water year types including “dry” defined as the lower 20 percentile, “normal” as the middle 60 percentile, and “wet” as the upper 20 percentile from the low flow frequency analysis (LFFA) in retrofitting the hydropower description relative to the current conditions. For this study, the multiple linear regression model was fitted to the annual minimum 1 of 7-day average flows with recurrence intervals of 1, 3, 7, 15, or 30 years which were computed using the log-Pearson Type III mathematical technique (LPIII). The climatic impacts’ scenarios results of different water year types’ likelihoods of exceedance give the total annual hydropower as 0.631 MW, 0.550 MW, and 0.392 MW respectively for the lower 20 percentile while the equivalent reservoir inflows result shows an upwards trend in total amounts of runoff, though the patterns of possible changes are both temporally and spatially complex. It is thus important to understand stream and catchment behaviors during the period of limited flow in both natural and under various anthropogenic events. This will provide useful information for long-term river basin management under climate-change conditions which is also necessary for supporting aquatic lives.

TI  - When a Shark Is More Than a Shark: A Sociopolitical Problem-Solving Approach to Fisher-Shark Interactions
PY  - 2021
AB  - Fisheries are often conceptualized through a biophysical lens resulting in management approaches that fail to account for stakeholder conflicts and sociopolitical inequities. Using a fisher engagement approach, this case study examines the sociopolitical dimensions of fisher-shark interactions in pursuit of more complete problem definitions and effective solutions. Through interviews with Hawaiʻi small boat fishers and observations of a community-based shark-tagging project, we examined fisher perspective, socioeconomic landscapes, stakeholder relationships, and power dynamics. We interpreted these data using an adapted framework that mobilizes concepts from conflict theory and problem definition. We discovered that economic cost, sharks as fishing competitors, and factors of fishers’ on-the-water decisions define the fisher-shark interaction problem at the dispute level. Deeper conflicts include fishers’ poor perceptions of management legitimacy, degraded relationships with researchers and managers, threatened fisher identities, and poor enforcement capacity. Together, dispute and deeper conflicts limit the effectiveness of singular approaches (e.g., regulation) to mitigate fisher-shark interactions and necessitate multi-pronged solutions with substance-, process-, and relationships-based components. This case study documented one such multi-pronged strategy employing fisher-researcher knowledge exchange, collaborative research, and means of more transparent communication. This strategy has the potential to affect both dispute- and deeper-level outcomes by advancing collective understanding of sharks and shark-handling tools, fisher behavior, and reducing shark mortality. Thus, a sociopolitical approach to problem-solving may yield greater collective benefits to fisheries stakeholders and sharks, with broader implications for the systemic management of complex human and biophysical ecosystem components.

TI  - Community‐level and phenological responses of emerging aquatic insects exposed to 3 neonicotinoid insecticides: An in situ wetland limnocorral approach
PY  - 2018
AB  - Seasonal aquatic insect emergence represents a critical subsidy link between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Early and late instar larvae developing in wetlands near neonicotinoid-treated cropland can be at risk of chronic insecticide exposure. In the present study, an in situ wetland limnocorral experiment compared emergent insect community responses to imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Twenty-one limnocorrals were dosed weekly for 9 wk to target peak nominal doses of 0.0, 0.05, or 0.5 μg/L, followed by a 6-wk recovery period. Thirty-nine aquatic insect taxa were recorded but 11 taxa groups made up 97% of the community composition. Principal response curves (PRCs) indicated that during the dosing period, community composition among the treatments resembled the controls. During the 6-wk recovery period, significant deviance was observed in the high imidacloprid treatment with similar trends in the clothianidin treatment, suggesting that community effects from neonicotinoid exposure can be delayed. Non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) and damselflies (Odonata: Zygoptera) emerged 18 to 25 d earlier than controls in the imidacloprid and clothianidin neonicotinoid treatments, with no effects from thiamethoxam treatments. These data suggest that phenology and subtle community effects can occur at measured neonicotinoid concentrations of 0.045 (imidacloprid) and 0.038 μg/L (clothianidin) under chronic repeated exposure conditions. Synchronization and community dynamics are critical to aquatic insects and consumers; thus, neonicotinoids may have broad implications for wetland ecosystem function.

AB  - AbstractIn most rewilding projects, humans are still the agents in control: it is us who decide to no longer want to fully control nature. Spontaneous rewilding changes the nature of this game. Once we are confronted with species that have their own agency, that cannot fully be controlled, and that behave in ways that we do not always like, then it proves hard to co-exist and tolerate nature’s autonomy. Nowhere is this more clearly visible than with the resurging wolf, whose return to parts of western Europe challenges our existing ideas about ourselves and our place in the landscape.

TI  - Patterns of coyote predation on sheep in California: A socio-ecological approach to mapping risk of livestock–predator conflict
PY  - 2020
AB  - Author(s): McInturff, Alex; Miller, Jennifer R. B; Gaynor, Kaitlyn M; Brashares, Justin S | Abstract: Conflict between livestock producers and wild predators is a central driver of large predator declines and simultaneously may imperil the lives and livelihoods of livestock producers. There is a growing recognition that livestock–predator conflict is a socio‐ecological problem, but few case studies exist to guide conflict research and management from this point of view. Here we present a case study of coyote‐sheep predation on a California ranch in which we combine methods from the rapidly growing field of predation risk modeling with participatory mapping of perceptions of predation risk. Our findings reveal an important selection bias that may occur when producer perceptions and decisions are excluded from ecological methods of studying conflict. We further demonstrate how producer inputs, participatory mapping, and ecological modeling of conflict can inform one another in understanding patterns, drivers, and management opportunities for livestock–predator conflict. Finally, we make recommendations for improving the interoperability of ecological and social data about predation risk. Collectively our methods offer a socio‐ecological approach that fills important research gaps and offers guidance to future research.

TI  - Poor prey quality is compensated by higher provisioning effort in passerine birds.
PY  - 2021
AB  - In altricial avian species, nutrition can significantly impact nestling fitness by increasing their survival and recruitment chances after fledging. Therefore, the effort invested by parents towards provisioning nestlings is crucial and represents a critical link between habitat resources and reproductive success. Recent studies suggest that the provisioning rate has little or no effect on the nestling growth rate. However, these studies do not consider prey quality, which may force breeding pairs to adjust provisioning rates to account for variation in prey nutritional value. In this 8-year study using black-capped (Poecile atricapillus) and boreal (Poecile hudsonicus) chickadees, we hypothesized that provisioning rates would negatively correlate with prey quality (i.e., energy content) across years if parents adjust their effort to maintain nestling growth rates. The mean daily growth rate was consistent across years in both species. However, prey energy content differed among years, and our results showed that parents brought more food to the nest and fed at a higher rate in years of low prey quality. This compensatory effect likely explains the lack of relationship between provisioning rate and growth rate reported in this and other studies. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that parents increase provisioning efforts to compensate for poor prey quality and maintain offspring growth rates.

TI  - Millennial-Scale Disturbance History of the Boreal Zone
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Long-term disturbance histories, reconstructed using diverse paleoecological tools, provide high-quality information about pre-observational periods. These data offer a portrait of past environmental variability for understanding the long-term patterns in climate and disturbance regimes and the forest ecosystem response to these changes. Paleoenvironmental records also provide a longer-term context against which current anthropogenic-related environmental changes can be evaluated. Records of the long-term interactions between disturbances, vegetation, and climate help guide forest management practices that aim to mirror “natural” disturbance regimes. In this chapter, we outline how paleoecologists obtain these long-term data sets and extract paleoenvironmental information from a range of sources. We demonstrate how the reconstruction of key disturbances in the boreal forest, such as fire and insect outbreaks, provides critical long-term views of disturbance-climate-vegetation interactions. Recent developments of novel proxies are highlighted to illustrate advances in reconstructing millennial-scale disturbance-related dynamics and how this new information benefits the sustainable management of boreal forests in a rapidly changing climate.</jats:p>

TI  - The effect of rapid social changes during post-communist transition on perceptions of the human - wolf relationships in Macedonia and Kyrgyzstan
PY  - 2013
AB  - The relationship between humans and wolves is often associated with conflicts strongly linked with livestock breeding activities. However, as conflicts are often more intense than expected considering the magnitude of their economic impact, some authors have suggested that these conflicts are disconnected from reality and are mainly due to persistence of negative perceptions from previous times. To the contrary, we suggest that local people’s perceptions are often linked to wolf behaviour through direct observations and interactions. We conducted ethnological investigations on human-wolf relationships in countries belonging to former USSR (Kyrgyzstan) and former Yugoslavia (Republic of Macedonia), subjected to rapid social changes impacting both livestock husbandry and hunting practices. Our studies revealed that changes in hunting and husbandry practices have led to modifications in the socio-environmental context and to the nature of wolf-human interactions. These changes have resulted in an increased vulnerability of local people to wolf damage and a concomitant reduced acceptance for wolves. All these changes contribute to changes in the perception of the wolf and to an increase in the perception of conflicts, even in countries where humans and wolves have continuously coexisted. Our study shows the dynamic nature of human-wolf relationships, the necessity to understand the broader socio-economical context in human-wildlife conflicts, and the challenge pastoralists are facing in a changing world.

TI  - Uncovering behavioural states from animal activity and site fidelity patterns
PY  - 2016
AB  - 1.Space use by animals has important implications for individual fitness. However, resource requirements often vary throughout the course of a lifetime and are a reflection of the demands associated with daily tasks or specific life history phases, from food acquisition to reproduction, and emphasize the need to classify resource selection relative to specific behavioural states. Site fidelity is often indicative of behaviours important for individual maintenance (e.g., foraging), species’ life history (e.g., seasonal site selection), social communication (e.g., scent-marking), and species interactions (e.g., predation, competition). Thus, resolving site-fidelity patterns associated with key behaviours is essential to accurately quantify behavioural-dependent resource needs and the fitness consequences of space use. 2.We propose a novel method for identifying site-fidelity patterns in animal location data using a convex hull clustering program called rASF. We also provide a means of integrating activity as a measure of behavioural state. We demonstrate the utility of the approach in identifying cougar (Puma concolor) predation events, coyote (Canis latrans) den and rendezvous sites, and coyote territorial boundaries. 3.We parameterized rASF based on site-fidelity characteristics that best characterized the clustering behaviour of interest and estimated behavioural state from either dual-axial accelerometer data or movement trajectory statistics. When behaviour was used in conjunction with cluster-specific metrics (duration, proportion of diurnal fixes, and landscape composition), we could accurately predict prey species associated with cougar kills and differentiate pup-rearing from scent-marking sites in coyotes. 4.Site-fidelity patterns and activities associated with animal revisitation will be key to identifying the behavioural motivations behind observed patterns of space use. Our approach provides an efficient, rigorous, and repeatable means of identifying site fidelity patterns associated with specific behavioural states without the need for direct observations, which are often impossible to collect at large spatial scales and in dense habitat. As such, this framework has significant potential to inform theory in behavioural ecology while providing managers with better resolution on appropriate management targets associated with key aspects of a species’ life history.

TI  - Population age structure as an indicator for assessing the quality of breeding areas of Common quail (Coturnix coturnix)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Quality breeding areas are vital for the management and conservation of migratory bird species, especially those under pressure from climate warming effects. The Common quail Coturnix coturnix is a migratory species characterized by its itinerant breeding (several breeding attempts in different places) and exposure to high mortality rates, and it is a case in point. The identification and management of high quality nesting areas is essential to conserve this and other migratory species. Here, we use a Spanish long-term quail ringing dataset (1961–2014) to correlate population age structure with temporal and geographical variables. We show that northern Mediterranean regions provide optimal breeding sites and have balanced population age structures (young:adult males). The proportion of young:adult males provides an indicator of the relative quality of various breeding areas. Records of ringed quail provide data on the overlap between young and adult males temporarily resident in different geographic areas and may provide a useful tool to evaluate habitat quality. We found that the timing of sequential breeding attempts and temporary residency of quail are associated with latitude, altitude, and geographic location of quail ringing records. In southern regions, young males arrive at the breeding area later than adults, while in northern regions young birds and adults arrive at same time. Optimal breeding areas are characterized by high quality habitat, have high quail densities, and a mixture of young and adult males, factors that favour sexual selection, heterozygosity and population viability. However, not all high quality habitat areas are suitable for reproduction, being necessary enough quail density and the adequate proportion of young:adult males.

TI  - Felid bedrooms with a panoramic view: selection of resting sites by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in a karstic landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is a crepuscular-nocturnal carnivore and mostly spends daytime resting. Although resting sites represent an important part of the lynx habitat and can be negatively affected by human activities, it is still poorly known how lynx select these sites, especially in regions with rugged topography characteristic for much of the species’ range. We analysed microscale habitat selection of lynx resting sites at the home-range level in a karstic landscape of the Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia, using a use-availability study design. We also searched for differences in the selection of resting sites in respect to the presence of ungulate kills, which often limit the available resting sites during the prey-consumption period. Using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM), we tested which environmental features and human infrastructure are important for lynx when choosing resting sites. Lynx selected mountain ridges and hilltops, as well as locations with steeper slopes and lower local visibility. Such locations likely provide concealment from potential danger or prey and, at the same time, offer good overview of the surroundings. There was also a tendency to avoid forest cabins and to select rocky terrain and southern exposures, but support in the data for this was lower. When lynx were not limited by the presence of fresh kill, the selection tended to be stronger, but the differences were not significant, except for visibility, which was lower at resting sites near prey remains. Results likely reflect high availability of suitable resting sites in a rugged terrain of karstic landscape. Animals are often most vulnerable during sleep, thus the resting site should ideally provide them with cover to reduce exposure and at the same time give them good overview of the surroundings to detect any approaching danger. We used snow tracking and GPS telemetry, for the first time in combination with data from activity sensors, to reliably determine resting sites of Eurasian lynx in a rugged karstic landscape. We showed how lynx face the trade-off of the need to be concealed, yet at the same time attain good view, by selecting structured microhabitats on top of the ridges and on steep slopes. Our results also suggest that in the regions with rugged terrain the influence of human infrastructure might be lower compared to the study areas of previous research.

TI  - Geo-Spatial Aspects of Acceptance of Illegal Hunting of Large Carnivores in Scandinavia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts are complex and are influenced by: the spatial distribution of the conflict species; the organisation and intensity of management measures such as zoning; historical experience with wildlife; land use patterns; and local cultural traditions. We have used a geographically stratified sampling of social values and attitudes to provide a novel perspective to the human - wildlife conflict. We have focused on acceptance by and disagreements between residents (measured as Potential Conflict Index; PCI) towards illegal hunting of four species of large carnivores (bear, lynx, wolf, wolverine). The study is based on surveys of residents in every municipality in Sweden and Norway who were asked their opinion on illegal hunting. Our results show how certain social values are associated with acceptance of poaching, and how these values differ geographically independent of carnivore abundance. Our approach differs from traditional survey designs, which are often biased towards urban areas. Although these traditional designs intend to be representative of a region (i.e. a random sample from a country), they tend to receive relatively few respondents from rural areas that experience the majority of conflict with carnivores. Acceptance of poaching differed significantly between Norway (12.7-15.7% of respondents) and Sweden (3.3-4.1% of respondents). We found the highest acceptance of illegal hunting in rural areas with free-ranging sheep and strong hunting traditions. Disagreements between residents (as measured by PCI) were highest in areas with intermediate population density. There was no correlation between carnivore density and either acceptance of illegal hunting or PCI. A strong positive correlation between acceptance of illegal hunting and PCI showed that areas with high acceptance of illegal hunting are areas with high potential conflict between people. Our results show that spatially-stratified surveys are required to reveal the large scale patterns in social dynamics of human-wildlife conflicts.

TI  - The wolf and the animal lover
PY  - 2016
AB  - For Aristotle a true friendship can only exist between free human beings, because true friendship is based on a shared understanding of the good. Yet today, some animal philosophers argue that friendships can exist between humans and animals, maybe not in Aristotle’s sense of the word but in another way, that appreciates how animals are different from us humans, yet also share a certain commonality. Usually, these reflections on human-animal friendship concern human relations with domestic animals, notably pets. But can we befriend wild predators, those animals that by their very nature can be dangerous to us? In this paper, I examine what it might mean to befriend a wild animal, and more specifically whether it would be possible to become friends with wild wolves. I will argue that any friendly relation with wild animals will consists of a paradoxical combination of benevolent involvement and loving detachment.

TI  - A Stacked Fully Convolutional Networks with Feature Alignment Framework for Multi-Label Land-cover Segmentation
PY  - 2019
AB  - Applying deep-learning methods, especially fully convolutional networks (FCNs), has become a popular option for land-cover classification or segmentation in remote sensing. Compared with traditional solutions, these approaches have shown promising generalization capabilities and precision levels in various datasets of different scales, resolutions, and imaging conditions. To achieve superior performance, a lot of research has focused on constructing more complex or deeper networks. However, using an ensemble of different fully convolutional models to achieve better generalization and to prevent overfitting has long been ignored. In this research, we design four stacked fully convolutional networks (SFCNs), and a feature alignment framework for multi-label land-cover segmentation. The proposed feature alignment framework introduces an alignment loss of features extracted from basic models to balance their similarity and variety. Experiments on a very high resolution(VHR) image dataset with six categories of land-covers indicates that the proposed SFCNs can gain better performance when compared to existing deep learning methods. In the 2nd variant of SFCN, the optimal feature alignment gains increments of 4.2% (0.772 vs. 0.741), 6.8% (0.629 vs. 0.589), and 5.5% (0.727 vs. 0.689) for its f1-score, jaccard index, and kappa coefficient, respectively.

TI  - Habitat preferences of adult Canada Jays (<i>Perisoreus canadensis</i>) during the post-breeding period in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> Habitat preferences in animals are often examined during the breeding period when individuals are easier to observe. However, habitat use may change once young become independent and if resource availability shifts with seasonality. While Canada Jays ( Perisoreus canadensis (Linnaeus, 1766)) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada, have been studied for several decades, there is no information on habitat use outside of the fall and late-winter nesting period, where they primarily used conifer forests. Using radio telemetry and resource selection functions comparing used versus available habitats, we estimated home-range size and habitat preferences of 12 adult Canada Jays ( n = 334 locations) in the spring and summer. Mean (±SD) home-range size from minimum convex polygons was 84 (±48 ha) and ranged from 35 to 201 ha. Canada Jays strongly preferred forest–wetland edges, showed a weak preference for coniferous forests, a corresponding weak avoidance of shade-tolerant hardwood forests, and used mixed forest and wetlands in proportion to their availability. Our results suggest that, while adult Canada Jays use multiple types of habitat during the post-breeding period, they also key into forest–wetland edges, likely to take advantage of emergent prey while remaining near forested areas to maximize protection from predators. </jats:p>

TI  - The climate, the fuel and the land use: long-term regional variability of biomass burning in boreal forests
PY  - 2018
AB  - The influence of different drivers on changes in North American and European boreal forests biomass burning (BB) during the Holocene was investigated based on the following hypotheses: land use was important only in the southernmost regions, while elsewhere climate was the main driver modulated by changes in fuel type. BB was reconstructed by means of 88 sedimentary charcoal records divided into six different site clusters. A statistical approach was used to explore the relative contribution of (a) pollen-based mean July/summer temperature and mean annual precipitation reconstructions, (b) an independent model-based scenario of past land use (LU), and (c) pollen-based reconstructions of plant functional types (PFTs) on BB. Our hypotheses were tested with: (a) a west-east northern boreal sector with changing climatic conditions and a homogeneous vegetation, and (b) a north-south European boreal sector characterized by gradual variation in both climate and vegetation composition. The processes driving BB in boreal forests varied from one region to another during the Holocene. However, general trends in boreal biomass burning were primarily controlled by changes in climate (mean annual precipitation in Alaska, northern Quebec, and northern Fennoscandia, and mean July/summer temperature in central Canada and central Fennoscandia) and, secondarily, by fuel composition (BB positively correlated with the presence of boreal needleleaf evergreen trees in Alaska and in central and southern Fennoscandia). Land use played only a marginal role. A modification towards less flammable tree species (by promoting deciduous stands over fire-prone conifers) could contribute to reduce circumboreal wildfire risk in future warmer periods.

TI  - Investigation on Farmland Abandonment of Terraced Slopes Using Multitemporal Data Sources Comparison and Its Implication on Hydro-Geomorphological Processes
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper presents a quantitative multi-temporal analysis performed in a GIS environment and based on different spatial information sources. The research is aimed at investigating the land use transformations that occurred in a small coastal terraced basin of Eastern Liguria from the early 1950s to 2011. The degree of abandonment of cultivated terraced slopes together with its influence on the distribution, abundance, and magnitude of rainfall-induced shallow landslides were accurately analysed. The analysis showed that a large portion of terraced area (77.4%) has been abandoned over approximately sixty years. This land use transformation has played a crucial role in influencing the hydro-geomorphological processes triggered by a very intense rainstorm that occurred in 2011. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that terraces abandoned for a short time showed the highest landslide susceptibility and that slope failures affecting cultivated zones were characterized by a lower magnitude than those which occurred on abandoned terraced slopes. Furthermore, this study highlights the usefulness of cadastral data in understanding the impact of rainfall-induced landslides due to both a high spatial and thematic accuracy. The obtained results represent a solid basis for the investigation of erosion and the shallow landslide susceptibility of terraced slopes by means of a simulation of land use change scenarios.

TI  - Regional Management of Farmland Feeding Geese Using an Ecological Prioritization Tool
PY  - 2014
AB  - Wild geese foraging on farmland cause increasing conflicts with agricultural interests, calling for a strategic approach to mitigation. In central Norway, conflicts between farmers and spring-staging pink-footed geese feeding on pastures have escalated. To alleviate the conflict, a scheme by which farmers are subsidized to allow geese to forage undisturbed was introduced. To guide allocation of subsidies, an ecological-based ranking of fields at a regional level was recommended and applied. Here we evaluate the scheme. On average, 40 % of subsidized fields were in the top 5 % of the ranking, and 80 % were within the top 20 %. Goose grazing pressure on subsidized pastures was 13 times higher compared to a stratified random selection of non-subsidized pastures, capturing 67 % of the pasture feeding geese despite that subsidized fields only comprised 13 % of the grassland area. Close dialogue between scientists and managers is regarded as a key to the success of the scheme.

TI  - Using questionnaire surveys and occupancy modelling to identify conservation priorities for the Critically Endangered Balkan lynx Lynx lynx balcanicus
PY  - 2018
AB  - With an estimated < 50 adult individuals remaining, the Critically Endangered Balkan lynx Lynx lynx balcanicus is one of the rarest, most threatened and least-studied large carnivores. To identify priority conservation areas and actions for the subspecies, during 2006–2014 we conducted 1,374 questionnaire surveys throughout the potential range of the Balkan lynx to (1) evaluate human–lynx interactions and identify potential threats, and (2) determine the probability of site use in 207 grid cells through occupancy modelling. Human–lynx interactions were related mainly to poaching of lynx, and damage to livestock by lynx. Poaching was intense throughout the potential range of the subspecies, apparently having affected 50–100% of the total estimated extant population. Damage to livestock was recorded only in relation to sheep, mainly in the southern part of the lynx's potential range. Occupancy modelling indicated 108 grid cells with high probability of site use, which was affected mainly by increased terrain ruggedness and reduced forest cover. Based on the combined results of our study we identified five priority areas for conservation, as well as in situ habitat protection, community participation in the conservation of the subspecies, and the improvement and implementation of the existing legal framework as the priority conservation actions for the Balkan lynx.

TI  - Ecological Discomforts and How to Study Them
PY  - 2019
AB  - After many centuries of striving towards the separation from wildness, as a culture we are unprepared to confront the task of coexistence with wildlife. The difficulties we face range from material damages, through emotional strain and symbolic transgressions, through to unsettling of the established traditions. Wildlife management has been commonly used to address these difficulties. However, management is not a value-neutral practice, and, consequently, it always follows certain normative assumptions about how the human-animal relations should be organized. It is environmental and animal ethics that provide the necessary reflection on how coexistence should look like. While much work has been carried out by these two disciplines, they are rather reluctant to analyze constructively the ethical potential of antagonistic relations between humans and animals, often defining the perception of animals as threatening as ‘ecophobic’. This is a too quick dismissal of a very significant domain of human experience. Therefore, a program for a hermeneutic study of moral aspects of human experiences of ecological discomforts is proposed. Such an investigation has a potential to unearth meanings of threatening nature that can be used constructively to develop an ethics for coexistence with wildlife.

TI  - Implementation of the first adaptive management plan for a European migratory waterbird population: The case of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus
PY  - 2017
AB  - An International Species Management Plan for the Svalbard population of the pink-footed goose was adopted under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds in 2012, the first case of adaptive management of a migratory waterbird population in Europe. An international working group (including statutory agencies, NGO representatives and experts) agreed on objectives and actions to maintain the population in favourable conservation status, while accounting for biodiversity, economic and recreational interests. Agreements include setting a population target to reduce agricultural conflicts and avoid tundra degradation, and using hunting in some range states to maintain stable population size. As part of the adaptive management procedures, adjustment to harvest is made annually subject to population status. This has required streamlining of monitoring and assessment activities. Three years after implementation, indicators suggest the attainment of management results. Dialogue, consensus-building and engagement among stakeholders represent the major process achievements.

TI  - A landscape of coexistence for a large predator in a human dominated landscape
PY  - 2017
AB  - Human related mortality is a major threat for large carnivores all over the world and there is increasing evidence that large predators respond to human related risks in a similar way as prey respond to predation risk. This insight recently led to the conceptual development of a landscape of coexistence that can be used to identify areas which can sustain large predator populations in human dominated landscapes. In this study we applied the landscape of coexistence concept to a large predator in Europe. We investigated to what extent Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx habitat selection is affected by human disturbance in a human dominated landscape. More specifically, we were interested in the existence of a tradeoff between the availability of roe deer, one of their main prey and avoidance of human disturbance and how this affects the spatio-temporal space use patterns of lynx. We found that lynx face a tradeoff between high prey availability and avoidance of human disturbance and that they respond to this by using areas of high prey availability (but also high human disturbance) during the night when human activity is low. Furthermore our analysis showed that lynx increase their travelling speed and remain more in cover when they are close to areas of high human disturbance. Despite clear behavioral adjustments in response to human presence, prey availability still proved to be the most important predictor of lynx occurrence at small spatial scale, whereas human disturbance was considerably less important. The results of our study demonstrate how spatio-temporal adaptations in habitat selection enable large carnivores to persist in human dominated landscapes and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of a landscape of coexistence to develop adaptive management plans for endangered populations of large carnivores.

TI  - Long-term changes in habitat selection and prey spectrum in a reintroduced Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) population in Switzerland.
PY  - 2022
AB  - When wild-caught Eurasian lynx (<i>Lynx lynx</i>) from the Slovak Carpathian Mountains were reintroduced to Central Switzerland in the early 1970s and spread through the north-western Swiss Alps (NWA), they faced a largely unfamiliar landscape with strongly fragmented forests, high elevations, and intense human land use. For more than 30 years, radio-collared lynx have been monitored during three different project periods (in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s). Our study explored, how lynx over generations have learned to adjust to the alpine environment. We predicted that (1) lynx nowadays select more strongly for open habitats, higher elevations, and steep slopes compared to the early stages of recolonization and that (2) consequently, there were significant changes in the Eurasian lynx' prey spectrum. To test our predictions, we analyzed telemetry data (VHF, GPS) of 13 adult resident lynx in the NWA over 35 years, using Resource Selection Functions. Furthermore, we compared kills recorded from different individuals inhabiting the same region during three project periods. In general, lynx preferred forested areas, but over the years, they avoided open habitat less. Compared to the early stage of the recolonization, lynx in the most recent project period selected for higher elevations and the proportion of chamois in their prey spectrum surmounted that of roe deer. Potential driving factors for the observed changes could be increasing tolerance to human presence, intraspecific competition, or fitness benefits through exploitation of new resources. Long-term studies like ours provide important insight into how animals can respond to sudden environmental changes, e.g., in the course of translocations into new areas or anthropogenic alterations of their habitats.

TI  - Evaluating habitat suitability and connectivity for a recolonizing large carnivore
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The conservation of wide-ranging species presents challenges in a world of intensified human land use, forcing animals to occupy and recolonize human-modified landscapes. Although identifying suitable habitat and ensuring connectivity are important in supporting natural recolonization, these actions are rarely validated due to difficulties in monitoring such events. In Sweden, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is now recolonizing its former range, after centuries of persecution. We investigated resource selection based on telemetry data from 108 lynx monitored over 20 years. We assessed the differences between the established population in central Sweden and the recolonizing population in southern Sweden, and between established and dispersing individuals. We found that models based on central Sweden successfully identified core habitat patches for establishment in southern Sweden, validated after recolonization. We also found that lynx selected for higher habitat suitability during the recolonization phase, and that dispersing individuals were less selective than established lynx. Using cost-distance analysis, we assessed connectivity between central and southern Sweden, and found that landscape permeability was higher when based on dispersing lynx compared to established lynx. Altogether, our findings suggest that when landscapes are sufficiently similar between source and recolonization areas, resource selection information from an established population can be useful for managers seeking to facilitate recolonization of wide-ranging species. We recommend more frequent use of validation during and after recolonization events, to improve our common understanding of habitat suitability and connectivity modeling, and therefore to enable more active management of recolonization events.

TI  - Do historical maps show the maximal anthropopressure in the Carpathians
PY  - 2021
AB  - Many landscapes bear the marks of historical land use. These marks can be the basis for a reconstruction of a historical land use structure as some of them are typical of different types of human activity. The aim of this paper is to determine whether Austrian cadastral maps from the 19th century present the image of the most transformed environment in the Western Carpathians as a result of agricultural activity. Land use structure and terrain forms were detected based on Austrian cadastral maps from 1848, airborne laser scanning and field studies. In two of the test areas, the percentage of arable fields was higher among the plots with stone mounds than the percentage among the plots without them. In the third test area, the relationship was reversed. Also, lynchets, terraces and stone walls sometimes occur in plots that were not arable fields in 1848. Thus, the Austrian cadastral maps from 1848 could not reflect the maximal range of arable fields in the Carpathians in the 19th century. However, it is impossible to determine the historical structure of land use precisely. Nevertheless, an inventory of terrain forms can be used to assess land use when historical maps have not preserved or when available maps do not present land use in detail.

AB  - Recreational use of nature areas is increasing worldwide. All trail-based activities have a certain degradation effect on vegetation and soil, and conflicts between conservation values and recreation may occur. Controversy still exists regarding the relative impact of mountain bikers compared to hikers on trails. In this study, we manipulated the use intensity from hikers and mountain bikers on existing, natural-surfaced trails, and investigated effects of increased use and the relative importance of mountain biking on trail degradation. In two study sites, two trails were selected, one designated for hiking and one for biking. Passes were counted with TRAFx counters. The proportion of mountain bikers on the designated biking trails was on average 47%, and on the hiking trails 13%. Trail width and depth were recorded at permanently marked transects repeatedly throughout the growing season, and analyzed with linear mixed models as a function of number of passes, proportion of bikers and environmental conditions along the trail. Trail width, both the core trail without vegetation and the total area influenced by trampling and biking, showed on average small, but highly variable increases with enhanced use. Trail widening occurred particularly in moist parts, and trail width increased more when a larger proportion of the passes was mountain bikers. Trail depth did not change much throughout the study period, suggesting that the soils along the trails were already compacted and to a limited degree prone to soil movement and subsequent soil loss. Our study shows that on-trail use by hikers and mountain bikers have relatively limited overall effects in terms of trail widening and deepening, but that effects depend highly on environmental conditions; enhanced use of trails in wet areas is likely to result in greater trail degradation, and more so if a large proportion of the users are mountain bikers. Management and maintenance of trails, in terms of re-routing or trail surface hardening, could thus be necessary to avoid negative impacts of increased use. For such management actions to be successful, they need to be targeted towards the actual user groups and the natural conditions in the area.

TI  - The shrinking resource base of pastoralism: Saami reindeer husbandry in a climate of change
PY  - 2021
AB  - The productive performance of large ungulates in extensive pastoral grazing systems is modulated simultaneously by the effects of climate change and human intervention independent of climate change. The latter includes the expansion of private, civil and military activity and infrastructure and the erosion of land rights. We used Saami reindeer husbandry in Norway as a model in which to examine trends in, and to compare the influence of, both effects on a pastoral grazing system. Downscaled projections of mean annual temperature over the principal winter pasture area (Finnmarksvidda) closely matched empirical observations across 34 years to 2018. The area, therefore, is not only warming but seems likely to continue to warmdo so. Warming notwithstanding, 50Fifty-year (1969-2018) records of local weather (temperature, precipitation and characteristics of the snowpack) nevertheless demonstrate considerable annual and decadal variation which also seems likely to continue and alternately to amplify and to counter net warming. Warming, moreover, has both positive and negative effects on ecosystem services that influence reindeer. The effects of climate change on reindeer pastoralism are evidently neither temporally nor spatially uniform, nor indeed is the role of climate change as a driver of change in pastoralism even clear. The effects of human intervention on the system, by contrast, are clear and largely negative. Gradual liberalisation of grazing rights from the 18th Century has been countered by extensive loss of reindeer pasture. Access to approximately 50% of traditional winter pasture was lost in the last19th century owing to the closure of international borders to the passage of herders and their reindeer. At the same timeSubsequent this the area of undisturbed pasture within Norway has decreased by 71%. Loss of pasture from piecemeal development of infrastructure and administrative encroachment that erodes herders’ freedom of action on the land that remains to them are the principal threats to reindeer husbandry in Norway today. These tangible effects far exceed the putative effects of current climate change on the system. The situation confronting Saami reindeer pastoralism is not unique: loss of pasture and administrative, economic, legal and social constraints bedevil extensive pastoral grazing systems across the globe.

TI  - How reliable is my historical land-use reconstruction? Assessing uncertainties in old cadastral maps
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Old maps are a fundamental source for land-use reconstruction frequently used in biodiversity conservation and environmental management. In particular, cadastral maps as one type of old maps, depict both land tenure (discrete category) and land-use (continuous category); thus resulting in uncertainties in determination of individual parcels and their use. These uncertainties pose fundamental questions that are addressed in this paper: (i) to what extent land-use determined the delimitation of parcels?; (ii) how significant did the contrast between two land-use classes have to be to in order to delineate a new boundary? Agroforestry land-use classes were chosen as an example to demonstrate the approaches in the delimitation of parcels among different land-use combinations. We used Franciscan Cadastre, created in the mid-19th century under the Habsburg Monarchy (Central Europe), which depicts up to 10 agroforestry classes, to analyse factors that could influence delimitation of borders between patches (parcels) in old cadastral maps. The study area was located in the rural landscape of N Czechia, where approximately 10% of the agroforestry land area was used. We based our analysis on a detailed database of parcels and their land use type and property information. The novel approach to patch contrast indicator for old map analyses is introduced. The approach is based on statistical testing of the differences between parcel boundaries, separating similar/different owner, similar/different land-use and considering the length of the boundaries. Total number of identified parcels for all districts was 4108. Half of the boundaries length and 60% of boundaries count separated land of different owners. The rest of them separated land of one owner with different owner or with distinct parcels geometry. Our results indicate variable contrast between pairs of neighbouring land use categories. In particular, the contrast between pastures, wood-pastures and forests proved to be very low. Various factors, including land ownership, land-use, as well as landscape patch geometry and configuration were important to delineate a single parcel. We have concluded that these factors have important implications on inaccuracies and uncertainties of land use reconstructions based on old cadastral maps and used as historical baselines for current considerations on land change and environmental management.

TI  - Springtime grazing by Arctic-breeding geese reduces first- and second-harvest yields on sub-Arctic agricultural grasslands.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Large population increases of Arctic-breeding waterfowls over recent decades have intensified the conflict with agricultural interests in both Eurasia and North America. In the spring-staging region Vesteralen in sub-Arctic Norway, sheep, dairy and meat farmers have reported reduced agricultural grassland yields due to pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis that rest and forage in the region for 3-4 weeks in spring on their way to their breeding grounds on Svalbard. Here, we report from an experimental exclosure design where goose access to plots at three grassland fields in Vesteralen was prevented. The experiment was conducted over 3 years between 2012 and 2014. Goose abundance varied greatly between fields and years as a function of variable spring weather and forage quantity, facilitating evaluation of longer-term impacts under contrasting grazing intensities. First and second harvest yields across fields and years were 20% and 19% higher in exclosures than in plots open for grazing, while total yields (sum of first and second harvests) were on average 27% higher. Within-year effects on harvest yields varied substantially, primarily due to highly contrasting sward development during the spring-staging periods. Cool weather (2012) led to slow sward development and little or no effects on harvest yields, warmer weather (2013) resulted in generally large effects, while variable weather (2014) led to treatment effects varying across fields, with one field experiencing 61% higher yields in exclosures while there were no significant impacts on first-harvest yields at the two other fields. Goose grazing did not increase dry weight-based proportions of weeds. Overall, the farmers' reports on yield-loss due to goose grazing were confirmed, although impacts varied substantially between years. A novel finding is that second-harvest yields were also reduced. For the most affected farmers, it is unlikely that the current subsidy scheme is sufficient to cover all the their losses.

TI  - Saproxylic insects. Diversity, ecology and conservation - Importance of Primary Forests for the Conservation of Saproxylic Insects
PY  - 2018
AB  - Primary forests represent the ultimate intact habitat for saproxylic insects. However, their extent has been considerably reduced over the past centuries, and those remaining are very heterogeneously distributed. Primary forests are still locally abundant in tropical and boreal zones but are rare in temperate zones. Consequently, many saproxylic insects that were adapted to typical characteristics of primary forests, such as large amounts of dead wood or overmature and senescent trees, might have become extinct regionally due to habitat loss. The remaining primary forests therefore function as refuges for those saproxylic species that cannot survive in managed forests because of their high ecological requirements. Here we identify six characteristics of primary forests important for saproxylic insects that differentiate these forests greatly from managed forests, namely, absence of habitat fragmentation, continuity, natural disturbance regimes, dead-wood amount and quality, tree species composition and habitat trees. These six characteristics highlight the importance of primary forests for the conservation of saproxylic insects in all three main climatic domains (tropical, boreal and temperate). As primary forests are rare in northern temperate zones and are being dramatically lost in boreal and tropical zones, we propose that they should be strictly conserved independently of their climatic zone. Furthermore, we recommend that studies in primary forests intensify to provide reference data for integrating primary forest characteristics into managed forests to improve the conservation of saproxylic species.

TI  - Multi-century reconstruction suggests complex interactions of climate and human controls of forest fire activity in a Karelian boreal landscape, North-West Russia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Spatially explicit reconstructions of fire activity in European boreal forest are rare, which limits our understanding of factors driving vegetation dynamics in this part of the boreal domain. We have developed a spatially explicit dendrochronological reconstruction of a fire regime in a 25 × 50 km2 area within boreal biome located within the Kalevalsky National Park (Kalevalsky NP), over the 1400–2010 CE period. We dated 184 fire years using 212 fire-scarred living and dead Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees collected on 38 sites. The studied period revealed a pronounced century-long variability in forest fire cycles (FC). The early period (1400–1620 CE) had low fire activity (FC = 178 years), which increased during the 1630–1920 period (FC = 46 years) and then decreased over the 1930–2000 period (FC = 283 years). Dendrochronological results did not provide a conclusive answer on the origins of FC dynamics, although several lines of evidence suggest that climate drove the increase in fire activity in the early 1600s, while human-related factors were largely responsible for its decline in the early 1900s. The current FC in the Kalevalsky NP is close to the estimates reported for the pre-industrial colonisation period in Scandinavia, which suggests that the forests of the area currently maintain their close-to-natural fire regime. Fire has been the pivotal factor of forest dynamics in this biome and forest management should acknowledge that fact in developing conservation strategies in Karelia and other areas of European boreal forest. Introduction of prescribed burns of varying severity could be an important element of such strategies.

TI  - Combining multiple data sources in species distribution models while accounting for spatial dependence and overfitting with combined penalized likelihood maximization
PY  - 2019
AB  - Summary The increase in availability of species data sets means that approaches to species distribution modelling that incorporate multiple data sets are in greater demand. Recent methodological developments in this area have led to combined likelihood approaches, in which a log-likelihood comprised of the sum of the log-likelihood components of each data source is maximised. Often, these approaches make use of at least one presence-only data set and use the log-likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model in the combined likelihood construction. While these advancements have been shown to improve predictive performance, they do not currently address challenges in presence-only modelling such as checking and correcting for violations of the independence assumption of a Poisson point process model or more general challenges in species distribution modelling such as overfitting. In this paper, we present an extension of the combined likelihood framework which accommodates alternative presence-only likelihoods in the presence of spatial dependence as well as lasso-type penalties to account for potential overfitting. We compare the proposed approach combined penalised likelihood approach to the standard combined likelihood approach via simulation and apply the method to modelling the distribution of the Eurasian lynx in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The simulations show that the proposed combined penalised likelihood approach outperforms the standard approach when spatial dependence is present in the data. The lynx analysis shows that the predicted maps vary significantly with the different implementations of the proposed approach. This work highlights the benefits of careful consideration of the presence-only components of the combined likelihood formulation, and allows greater flexibility and ability to accommodate real datasets.

TI  - Development of a large-scale juvenile density model to inform the assessment and management of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in Scotland
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Electrofishing data are commonly collected to assess the status of salmonid populations. However, their interpretation can be challenging without a benchmark measure of abundance against which they can be compared, leading some practitioners to question the value of these data. Juvenile density models that relate salmonid abundance to habitat characteristics offer one approach for developing spatially explicit benchmark abundances. This study collated and analysed an electrofishing dataset for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) collected across Scotland between 1997 and 2015. Habitat was characterised using landscape proxies, derived from large scale spatial datasets. A two stage modelling approach related (1) capture probability to landscape and other covariates (2) fish density to landscape and other covariates, having adjusted for differences in capture probability. Capture probability varied with monitoring organisation, year and region, responded modally to day of the year, and decreased with upstream catchment area, river distance to sea and gradient. Salmon density increased non-linearly with upstream catchment area and river distance to sea and decreased with the percentage of the riparian zone containing conifer trees. There was a south-north gradient in density, with higher densities in the north. The density model was used to develop benchmark salmon densities (reference conditions) that would be expected in river catchments that are relatively un-impacted by anthropogenic pressures and are associated with high spawner densities, resulting in near-saturation of available freshwater habitat. The benchmark densities were based on the fixed effects from the density model, excluding the effects of riparian conifer woodland and the south-north gradient, adjusted for the site-wise mean observed density in the dataset. Comparing catchment scale predictions of juvenile production against this benchmark (or some percentage of it) could provide a valuable assessment tool.

TI  - Identifying and correcting spatial bias in opportunistic citizen science data for wild ungulates in Norway.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Many publications make use of opportunistic data, such as citizen science observation data, to infer large-scale properties of species' distributions. However, the few publications that use opportunistic citizen science data to study animal ecology at a habitat level do so without accounting for spatial biases in opportunistic records or using methods that are difficult to generalize. In this study, we explore the biases that exist in opportunistic observations and suggest an approach to correct for them. We first examined the extent of the biases in opportunistic citizen science observations of three wild ungulate species in Norway by comparing them to data from GPS telemetry. We then quantified the extent of the biases by specifying a model of the biases. From the bias model, we sampled available locations within the species' home range. Along with opportunistic observations, we used the corrected availability locations to estimate a resource selection function (RSF). We tested this method with simulations and empirical datasets for the three species. We compared the results of our correction method to RSFs obtained using opportunistic observations without correction and to RSFs using GPS-telemetry data. Finally, we compared habitat suitability maps obtained using each of these models. Opportunistic observations are more affected by human access and visibility than locations derived from GPS telemetry. This has consequences for drawing inferences about species' ecology. Models naively using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies can result in spurious inferences. However, sampling availability locations based on the spatial biases in opportunistic data improves the estimation of the species' RSFs and predicted habitat suitability maps in some cases. This study highlights the challenges and opportunities of using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies. While our method is not foolproof it is a first step toward unlocking the potential of opportunistic citizen science data for habitat-use studies.

TI  - Post-fire restoration of tree species in various soil conditions after surface fires zone
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The study of forest regeneration in stands exposed to fire has both fundamental and applied relevance. The objects of the study were the exposed to surface fires forest plots of various soil and hydrological conditions in the north-east of the Leningrad Region in the landscape of the Tikhvin ridge of the north-eastern part of the Valdai Hills. To study the natural renewal of tree species, circular plots of 10 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> were created along a transect traced over a diagonal of the area exposed to fire. Post-fire impact on soils with different particle size distribution causes the formation of stands with different shares of coniferous and broad-leaf species. After the exposure of tree communities to fire, regeneration processes can follow different directions in the formation of the future planting composition, and that depends on soil and hydrological conditions. Knowing the succession status of the post-fire plant community, further silvicultural measures can be planned for the management of stand composition.</jats:p>

TI  - Intensity of space use reveals conditional sex-specific effects of prey and conspecific density on home range size.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Home range (HR) size variation is often linked to resource abundance, with sex differences expected to relate to sex-specific fitness consequences. However, studies generally fail to disentangle the effects of the two main drivers of HR size variation, food and conspecific density, and rarely consider how their relative influence change over spatiotemporal scales. We used location data from 77 Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from a 16-year Scandinavian study to examine HR sizes variation relative to prey and conspecific density at different spatiotemporal scales. By varying the isopleth parameter (intensity of use) defining the HR, we show that sex-specific effects were conditional on the spatial scale considered. Males had larger HRs than females in all seasons. Females' total HR size declined as prey and conspecific density increased, whereas males' total HR was only affected by conspecific density. However, as the intensity of use within the HR increased (from 90% to 50% isopleth), the relationship between prey density and area showed opposing patterns for females and males; for females, the prey density effect was reduced, while for males, prey became increasingly important. Thus, prey influenced the size of key regions within male HRs, despite total HR size being independent of prey density. Males reduced their HR size during the mating season, likely to remain close to individual females in estrous. Females reduced their HR size postreproduction probably because of movement constrains imposed by dependent young. Our findings highlight the importance of simultaneously considering resources and intraspecific interactions as HR size determinants. We show that sex-specific demands influence the importance of prey and conspecific density on space use at different spatiotemporal scales. Thus, unless a gradient of space use intensity is examined, factors not related to total HR size might be disregarded despite their importance in determining size of key regions within the HR.

TI  - Changes in non-forest woody vegetation in the south-western part of the White Carpathians (1949–2011)
PY  - 2015
AB  - <jats:p>Non-forest woody vegetation is an important part of the landscape structure and a determining feature of the landscape character. The present study investigates changes in the area covered by non-forest woody vegetation in the landscape of the south-western part of the White Carpathians (western Slovakia) over the course of the last 60 years. The study is based on a comparison of landscape metrics interpreted from aerial photographs taken in 1949, 1986 and 2006. Relations of non-forest woody vegetation to environmental conditions and its present state (qualitative characteristics) mapped in the field are discussed as well. Results confirm a close relationship between the distribution of non-forest woody vegetation and environmental conditions such as elevation, slope, partially also with soil and landscape type. In terms of landscape structure changes, the number of patches as well as the total area of non-forest woody vegetation rapidly decreased due to intensification of agriculture, while extensification recorded during the first observed period, as well continuing extensification, landscape abandonment and social changes throughout the second period also partially contribute to this trend.</jats:p>

TI  - From simple metrics to cervid forage: Improving predictions of ericaceous shrub biomass
PY  - 2023
AB  - Common understory vegetation species such as the ericaceous shrubs bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris), are key forage plant species for moose and other large herbivores, as well as fulfilling many additional ecosystem functions and services. Here we developed models to predict above-ground biomass of these ericaceous species in coniferous forests, using data on their percentage cover, height, and different stand characteristics. We also built models to understand how the aforementioned variables affect the proportion of the shrubs commonly utilized as forage by large herbivores. We found that the percentage cover of shrubs was the most important explanatory variable when predicting above-ground biomass, explaining 51%, 47% and 71% of the variation (marginal R2) in bilberry, cowberry and heather biomass, respectively. By adding ramet height to the model with percentage cover, the variation explained increased to 77% for bilberry, 75% for cowberry and 87% for heather. The best outcome for candidate models was obtained by adding stand site index and spruce basal area to the model, improving the variation explained in bilberry to 83%, to 81% for cowberry, and 91% for heather. When modelling the proportion of the shrubs commonly utilized as forage by large herbivores, stand site index and spruce basal area often played important roles. Some of the best fitting models for forage biomass explained 51% of the variation in bilberry, 59% in cowberry and 30% in heather. Site location did not have a major role in improving the variability explained in either type of model, which indicated the applicability of the models regardless of study location. Our models therefore have a high potential to be implemented in forestry decision support systems. Their inclusion should provide better large-scale estimations of forage resources, aiding forest management, and thereby taking an important step forward to determine the ecosystem carrying capacity of large herbivores.

TI  - Proposed solutions to anthropogenic climate change: A systematic literature review and a new way forward.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Humanity is now facing what may be the biggest challenge to its existence: irreversible climate change brought about by human activity. Our planet is in a state of emergency, and we only have a short window of time (7-8 years) to enact meaningful change. The goal of this systematic literature review is to summarize the peer-reviewed literature on proposed solutions to climate change in the last 20 years (2002-2022), and to propose a framework for a unified approach to solving this climate change crisis. Solutions reviewed include a transition toward use of renewable energy resources, reduced energy consumption, rethinking the global transport sector, and nature-based solutions. This review highlights one of the most important but overlooked pieces in the puzzle of solving the climate change problem - the gradual shift to a plant-based diet and global phaseout of factory (industrialized animal) farming, the most damaging and prolific form of animal agriculture. The gradual global phaseout of industrialized animal farming can be achieved by increasingly replacing animal meat and other animal products with plant-based products, ending government subsidies for animal-based meat, dairy, and eggs, and initiating taxes on such products. Failure to act will ultimately result in a scenario of irreversible climate change with widespread famine and disease, global devastation, climate refugees, and warfare. We therefore suggest an "All Life" approach, invoking the interconnectedness of all life forms on our planet. The logistics for achieving this include a global standardization of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) or similar measures and the introduction of a regulatory body for verification of such measures. These approaches will help deliver environmental and sustainability benefits for our planet far beyond an immediate reduction in global warming.

TI  - Post-fire Recruitment Failure as a Driver of Forest to Non-forest Ecosystem Shifts in Boreal Regions.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Climate change and land-use are driving large changes in forest ecosystems around the globe. In the boreal biome it is likely that increases in temperature and the associated lengthening of the growing season will cause the forest to expand into the northern tundra and upwards in elevation, whilst potentially contracting at its southern limits. This increase in temperature is also driving an increase in the frequency and severity of boreal forest fires. A growing number of studies have observed the failure of forest species to re-establish after a stand-replacing fire event, which results in the shift to a non-forested ecosystem. In this chapter, this process is referred to as post-fire recruitment failure. We provide multiple lines of evidence for boreal forests, and more specifically for southern Siberia forests, that a possible regional tipping point is unfolding, which could lead to the rapid replacement of large areas of forest ecosystems with low-stature non-forest ecosystems. This change would come with significant consequences for the carbon balance, surface albedo and the resulting altered energy balance.

TI  - Cumulative effects of infrastructure and human disturbance: a case study with reindeer
PY  - 2021
AB  - Within Rangifer ranges, many studies focus on expanding infrastructure and human activity negatively influencing habitat use. Little documentation exists on how disturbances act in synergy (i.e. cumulative effects), nor methods to test such effects. (1) Investigate how cumulative disturbance at different distances affects reindeer habitat use and (2) at what disturbance levels and distances loss of habitat functionality occurs. Disturbance intensity levels for trails and infrastructure were based on expected amount of human activity, on a scale from 1 to 6. To test cumulative disturbance, we adapted the multi-grain method and summed-up disturbance intensity levels within “disturbance distance intervals” (0–0.25, 0.25–1, 1–2 km, etc. instead of 0–0.25, 0–1, 0–2 km, etc.), and tested reindeers’ avoidance using GPS data for 2011–2018. We found decreased habitat use within 0.25 km with increasing cumulative disturbance for snow free and winter seasons. For spring, a similar effect occurred up to 1 km. Reductions in use in areas with highest cumulative disturbance within these zones were between 92 and 98%. Strongest avoidance during spring supports previous studies. Comparatively, the multi-grain approach showed negative effects up to 3 km. Our approach provides novel results and precisely estimates where cumulative effects actually occur. Reindeer in our study tolerate low intensities of human disturbance, while further increase in disturbance intensity reduces habitat functionality. We suggest clustering future human developments within areas of high disturbance, i.e. where functional habitat use is already lost or highly reduced. Our method can be used for other areas and species.

TI  - Scaring waterfowl as a management tool : how much more do geese forage after disturbance?
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary With increasing numbers of many herbivorous waterfowl species, often foraging on farmland, the conflict with agriculture has intensified. One popular management tool is to scare birds off the land, often in association with shooting. However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We used the white-fronted goose Anser albifrons, the most common (grass-eating) goose wintering in western Europe, as a model species. We measured flight durations by high-frequency accelerometer recordings over 2 × 24 h in nine focal geese that were only incidentally disturbed. We also made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances. On average, the geese flew daily 2 × 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m) and furthermore took to the air 5·3 times during a day (and 1·9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0·6 h day−1 and a total foraging time of 7·4 h day−1. The extra foraging time needed to compensate for additional intentional disturbances strongly depends on the frequency of such disturbances and the following flight duration. If, for example, flights when intentionally disturbed are twice as long (2 × 195 s), the extra foraging time will be 3·7% day−1 (2·3–3·2% day−1 in the more realistic model) for each intentional disturbance, and the geese will no longer be able to cover their energy requirements when intentionally disturbed six times per day. Synthesis and applications. Recent experiments suggest that geese have to be scared frequently in order to reduce goose visitation to particular fields. With an intentional disturbance rate, for example, of five times a day, the birds' compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11·5–16% day−1. Accommodation schemes have to take such increases in total grass consumption into account when deciding on the refuge areas to be set aside.

TI  - Discriminating between possible foraging decisions using pattern-oriented modelling: The case of pink-footed geese in Mid-Norway during their spring migration
PY  - 2016
AB  - Foraging decisions and their energetic consequences are critical to capital Arctic-breeders migrating in steps, because there is only a narrow time window with optimal foraging conditions at each step. Optimal foraging theory predicts that such animals should spend more time in patches that enable them to maximise the net rate of energy and nutrient gain. The type of search strategy employed by animals is, however, expected to depend on the amount of information that is involved in the search process. In highly dynamic landscapes, animals are unlikely to have complete knowledge about the distribution of the resources, which makes them unable to forage on the patches that enable them to maximise their net energy intake. Random search may, however, be a good strategy in landscapes where patches with profitable resources are abundant. We present simulation experiments using an individual-based model (IBM) to test which foraging decision rule (FDR) best reproduces the population patterns observed in pink-footed geese during spring staging in an agricultural landscape in Mid-Norway. Our results suggested that while geese employed a random search strategy, they were also able to individually learn where the most profitable patches were located and return to the patches that resulted in highest energy intake. Such asocial learning is rarely reported for flock animals. The modelled geese did not benefit from group foraging, which contradicts the results reported by most studies on flocking birds. Geese also did not possess complete knowledge about the profitability of the available habitat. Most likely, there is no one single optimal foraging strategy for capital breeders but such strategy is site and species-specific. We discussed the potential use of the model as a valuable tool for making future risk assessments of human disturbance and changes in agricultural practices.

TI  - Wolves under cover: The importance of human-related factors in resting site selection in a commercial forest
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We investigated winter selection of resting sites by wolves in a commercial pine forest to test if roads, settlements, and type of forest influenced the resting behaviour of wolves during the day and at night. At the landscape scale, wolves selected resting sites that were farther from settlements, public roads and high-traffic forest roads than random points. At the fine scale, wolves chose sites that were more concealed and farther from the closest forest road than random points. During the day, wolves tended to rest in thickets and forest with understorey, whereas at night they rested in more open habitats. The concealment of resting sites was higher when wolves rested closer to high-traffic forest roads and during the day. Our results indicate that certain forestry practices enhance concealment opportunities and might therefore be beneficial for wolves

TI  - Empirical characterization factors to be used in LCA and assessing the effects of hydropower on fish richness
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Hydropower is often presented as a clean, reliable, and renewable energy source, but is also recognized for its potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem biodiversity. We used direct empirical data of change in fish species richness following impoundment to develop ecological indicators to be used in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and accounting for hydropower impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Data were collected on 89 sampling stations (63 stations located upstream, and 26 located downstream of a dam) distributed in 26 reservoirs from three biomes (boreal, temperate and tropical). Overall, the impact of hydropower on fish species richness was significant in the tropics, of smaller amplitude in temperate biome and minimal in boreal biome, stressing the need for regionalisation when developing indicators. The impact of hydropower was consistent across scales for a given biome (same directionality and statistical significance across sampling stations and reservoirs). However, the indicators were sensitive to the duration of the study (the period over which data have been collected after impoundment), which can underestimate the impacts. This result highlights the need to account for the duration of the transient dynamics to reach a steady state (rate of change in species richness = 0) before developing ecological indicators. By using the LCA approach, our suggested indicators contribute to fill a major gap in assisting decision-makers when evaluating the potential of alternative energy technologies, such as hydropower, to decarbonize the worldwide economy, while minimizing the impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Conceptual and methodological advances in habitat-selection modeling: guidelines for ecology and evolution
PY  - 2021
AB  - Habitat selection is a fundamental animal behavior that shapes a wide range of ecological processes, including animal movement, nutrient transfer, trophic dynamics and population distribution. Although habitat selection has been a focus of ecological studies for decades, technological, conceptual and methodological advances over the last 20 yr have led to a surge in studies addressing this process. Despite the substantial literature focused on quantifying the habitat-selection patterns of animals, there is a marked lack of guidance on best analytical practices. The conceptual foundations of the most commonly applied modeling frameworks can be confusing even to those well versed in their application. Furthermore, there has yet to be a synthesis of the advances made over the last 20 yr. Therefore, there is a need for both synthesis of the current state of knowledge on habitat selection, and guidance for those seeking to study this process. Here, we provide an approachable overview and synthesis of the literature on habitat-selection analyses (HSAs) conducted using selection functions, which are by far the most applied modeling framework for understanding the habitat-selection process. This review is purposefully non-technical and focused on understanding without heavy mathematical and statistical notation, which can confuse many practitioners. We offer an overview and history of HSAs, describing the tortuous conceptual path to our current understanding. Through this overview, we also aim to address the areas of greatest confusion in the literature. We synthesize the literature outlining the most exciting conceptual advances in the field of habitat-selection modeling, discussing the substantial ecological and evolutionary inference that can be made using contemporary techniques. We aim for this paper to provide clarity for those navigating the complex literature on HSAs while acting as a reference and best practices guide for practitioners.

TI  - Interactions between outdoor recreation and iconic terrestrial vertebrates in two French alpine national parks
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Protected areas manage synergies and trade-offs associated with core missions of nature protection while supporting education, recreation and tourism. In this paper we demonstrate how spatial modelling co-produced with managers can support the assessment of interactions between two cultural services: outdoor recreation and iconic terrestrial vertebrates. In two French national parks (Ecrins and Vanoise) we showed clear seasonal differentiation in spatial patterns for potential iconic vertebrate diversity, recreation opportunities and their interactions. Our first hypothesis that limited access and mobility of recreationists during winter would increase potential wildlife refugia was largely validated for Ecrins. Our second hypothesis that lower but spatially diffuse pressure from recreationists in Ecrins would increase potential interference as compared to more intense but directed activity in Vanoise was consistent with patterns in summer. For winter the spatial concentration of recreation around ski resorts of Vanoise was highly impactful. Across both parks concerns about the expansion of winter activities are legitimate, especially for climate-sensitive species. We also showed the critical role of refuge areas in high valleys (summer) and lower slopes away from tracks (winter), highlighting threats from off-track practices. Beyond regulation our results will support dialogue with the public and professionals based on communication and education.

TI  - Consolations of Environmental Philosophy
PY  - 2021
AB  - Due to successful protection and restoration efforts, humans and wild animals more and more often come to inhabit overlapping spaces. This is often experienced by humans as problematic, as animals may cause material damages to property and pose threats to humans and domesticated animals. These threats, as well as normative beliefs about belonging and culturally-based prejudices, often provoke distress or aggression towards animals. While philosophy has so far provided normative guidance as to what we should do in terms of developing proper relationships, the actual tools designed to facilitate the development of more peaceful cohabitation have been provided mostly by wildlife management and social sciences. In this contribution, I propose that environmental philosophy can provide conceptual tools easing the difficulties of cohabitation. One such tool is the practice of consolation. I begin by drawing a distinction between the contemporary and traditional forms of consolation. I further show that several common ethical arguments concerning cohabitation with wildlife can be seen as following the ancient concept of consolation. I close with some practical remarks regarding how environmental consolation could be practiced today in the context of difficult cohabitation with wildlife.

TI  - Spatial dimensions in stated preference valuation: The role of place attachment
PY  - NA
AB  - The importance of considering spatial dimensions in welfare analysis is increasingly acknowledged, but there are still knowledge gaps. For this purpose, we turn to environmental psychology and use place attachment, the functional and emotional bond people have to a defined place. We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model. Place attachment may provide valuable information on the affected populations when evaluating land-use policies.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Functions: An Example of Meeting Competing National and International Obligations by Harnessing Regional Differences
PY  - 2020
AB  - The increased demand for bio based products worldwide provides an opportunity for Eastern European countries to increase their production in agriculture and forestry. At the same time, such economic development must be congruent with the European Union’s long-term climate and biodiversity objectives. As a country that is rich in bioresources, the Latvian case study is highly relevant to many other countries—especially those in Central and Eastern Europe—and faces a choice of transition pathways to meet both economic and environmental objectives. In order to assess the trade-offs between investments in the bioeconomy and the achievement of climate and biodiversity objectives, we used the Functional Land Management (FLM) framework for the quantification of the supply and demand for the primary productivity, carbon regulation and biodiversity functions. We related the supply of these three soil functions to combinations of land use and soil characteristics. The demand for the same functions were derived from European, national and regional policy objectives. Our results showed different spatial scales at which variation in demand and supply is manifested. High demand for biodiversity was associated with areas dominated by agricultural land at the local scale, while regional differences of unemployment rates and the target for GDP increases framed the demand for primary productivity. National demand for carbon regulation focused on areas dominated by forests on organic soils. We subsequently identified mismatches between the supply and demand for soil functions, and we selected spatial locations for specific land use changes and improvements in management practices to promote sustainable development of the bio-economy. Our results offer guidance to policy makers that will help them to form a national policy that will underpin management practices that are effective and tailored toward local climate conditions and national implementation pathways.

TI  - A new method to estimate habitat potential for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): predicting the influence of dam removal on the Sélune River (France) as a case study
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Maintaining connectivity in aquatic ecosystems is important to ensure adequate ecological functioning. A large dam removal project in the Sélune River (Normandy, France) would reconnect 827 km2 of catchment area to the sea. Only the downstream section of the Selune is currently available to diadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater and the marine environment. In particular, managers focus on the future potential abundance of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, for conservation and fishery purposes. As in stream channel habitat drives carrying capacity of juvenile salmon, salmon abundance is usually inferred from intensive and linear habitat surveys. However, this approach is neither cost-effective for large-scale surveys nor feasible for riverbed sections with low accessibility for measurement with traditional methods, e.g. dam lakes. We used well-defined relationships between gradient, hydrology and channel habitat structure to construct a simple model to estimate potential suitable habitat for juvenile salmon. Using fine-scale habitat data from nearby rivers, we parameterized a linear mixed model to estimate the area of suitable habitat based on simple physical descriptors of river characteristics. We compared our predictions to fine-scale habitat surveys on the upper Sélune. Using only slope and width, our model was able to explain 80% of the variance in suitable habitat. Estimates indicated that dam removal on the Sélune River would generate a threefold increase in suitable habitat for juveniles. This could increase the mean number of adult salmon returning to the river by 1420.9 (s.e. = 1015.5). More generally, this model provides an alternative and cost-effective tool to help better manage salmon populations in rivers impacted by dams.</jats:p>

TI  - Scaring as a tool to alleviate crop damage by geese: Revealing differences between farmers’ perceptions and the scale of the problem
PY  - 2017
AB  - Expanding populations of farmland foraging geese are causing escalating conflict with agriculture. We used questionnaires to investigate farmers´ perceptions in mid-Norway of spring staging geese and the extent to which they attempt to reduce pasture damage by goose scaring. We predicted farmers’ scaring effort (a measure of dissatisfaction) to increase on fields closer to goose roosting sites where goose grazing intensity was highest (measured by dropping counts). Results showed no such relationship, suggesting that farmers’ perception of goose use was not linked to actual goose use, but influenced by sociological factors and individual opinion. These results confirm the need to distribute subsidies/compensation to affected farmers based upon quantifiable measures of goose use rather than complaint levels. To avoid further conflict escalation, it is equally important that managers are aware of farmers´ perceptions and their causes, to effectively target communication about policies and measures to mitigate goose–agriculture problems.

TI  - Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between migratory geese and agriculture
PY  - 2018
AB  - 1. Many migratory goose populations have thrived over the past decades and their reliance on agricultural resources has often led to conflicts. Control and management measures are sought after but since migratory geese use several sites in their annual cycle, local management actions should consider their potential effects further down the flyway. 2. We used a behaviour‐based migration model to illustrate the consequences of management actions involving hunting, derogation shooting and scaring at single or multiple locations along the flyway, considering various mechanisms of how geese might perceive shooting/hunting. Furthermore, as a proxy for the agricultural damage caused, we calculated the per capita biomass consumption between scenarios—both over time and cumulatively. 3. We found that hunting, shooting and scaring can result in a suite of direct and indirect consequences on migration and foraging behaviour. Most importantly, hunting/shooting on a particular site had implications not only for the behaviour at the actual site but also for behaviour at, and use of, other sites. Furthermore, the specific consequences of shooting/hunting could be counter‐intuitive, that is, aggravate rather than alleviate agricultural damage, depending on where along the migration route changes had taken place and the mechanisms through which hunting/shooting was assumed to affect geese. 4. Synthesis and applications. Management plans are being discussed or implemented for several migratory goose populations and often include shooting, hunting or scaring at one or multiple locations. Using a behaviour‐based model, we assessed the consequences of such local management measures and found that they can indeed lead to a reduction of agricultural conflicts locally but may also aggravate the conflict or shift it to other sites along the flyway. Thus, we recommend the use of these models to scrutinize the efficiency of specific management measures and to assist in identifying an international management regime that minimizes conflicts on a flyway level while still maintaining migratory populations.

TI  - Regional Differentiation of Long-Term Land Use Changes: A Case Study of Czechia
PY  - 2019
AB  - The major topic of this article is the evaluation of the regional differentiation of the long-term changes in land use in Czechia. This study searches the spatial and temporal differentiation of the changes and their driving forces since the 19th century. The comprehensive land use land cover change database (LUCC Czechia Database) which comprises cadastral data on the land use in the years 1845, 1896, 1948, 1990, 2000, and 2010 for more than 8000 units, was the main data source. The chief benefit of this article can be seen in the methodical procedures of the application of the “Rate of heterogeneity” (H) derived from the Gini coefficient in the research of the differentiation/inequality of the long-term land use change. GIS modeling tools were used to calculate the selected geographical characteristics (altitude and slope) of the examined units for the purpose of searching the factors of the land use changes. The results show a strong trend in the differentiation of the long-term land use changes. Two main antagonistic processes took place in the land use structure during the observed period of 1845–2010. The fertile regions experienced agricultural intensification with the concentration of the arable land in these regions. On the other hand, the infertile regions experienced extensification, accompanied by afforestation and grass planting during the last decades. The influence of natural conditions (altitude and slope) on the distribution of the land use has been growing—the arable land has been concentrated into the lower altitudes and, more significantly, into less steep areas. Grasslands and forests predominantly occupy the less favored areas with higher altitudes and steeper slopes. The built-up areas have been strongly concentrated and regionally polarized. In 1845, half of the Czech built-up areas were concentrated in 31% of the total country area, whereas in 2010, it was in 21%.

TI  - Individual-area relationship best explains goose species density in wetlands
PY  - 2015
AB  - Explaining and predicting animal distributions is one of the fundamental objectives in ecology and conservation biology. Animal habitat selection can be regulated by top-down and bottom-up processes, and is mediated by species interactions. Species varying in body size respond differently to top-down and bottom-up determinants, and hence understanding these allometric responses to those determinants is important for conservation. In this study, using two differently sized goose species wintering in the Yangtze floodplain, we tested the predictions derived from three different hypotheses (individual-area relationship, food resource and disturbance hypothesis) to explain the spatial and temporal variation in densities of two goose species. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, we demonstrated that goose density was positive correlated with patch area size, suggesting that the individual area-relationship best predicts differences in goose densities. Moreover, the other predictions, related to food availability and disturbance, were not significant. Buffalo grazing probably facilitated greater white-fronted geese, as the number of buffalos was positively correlated to the density of this species. We concluded that patch area size is the most important factor determining the density of goose species in our study area. Patch area size is directly determined by water levels in the Yangtze floodplain, and hence modifying the hydrological regimes can enlarge the capacity of these wetlands for migratory birds.

TI  - Values, animal symbolism, and human-animal relationships associated to two threatened felids in Mapuche and Chilean local narratives
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: The Chilean temperate rainforest has been subjected to dramatic fragmentation for agriculture and forestry exploitation. Carnivore species are particularly affected by fragmentation and the resulting resource use conflicts with humans. This study aimed at understanding values and human-animal relationships with negatively perceived threatened carnivores through the disclosure of local stories and Mapuche traditional folktales. Methods: Our mixed approach comprised the qualitative analysis of 112 stories on the kodkod cat (Leopardus guigna) and the puma (Puma concolor) collected by students (9-14 years) from 28 schools in the Araucania region within their family contexts, 10 qualitative in-depth interviews with indigenous Mapuche people, 35 traditional Mapuche legends, and the significance of naming found in ethnographic collections. Results: We revealed a quasi-extinction of traditional tales in the current knowledge pool about pumas and kodkods, local anecdotes, however, were present in significant numbers. Values associated to both felids were manifold, ranging from negativistic to positive values. While pumas played an important role in people’s spirituality, negative mythological connotations persisted in kodkod stories. Four prominent relationships were derived: (1) Both felids represent threats to livestock, pumas even to life, (2) both felids are symbols for upcoming negative events, (3) pumas are spiritual creatures, and (4) kodkods are threatened by humans. Recommendations are provided for stimulating new ways of perceiving unpopular and threatened carnivores among those who live in vicinity to them.

TI  - Implications of the forage maturation hypothesis for activity of partially migratory male and female deer
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Partial migration is common in a large variety of taxa in seasonally variable environments. Understanding the mechanisms underlying migration is important, as migration affects individual fitness. Migratory herbivores benefit from delayed forage maturation and hence higher food quality during migration and at their summer range, termed the forage maturation hypothesis (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">FMH</jats:styled-content>). The link between diet quality and rumination time allows migrants eating a higher quality diet to spend less time on rumination, and they can thus allocate more time to additional feeding. However, such an argument implicitly assumes that deer are energy maximizers, while studies have reported also time minimization strategies under risk of predation. Male and female distributions are limited by different factors linked to both body size differences and reproductive strategies, but there is no study investigating differences in activity pattern according to the individual migratory patterns for male and female deer. We here unify the <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">FMH</jats:styled-content> with the hypotheses predicting sex‐specific time allocation strategies. To test predictions of sex‐specific activity of resident and migratory red deer (<jats:italic>Cervus elaphus</jats:italic>), we analyzed activity data of 286 individuals that were fitted with <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">GPS</jats:styled-content> collars from a population in western Norway. While migrants were more active during the migration itself, we found no differences in activity pattern between migrant and resident deer during the main growth season, neither in terms of proportion of daily time active nor in terms of daily mean movement speed, thus rejecting that deer were energy maximizers. Overall, we found that females were more active during the main growth season even after controlling for body size differences. These patterns are consistent with patterns predicted from sexual segregation theory linked to the reproductive strategy hypothesis. Our study highlights how the understanding of migration can be advanced by considering it in the context of different reproductive strategies of males and females.</jats:p>

TI  - An ontogenetic perspective on individual differences
PY  - 2015
AB  - Phenotypic differences among individuals can arise during any stage of life. Although several distinct processes underlying individual differences have been defined and studied (e.g. parental effects, senescence), we lack an explicit, unified perspective for understanding how these processes contribute separately and synergistically to observed variation in functional traits. We propose a conceptual framework based on a developmental view of life-history variation, linking each ontogenetic stage with the types of individual differences originating during that period. In our view, the salient differences among these types are encapsulated by three key criteria: timing of onset, when fitness consequences are realized, and potential for reversibility. To fill a critical gap in this framework, we formulate a new term to refer to individual differences generated during adulthood—reversible state effects. We define these as ‘reversible changes in a functional trait resulting from life-history trade-offs during adulthood that affect fitness’, highlighting how the adult phenotype can be repeatedly altered in response to environmental variation. Defining individual differences in terms of trade-offs allows explicit predictions regarding when and where fitness consequences should be expected. Moreover, viewing individual differences in a developmental context highlights how different processes can work in concert to shape phenotype and fitness, and lays a foundation for research linking individual differences to ecological and evolutionary theory.

TI  - The use of canid tooth marks on bone for the identification of livestock predation.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Historically wolves and humans have had a conflictive relationship which has driven the wolf to extinction in some areas across Northern America and Europe. The last decades have seen a rise of multiple government programs to protect wolf populations. Nevertheless, these programs have been controversial in rural areas, product of the predation of livestock by carnivores. As a response to such issues, governments have presented large scale economic plans to compensate the respected owners. The current issue lies in the lack of reliable techniques that can be used to detect the predator responsible for livestock predation. This has led to complications when obtaining subsidies, creating conflict between landowners and government officials. The objectives of this study therefore are to provide a new alternative approach to differentiating between tooth marks of different predators responsible for livestock predation. Here we present the use of geometric morphometrics and Machine Learning algorithms to discern between different carnivores through in depth analysis of the tooth marks they leave on bone. These results present high classification rates with up to 100% accuracy in some cases, successfully differentiating between wolves, dogs and fox tooth marks.

TI  - Who’s the Big Bad Wolf: Exploring Ranchers’ Attitudes on Expanding Gray Wolf Populations Across Eastern Washington Rangeland
PY  - 2013
AB  - In recent years Washington has seen a striking increase in the number of gray wolves residing within the state. In the last twelve months alone the number of wolves has jumped from 27 to well over 50. This growth has sparked fierce debate primarily between conservation groups and those involved in the cattle production industry. Urban conservation groups are unified in their support for wolf protection, yet less is known about what ranchers in the eastern part of the state want in regards to growing wolf numbers. Using mixed-methods and grounded theory, this exploratory study addresses stereotypes held by urban Washingtonians about rural ranchersthat is, that ranchers are unified, unyielding, and aggressive in their desire to once again eliminate wolves from the state. By conducting interviews with eastern Washington ranchers I found these stereotypes to be inaccurate, and discovered that most often ranchers are resigned to the urban-rural power dynamic, and simply more concerned with their ability to protect their livelihoods. Additionally, this research uncovered the profound mistrust held by many in the cattle production industry when asked to discuss the “wolf problem” with outsiders. This finding has profound implications for future policy which aims to support sustainable relationships between gray wolf conservation and agricultural interests. WHO’S THE BIG BAD WOLF: 3

TI  - Boundaries of the wolf and the wild: a conceptual examination of the relationship between rewilding and animal reintroduction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Animal reintroduction and rewilding are two widely appealing and frequently connected forms of ecological restoration. However, the critical assumption that animal reintroduction automatically helps to restore formerly wild places is under-theorized. To fill this void, we identified three common rewilding elements from the literature-ecological functioning, wilderness experience, and natural autonomy-and screened these against a hypothetical wolf reintroduction to Scotland. Each of the rewilding elements was likely to be positively impacted by a wolf reintroduction. Yet, there is a key conceptual difficulty in that the different rewilding elements do not necessarily enforce each other, and at times may even collide. Thus, a reintroduced species like the wolf may obfuscate the clear-cut, purified nature category to which rewilding often aspires. As a way forward, we suggest that there is merit in actively engaging with the tensions created by rewilding and reintroductions. A reconceptualisation of the nature-culture spectrum as consisting of multiple layers (e.g. ecological functioning, wilderness experience, and natural autonomy) may help to interpret ecological restoration as a tentative, deliberative, and gradual enterprise. This bears some resemblance to the notion of approaching a landscape like a 'palimpsest' (i.e. a text built up of different layers written on top of each other), which may support the reconciliation of conflicting views without necessarily making those disappear. When viewed as feeding into a multilayered nature-culture spectrum, animal reintroduction and rewilding can be promoted as inspiring and essentially non-controlling forms of ecological restoration and human interaction with nature.

TI  - Perfect poopers; passerine birds facilitate sexual reproduction in clonal keystone plants of the boreal forest through directed endozoochory towards dead wood
PY  - 2023
AB  - Berry-producing Vaccinium shrubs are keystone species in boreal forest ecosystems and their berries provide an essential food source for many vertebrates. In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris. In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns. We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.

TI  - Seasonal space use and habitat selection in magpie geese: implications for reducing human‐wildlife conflicts
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Negative interactions between waterbirds and people are increasing. Waterbirds feeding on agricultural crops cause significant losses to farmers worldwide, but so far most research to address these conflicts has been conducted on migratory species in the temperate northern hemisphere. We investigated the space use and habitat selection of the magpie goose (<jats:italic>Anseranas semipalmata</jats:italic>), a taxonomically distinct waterbird endemic to Australia and southern Papua New Guinea. In tropical northern Australia, magpie geese are protected but are increasingly persecuted by farmers to protect crops during the late dry–early wet season (~Sep–Jan), a bottleneck of natural resources for waterbirds in the monsoonal tropics. Using satellite telemetry of 38 geese spread across 3 seasons (2016–2017, 2017–2018, 2018–2019), we evaluated daily and seasonal space use, individual site fidelity, and habitat selection to determine the extent of use of agricultural fields by geese, and the spatiotemporal scales at which management should be undertaken. Geese used relatively small daily areas (<jats:italic>x̄</jats:italic> = 8.2 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) consistently throughout the late dry–early wet season, and repeatedly used agricultural fields, forested bushlands, and local wetlands. Geese used comparatively large seasonal areas (<jats:italic>x̄</jats:italic> = 219.5 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) encompassing several agricultural areas, and had a low mean overlap between successive weekly core activity areas, indicating that site fidelity rapidly weakened over time. These results suggest that farm‐scale (&lt;30 ha) management of geese is unlikely to be effective because hazed individuals are likely to be replaced soon afterwards. Instead, our findings suggest that goose management should be coordinated strategically at the local (~1,000 ha), or regional (~100,000 ha) scale. Farm‐level management would likely be more effective if implemented in conjunction with the creation of regional sanctuaries where geese could rest and potentially feed undisturbed away from farms. Our findings can be used by wildlife managers for optimizing the location of such sanctuaries and highlight the necessity for management to be adaptive given the opportunistic nature of the species.</jats:p>

TI  - Using stable isotopes to estimate reliance on agricultural food subsidies and migration timing for a migratory bird
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Anthropogenic activities have adversely transformed terrestrial ecosystems consequently limiting many species to more fragmented areas and increasing human–wildlife conflicts. Under some circumstances, this creates a need for management programs to support wildlife populations by subsidizing food resources. Evaluation and improvement of supplementary feeding practices should be implemented to determine dietary importance of supplementary food and identify when to make food resources available, an important consideration for migratory species using seasonal habitats. Large aggregations of greater sandhill cranes (<jats:italic>Antigone canadensis tabida</jats:italic>) wintering in the Middle Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico have come into conflict with agricultural practices. Resulting crop depredation on private lands has consequently required a mitigation program that subsidizes cranes with cultivated corn to manage their foraging behavior and provide nutritive support. To assess dependency of cranes on corn subsidies and estimate arrival dates of migratory sandhill cranes, we measured stable isotope ratios of liver and muscle tissues of sandhill cranes and their food items during winter. Over 60% of sandhill crane diet in the winter came from corn subsidies. Rates of carbon isotope incorporation in liver and muscle tissues were 0.03 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ± 0.02 (mean ± <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SE</jats:styled-content>) and 0.02 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ± 0.01, respectively, and differed predictably by metabolic activity of different tissues. Estimated arrival date on wintering grounds derived from rates of carbon isotope incorporation was November 6 ± 3 d (mean ± <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SE</jats:styled-content>) and was within 17 d of the estimated arrival date on the wintering grounds of sandhill cranes equipped with satellite transmitters (November 23 ± 2 d). Our approach demonstrates a field‐based application of intrinsic biomarkers to inform supplementary feeding practices for wildlife populations by identifying dietary response to supplementary food. Additionally, estimating arrival on wintering grounds supports management and conservation decisions by synchronizing availability of supplementary food resources with arrival times.</jats:p>

TI  - Understanding and overcoming obstacles in adaptive management.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Adaptive management (AM) is widely promoted to improve management of natural resources, yet its implementation is challenging. We show that obstacles to the implementation of AM are related not only to the AM process per se but also to external factors such as ecosystem properties and governance systems. To overcome obstacles, there is a need to build capacities within the AM process by ensuring adequate resources, management tools, collaboration, and learning. Additionally, building capacities in the legal and institutional frames can enable the necessary flexibility in the governance system. Furthermore, in systems experiencing profound changes in wildlife populations, building such capacities may be even more critical as more flexibility will be needed to cope with increased uncertainty and changed environmental conditions.

TI  - Residents' attitudes toward reintroduced sika deer in Kenting National Park, Taiwan
PY  - 2015
AB  - Hunting and habitat loss led to the extinction of the Formosan sika deer Cervus nippon taiouanus population in the wild in 1969. A sika deer restoration program has been in place in Kenting National Park (KTNP), Taiwan since 1984. Human—deer conflicts have increased following wild deer population growth. Understanding residents' attitudes toward reintroduced sika deer is vital to management policies. To investigate the local residents' attitudes, we collected 228 questionnaires through personal interviews in 2010. A majority of the respondents agreed that they would be happy to encounter a wild sika deer (78.1%), and a majority supported the restoration program in the KTNP (75.4%). However, 59.1% of the respondents knew little concerning the restoration program. Approximately half of the respondents (47.8%) thought that sika deer caused damages to crops, and 18.4% of the respondents actually suffered crop damages from deer. The farmers and people living within the deer's range were more vulnerable to deer...

TI  - Mixing plants from different origins to restore a declining population: ecological outcomes and local perceptions 10 years later.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Populations of the Large-flowered Sandwort (Arenaria grandiflora L.) in the Fontainebleau forest (France) have declined rapidly during the last century. Despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. The low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore Fontainebleau populations. Consequently, A. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the Fontainebleau forest in 1999. Each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. After establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. At present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. Analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil pH and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. This introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. To understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. From these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation.

TI  - Succession after Fire in a Coastal Pine Forest in Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - Biomass and chemical composition in six dominant field and bottom layer species have been recorded for 5 years after a wildfire in a coastal pine forest in Sveio, West Norway, in June 1992. As a follow-up of this study, the percentage coverage of field and bottom layer species and the regeneration of main tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens, and Salix spp.) were recorded in 1997, 2001, and 2008. Preliminary results indicate that the three dominant field layer species, Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, and Pteridium aquilinum, had expanded at the expense of other species, in particular Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Deschampsia flexuosa, and pioneer moss species, for example, Polytrichum spp. Seedlings of pine and saplings of birch and other deciduous species had established in the burned areas, and the succession of these species was followed and compared with nearby control plots. The strong growth of Calluna vulgaris after the fire indicates that periodic controlled burning may be an alternative management method of balancing carbon uptake rates in coastal areas of western Norway.

TI  - Does recolonization of wolves affect moose browsing damage on young Scots pine
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Ungulates frequently cause damage to human livelihoods, such as agriculture, livestock or forestry. In Sweden, forestry is the dominating land use and is a very important source of income. Moose (Alces alces) browsing commonly causes damage to young forest stands, mainly Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Factors known to affect the level of moose browsing damage are moose density, forage availability, site productivity, tree species composition, snow depth, and infrastructure. One hypothesis is that the recent recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden may lead to a decrease in browsing damage levels, through an effect of wolf predation on moose density or moose behaviour. We used data from annual moose browsing damage surveys, long-term wolf monitoring, moose harvest statistics, habitat composition, snow depth, and road network to investigate the effect of wolf recolonization on moose browsing damage on Scots pine. Contrary to predicted, wolf territory establishment and duration showed an increase in the level of moose damage on young Scots pine. But, the effect size was small and it is questionable if it can be considered as biologically relevant. Overall, other factors were more important than wolves in explaining browsing damage on pine by moose. Presence and cover of deciduous species increased the occurrence of moose browsing damage on pine but reduced the level of damage. Decreasing snow depth and increasing road density both resulted in a lower level of damage. We suggest that the strong human impact on all trophic levels on the Swedish forest ecosystem through harvest and intense forestry practices is likely to override wolves’ effects on density and behaviour of moose, as well as their potential effects on preferred browsing species for moose.

TI  - Fear of the unknown: local knowledge and perceptions of the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in western Macedonia
PY  - 2011
AB  - The remnant population of Balkan lynx Lynx lynx martinoi is small, isolated and highly threatened. Since 2006 a conservation project has surveyed its status and promoted its recovery in Albania and Macedonia. Eurasian lynx are often associated with conflicts of an economic or social nature, and their conservation requires a focus on the people sharing the landscape with the species. In this study we adopt methods and conceptual frameworks from anthropology to explore the local knowledge and perceptions of lynx among rural hunters and livestock breeders in the western mountains of the Republic of Macedonia in south-east Europe. The main finding was that local people rarely saw or interacted with lynx. As the level of interactions with this species is very low, the lynx doesn’t appear to be a species associated with conflicts in Macedonia. There was also a general lack of both scientific and local knowledge, which has led to somewhat negative attitudes, mainly based on myths and rumours. Poaching of lynx and their prey seem to be the main barriers to lynx conservation.

TI  - Goose management schemes to resolve conflicts with agriculture:Theory, practice and effects
PY  - 2017
AB  - In 2012, the four countries hosting the Svalbard population of pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus along its flyway launched an International Species Management Plan for the population. One of the aims was to reduce conflicts between geese and agriculture to an acceptable level. Since 2006, Norway has offered subsidies to farmers that provide refuge areas for geese on their land. We evaluate the mid-Norwegian goose management subsidy scheme, with a view to its adjustment to prevailing ecological and socio-economic parameters. The analysis indicates that the legitimacy of the scheme is highly dependent on transparency of knowledge management and accountability of management scheme to the farming community. Among farmers, as well as front-line officials, outcomes of prioritisation processes within the scheme are judged unfair when there is an evident mismatch between payments and genuine damage. We suggest how the scheme can be made more fair and responsive to ecological changes, within a framework of adaptive management.

TI  - When horizons do not merge: Perplexity, doubt, and research implications
PY  - 2011
AB  - Gadamer claims that the horizons of the listener and the narrator merge and create a new understanding of the narrative's meaning. This study examines encounters between researcher and informant in which these horizons do not merge, encounters--usually ignored in the literature--in which the researcher senses that the informant's statements raise questions, cause confusion, or are perceived as perhaps unacceptable. It analyzes these moments and their implications regarding the research process and findings. We claim that not all statements are accepted. Researchers sift through questionable data, disregarding it at times. This may cause a "converse error," leading researchers to ignore information perceived as doubtful that in fact could be valuable and contribute innovative understandings and knowledge. Language: en

TI  - Building a just transition in asia-pacific: Four strategies for reducing fossil fuel dependence and investing in clean energy
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Asia Pacific region is notable for its vulnerability to climate change, its varied ability to respond to its impacts, and its dependence on coal. However, recent years have seen an increase in the use of renewable energy sources. We focus on the ‘just energy transition’, a framework which emphasizes the necessity for social justice in a low carbon world. But how well are Asia Pacific states performing in matters of justice and energy transition? We outline four components of a just transition initiative to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and increase investments in clean energy, based on open-access quantitative data. These include increasing investments in clean energy, prioritizing equity in decision-making, developing comprehensive financing strategies, and prioritizing restorative justice approaches. The aim is to ensure affected communities are fairly compensated for losses, have access to employment rights programs, and can transition towards new jobs in alternative sectors.

TI  - Agriculture and herbivorous waterfowl: a review of the scientific basis for improved management
PY  - 2016
AB  - Swans, geese and some ducks (Anatidae) are obligate herbivores, many are important quarry species and all contribute to a variety of ecosystem services. Population growth and shifting ranges have led to increasing proximity to man and thus increasing conflicts. We review and synthesize the role of these birds as herbivores on agricultural land (cropland, rotational grassland and pasture) and other terrestrial habitats where conflict with human interests may occur. A bibliographic analysis of peer-reviewed papers (N = 359) shows that publication activity peaked in 1991-2000 in North America and 2000-2010 in Europe, and has decreased since. Taxonomic and geographical biases are obvious in research to date: Snow Goose Chen caerulescens was the most studied species (N = 98), and Canada Branta canadensis, Barnacle B. leucopsis and Brent geese B. bernicla all featured in more than 40 studies; most studies originated in northwest Europe or North America, very few have been carried out in Asia and European Russia. On the basis of nutrient/energy budgets of herbivorous waterfowl, it is evident that dense single-species crops (such as rotational grassland, early-growth cereals and root crops) and spilled grain in agricultural landscapes offer elevated energetic and nutritional intake rates of food of higher quality compared to natural or semi-natural vegetation. Hence, although affected by seasonal nutritional demands, proximity to roost, field size, disturbance levels, access to water, food depletion and snow cover, agricultural landscapes tend to offer superior foraging opportunities over natural habitats, creating potential conflict with agriculture. Herbivorous waterfowl select for high protein, soluble carbohydrate and water content, high digestibility as well as low fibre and phenolic compounds, but intake rates from grazing varied with goose body and bill morphology, creating species-specific loci for conflict. Crop damage by trampling and puddling has not been demonstrated convincingly, nor do waterfowl faeces deter grazing stock, but where consumption of crops evidently reduces yields this causes conflict with farmers. Studies show that it is difficult and expensive to assess the precise impacts of waterfowl feeding on yield loss because of other sources of variation. However, less damage has been documented from winter grazing compared to spring grazing and yield loss after spring grazing on grassland appears more pronounced than losses on cereal fields. Although yield losses at national scales are trivial, individual farmers in areas of greatest waterfowl feeding concentrations suffer disproportionately, necessitating improved solutions to conflict. Accordingly, we review the efficacy of population management, disturbance, provision of alternative feeding areas, compensation and large-scale stakeholder involvement and co-management as options for resolving conflict based on the existing literature and present a framework of management advice for the future. We conclude with an assessment of the research needs for the immediate future to inform policy development, improve management of waterfowl populations and reduce conflict with agriculture.

TI  - Experiences from a National Landscape Monitoring Programme—Maintaining Continuity Whilst Meeting Changing Demands and Opportunities
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in recording landscape change. Monitoring programmes have been established to measure the scope, direction and rate of change, and assess the consequences of changes for multiple interests, such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. The results can provide feedback for multiple sectors and policy domains. Political interests may change over time, but long-term monitoring demands long-term funding. This requires that monitoring programmes remain relevant and cost-efficient. In this paper, we document experiences from 20 years of the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes—the ‘3Q Programme’. We explain how data availability and demands for information have changed over time, and how the monitoring programme has been adapted to remain relevant. We also discuss how methods of presentation influence the degree of knowledge transfer to stakeholders, in particular to policy makers.

TI  - Analysis of post-fire effects in pine stands in various landscape conditions of the boreal zone
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The study analyzes the pyrogenic effect on the condition of pine trees in two landscapes of the Leningrad region. The polynomial regression method in the description of the process tree attrition depending on the scorch height on the trunk allowed determining the trend of the thinning process for pine trees in different vitality conditions. The post-fire attrition of trees follows different scenarios in the studied landscapes of the Luga Upland and Putilov Plateau. The correlation analysis showed that the inverse relationship between the thickness of the remaining forest ground cover and the scorch height on trunks, i.e., the intensity of the past fire, is stronger in the landscape of the Putilov Plateau than in the Luga landscape. The studied landscapes created a different environment for the emergence and spread of fires of both natural and anthropogenic origin.</jats:p>

TI  - Methods to Create a Longitudinal Integrated Demographic and Geographic Database on the Micro-Level: A Case Study of Five Swedish Rural Parishes, 1813–1914
PY  - 2015
AB  - AbstractThe authors develop a methodology to create databases that can be used to add micro-level geographic context to longitudinal historical demographic analyses. The method transforms geographic objects as snapshots (digitized from historical maps) into temporal representations of longitudinal object lifelines and links individuals to these geographic objects. The methodology is evaluated via a case study using historical data from the Scanian Economic Demographic Database. The authors link approximately 53,000 individuals in five parishes for the period 1813–1914 to the property units in which they had lived. The results of this study are a unique contribution in terms of linking individuals to micro-level longitudinal geographic data over such long periods. Thus, these data may provide new knowledge for historical demographic research.

TI  - Spatial pattern assessment of tropical forest fire danger at Thuan Chau area (Vietnam) using GIS-based advanced machine learning algorithms: A comparative study
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Thuan Chau is a serious district affected by forest fire in Vietnam, especially in 2016; however, no forest fire prediction research has been conducted for this region. Thus, knowledge of spatial patterns of fire danger of the district plays a key role in forest succession and ecological implications. This study's aim was to analyze the spatial pattern of fire danger for the tropical forest of Thuan Chau district using advanced machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVMC), Random Forests (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-Net). For this purpose, a GIS database for the study area was established with 564 forest fire locations and ten forest fire variables. Then, Pearson correlation method was used to assess the correlation of the variables with the forest fire. In the next step, three forest fire danger models, SVMC, RF, and MLP-Net, were trained and validated. Finally, global performance of these models was assessed using the classification accuracy (ACC), Kappa statistics (KS), Area under the curve (AUC). In addition, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to check the prediction performance of these models. The result shows the three models performed well; however, the MLP-Net model has the highest prediction performance (ACC = 81.7, KS = 0.633, and AUC = 0.894), followed by the RF model (ACC = 81.1, KS = 0.621, and AUC = 0.883), and the SVMC model (ACC = 80.2, KS = 0.604, and AUC = 0.867). The result in this study is useful for the local authority and forest manager in forest management and fire suppression.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>The European large carnivore community is recently showing positive trends. Beyond those, other species are expanding in Europe. In recent decades, the golden jackal (<jats:italic>Canis aureus</jats:italic>), a medium-sized canid, has rapidly expanded to western and northern Europe, after being historically confined to the Balkans. The Eurasian lynx (<jats:italic>Lynx lynx</jats:italic>), an apex predator once widely distributed throughout Europe, was nearly eradicated in the 19th century. Recent reintroductions, legal protection, and its natural expansion brought the lynx to recover, though some populations still face extinction.

TI  - Does predation by wolves reduce collisions between ungulates and vehicles in France?
PY  - 2022
AB  - The recolonization of French forests by wolves is met with mixed feelings. While the spotlight is on predation of wolves on livestock, the potential benefit of the return of wolves has attracted less attention. Previous research has failed to assess the economic value of these benefits and focused only on the cost of predation. Our study proposes a modeling exercise to evaluate one of the services provided by wolves, namely, the reduction of collisions between wildlife and vehicles in France. We estimated that in 2018 the consumption of roe deer and wild boar by wolves saved between 2.4–7.8 million euros by preventing casualties and damage to property in road collisions. Offsetting this benefit with the costs of managing livestock predation could move the debate away from a simple clash between herders and environmentalists toward a more systemic approach and thus improve coexistence between wolves and humans.

TI  - Application of remote sensing data for measuring freshwater ecosystems changes below the Zeya dam in the Russian Far East
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract. The large Zeya hydropower dam is located on the Zeya River, the largest left-bank tributary of the Amur-Heilong River in Russia. The dam had been constructed by 1980 and its operation has significantly transformed the flow regime of the Zeya River. The flow regulation has reduced the magnitude of periodic flooding of the floodplain areas located downstream from the Zeya dam and disrupted habitats of flora and fauna. An estimation of the transformation of the freshwater ecosystems is required to develop measures necessary either to maintain or restore disrupted ecosystems. Application of remote sensing methods allows measuring characteristics of the ecosystem's components. Two sections of a floodplain below the Zeya dam were considered for analysis in order to detect changes in objects at each site during the comparison of remote data from 1969/1971 and 2016.

TI  - The Cows May Safely Graze: Placing Expert‐Lay Relationships at the Center of Overcoming the Expert‐Lay Knowledge Divide*
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many scholars agree that both expert and lay knowledge are needed to gain a fuller understanding of environmental problems, both to find answers to the problems and to improve relations between experts and laypeople. When experts ignore lay knowledge, laypeople can resist by accusing experts of arrogance or conspiracy. Rural people who live among large carnivores like wolves and grizzly bears sometimes distrust expert knowledge or even promulgate conspiracy theories. One's knowledge is inextricably linked with one's identity and social relationships. In this ethnographic study, I examine how a Montana‐based non‐profit, Blackfoot Challenge (BC), facilitates the exchange of knowledge between experts and laypeople for carnivore management. Nurturing expert‐lay relationships is one strategy that BC uses in concert with two others to bridge the expert‐lay knowledge divide: facilitating learning experiences and relying on intermediaries. Knowledge exchanged within expert relationships allows experts to better understand the needs of laypeople and adapt their work to meet those needs while also disseminating expert knowledge to laypeople in a way that earns their trust. The trust built within expert‐lay relationships facilitates the exchange of knowledge, but the way experts and laypeople exchange knowledge also builds trust.</jats:p>

TI  - Stand Age Influence on Potential Wildfire Ignition and Spread in the Boreal Forest of Northeastern Canada
PY  - 2018
AB  - Although it has long been assumed that wildfire occurrence is independent of stand age in the North American boreal forest, recent studies indicate that young forests may influence burn rates by limiting the ignition and spread of fires for several years. Wildfires not only structure the stand-age mosaic of boreal landscapes, but also alter the likelihood and behavior of subsequent fires. Using a fire simulation model, we evaluated the effect of stand age on the magnitude and spatial patterns of burn probability (BP) in the boreal forest of northeastern Canada. Specifically, we assessed the stand age effect on the two processes driving fire likelihood, ignition and spread, by simulating tens of thousands of fires under three fire regime scenarios that vary in terms of mean fire size and number of burned patches. Assuming minimal resistance to fire ignition and spread, where only the youngest stands (≤ 10 years) are resistant to burning, mean BP is reduced by 10%; in contrast, assuming maximum resistance, where stands up to 90 years old impede wildfires, mean BP can be reduced up to 85%. Although the resistance to ignition on BP is almost identical in magnitude to that of spread, it yields substantially different spatial arrangements of BP. Furthermore, stand age resistance reduces subsequent fire activity not only within but also outside the perimeter of burned patches through a shadow effect. Our results help to untangle the role of factors contributing to stand age resistance on wildfires and offer new insights for improving the spatial mapping of fire likelihood.

TI  - Early community recommendations for sustainable mega-events: evidence from the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games
PY  - 2022
AB  - Recommendations are a high form of community consultation, but rarely solicited in surveys of resident attitudes despite their potential to better inform planning and foster stronger event loyalty in an era of mega-event crisis. This paper innovates by identifying and structuring open-ended recommendations for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games from host region residents 10 years prior to that mega-event. From an online survey of 897 respondents, 946 discrete recommendations for event “success” were organised through thematic analysis into high level “event,” “community” and “organiser” themes. In the emergent community vision for the Games derived from these themes, host city residents aspire for efficient, affordable, and authentic Games that benefit and involve the host community and learn from the past. The vision’s focus on resident self-interest is unsurprising but challenges event organisers to accommodate the interests of multiple stakeholders. The aspiration for a sustainable community, nevertheless, is conducive to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and complements recent IOC reforms and the official 2032 Games Vision which call for greater responsiveness to host community interests. Under a framework of soft transformative governance, facilitating micro-transformations should ensure that marginalised groups are heard and their aspirations integrated into early mega-event planning.

TI  - Large grazing birds and agriculture—predicting field use of common cranes and implications for crop damage prevention
PY  - 2016
AB  - A B S T R A C T Increasing numbers of previously threatened large grazing birds (cranes, geese and swans) are causing crop damage along their flyways worldwide. For example, the number of reported incidents of crop damage caused by common cranes Grus grus, followed by regulated inspections and governmental compensation in Sweden, has increased over the last few decades and was valued at � 200,000 Euros in 2012. Consequently, their impact on agriculture is escalating which raises the need for evidenceinformed preventative strategies. We surveyed arable fields for autumn staging common cranes in an area surrounding a wetland reserve in Sweden. We assessed the following factors in relation to the probability of cranes being present on fields: crop stage, crop type, distance to roost site, time of day, field size and time since harvest. Stubble fields had the highest probability of crane presence, progressively decreasing through grassland and grazing grounds, bare soil to growing crop. A stubble field at 5 km from a roost site had a predicted probability (95% CI) of hosting cranes of 0.25 (0.19–0.32). The probability of cranes visiting a field was linearly and negatively related to distance to the roost site. For example, the probability of crane presence increased from 0.05 (0.03–0.07) to 0.09 (0.06–0.15) when distance decreased from 5 to 1 km. At stubble fields, the probability of crane presence decreased with time since harvest and was highest for barley with progressively lower probability on wheat and oat. Illustrative scenario predictions developed from the models demonstrated that probability of crane presence could be high, 0.60 (0.42–0.77), if all favorable factors were combined (e.g. barley stubble, 1 day after harvest, 1 km from roost site). Given the existing framework of international conventions and prohibition of culling, there is a need for preventative strategies to reduce crop damage. Based on our results, such strategies should focus on providing cereal stubbles as diversionary fields, especially close to wetland roosting sites. Stubble field availability can be achieved by careful crop rotation planning. We suggest that crop rotation and time of harvest should be added to flyway management plans recently developed for some large grazing bird species to facilitate stable co-existence between conservation practices and agricultural interests.

However, the conflict over whether Sweden should host a wolf population sets views on biodiversity and sustainable development against the perspective that local traditions and livelihoods are threatened by the return of wolves. These diverging environmental visions can be seen as competing interests and understandings of nature and wildlife. The desire of the state and nature conservation organisations to implement measures to provide conditions fostering wolf survival are counterbalanced by local action groups and community residents struggling to maintain conditions for conserving summer pastures, opportunities for hunting with sporting dogs, and other recreational activities such as mushroom- and berry-picking. Not only are these activities considered to have high natural and cultural value, the European Union (EU) has stated that small-scale farming is important for maintaining the landscape and safeguarding the survival of values associated with 'agri-environmental' habitats. The conflict between the interest groups is essentially about the access to and use of environmental resources. Squeezed between policies safeguarding wolf populations, preventing cruelty to animals and implementing activities required by the EU agricultural programme, farmers in areas with resident wolf populations have come to take part in processes that may reinforce rural identity.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Climate Change Versus Land Use on Tree- and Forest Line Dynamics in Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - Alpine tree- and forest lines (TFL) are dynamic, influenced by a variety of processes. In Norway, where TFLs are dominated by deciduous mountain birch, the lines are generally on the move to higher altitudes. Contemporary land use changes interfere the interpretation of the consequences of recent high latitude warming for TFL dynamics due to possible combined effects. We have assessed all available long-term studies (>30 years) (n = 8) of TFL dynamics focusing on separating the effects of climate change from those of changed land use in Norway. Most of the studies emphasize the importance of changed land use on TFL dynamics. However, a deeper understanding of the relevance of land use changes and climate changes for TLF dynamics and of possible interacting effects is hampered by a lack of spatially representative TFL change data and site-specific climate and land use change data.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of electricity generation: A systematic review of spatiotemporal methods
PY  - 2021
AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of electricity generation are increasingly incorporating more granular spatial and temporal information, enhancing the accuracy of both inventories and results. This systematic review determined contributions to LCA that improved spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal resolution from 2009-2018. We analyzed 251 articles screened from an initial review of 6,519 to identify such contributions and determine areas in need of research. The geographic focus of the studies leans towards Europe, Asia, and North America, suggesting many regions remain understudied. As the impact categories were heavily weighted towards greenhouse gas emissions, the impacts that may benefit most from more granular analyses reflecting local environmental conditions were less studied (e.g., land use and eutrophication). While studies tend to focus more on spatial rather than temporal information, those that examine the most granular spatial and temporal scales (for this review, site and hourly) can result in more effective interventions that improve both environmental and economic outcomes. The two most common analysis tools used in the screened articles were optimization and Geographic Information Systems. The increasing use of these tools supported diverse improvements in LCA, such as more detailed investigations of grid interactions, enhanced characterization of impacts, and improved evaluation of resource availability. Analyses conducted at more refined spatiotemporal resolutions can provide more realistic representations of electricity generation, grid operations, and environmental impacts, supporting more effective interventions.

TI  - Strengthening the Network of High Conservation Value Forests in Boreal Landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - The natural and old-growth forests and their associated biodiversity continues to fade worldwide due to anthropogenic impact in various forms. The boreal forests in Fennoscandia have been subject to intensive clearfelling-based forestry since the middle of 20th century. As a result, only a fraction of forests with long temporal continuity remains at the landscape level. In Sweden, some of these primary forests have been formally protected, whereas others that have also been identified as having conservation value, are located outside the protected area network. Collectively, both protected and not protected known valuable primary forests are included in a nationally delineated network of high conservation value forests (HCVF). In addition to HCVF, older forests that have not been clearfelled since the mid-1900s, i.e. “proxy continuity forests”, have recently been mapped across the entire boreal biome in Sweden. In this paper, we analyze how these proxy continuity forests may strengthen the HCVF-network from a green infrastructure perspective. First, we evaluated the spatial overlap between proxy continuity forests and HCVF. Second, we performed a large-scale connectivity analysis, where we showed that adding proxy continuity forests located outside HCVF strongly increases the structural connectivity of protected-forest network. Finally, by assessing habitat suitability for virtual species specialized in pine, spruce and broadleaf forests, we found large regional differences in the ability to secure habitat and thereby functional green infrastructure by considering currently unprotected primary forest with high conservation value. We show that by protecting those forests, the area of habitat for low demanding species dependent on spruce or pine forests can be largely increased. For high demanding species additional habitat restoration in the landscape matrix is needed. By contrast, even counting all valuable broadleaf forests available, is not enough to provide suitable habitat for their associated species, which indicates a large need for landscape-scale habitat restoration initiatives in particular for broadleaf forests.

TI  - One rule does not fit it all: Patterns and drivers of stakeholders perspectives of the endangered Iberian wolf
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Public attitudes are vital for the successful implementation of management strategies and conservation programs. However, contradictory interests among different stakeholders can create important setbacks, creating barriers to achieve conservation goals. The endangered Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) occupies now only 20 % of its historical distribution area, in Portugal, and its reduction was mostly due to direct human persecution. Here, we assessed locals’ attitudes towards the Iberian wolf in northeast Portugal, in a region where humans and wolves coexist for centuries. A total of 323 questionnaires from three different interest groups (general public, livestock owners and hunters) were analysed. We tested the differences in attitude and fear level patterns between the different groups and assessed what socio-demographic factors could be influencing the detected patterns. We found that general attitude towards this carnivore was neutral to positive, probably owing to the low levels of livestock predation and long coexistence with local populations. However, most drivers differed among stakeholders groups. Education, knowledge, and level of fear were strong predictors explaining attitudes towards this endangered species. We stress the importance of assessing attitudes patterns and identifying the socio-psychological factors as necessary tools to facilitate the development of targeted tolerance-promoting strategies. Among other instruments, increasing locals’ tolerance toward the Iberian wolf can be achieved by target education interventions, where the stakeholders can actively take part in discussions to accommodate their needs and expectation, rather than be listeners of the implemented programs.

TI  - Overview of recent land cover changes, forest harvest areas, and soil erosion trends in Nordic countries
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Mapping spatiotemporal land cover changes offers opportunities to better understand trends and drivers of environmental change and helps to identify more sustainable land management strategies. This study investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in land covers, forest harvest areas and soil erosion rates in Nordic countries, namely Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. This region is highly sensitive to environmental changes, as it is experiencing high levels of human pressure and among the highest rates of global warming. An analysis that uses consistent land cover dataset to quantify and compares the recent spatiotemporal changes in land cover in the Nordic countries is missing. The recent products issued by the European Space Agency and the Copernicus Climate Change Service framework provide the possibility to investigate the historical land cover changes from 1992 to 2018 at 300 m resolution. These maps are then integrated with time series of forest harvest areas between 2004 and 2018 to study if and how forest management is represented in land cover products, and with soil erosion data to explore status and recent trends in agricultural land. Land cover changes typically involved from 4% to 9% of the total area in each country. Wetland showed the strongest reduction (11,003 km2, −11% of the wetland area in 1992), followed by forest (8,607 km2, −1%) and sparse vegetation (5,695 km2, −7%), while agriculture (15,884 km2, 16%) and settlement (3,582 km2, 84%) showed net increases. Wetland shrinkage dominated land cover changes in Norway (5,870 km2, −18%), followed by forest and grassland with a net gain of 3,441 km2 (3%) and 3, 435 km2 (10%), respectively. In Sweden, forest areas decreased 13,008 km2 (−4%), mainly due to agriculture expansion (9,211 km2, 29%). In Finland, agricultural areas increased by 5,982 km2 (24%), and wetland decreased by 6,698 km2 (−22%). Settlement had the largest net growth in Denmark (717 km2, 70%), mainly from conversion of agriculture land. Soil erosion rates in Nordic countries are lower than the global average, but they are exacerbating in several locations (especially western Norway). The integration of the land cover datasets with maps of forest harvest areas shows that the majority of the losses in forest cover due to forestry operations are largely undetected, but a non-negligible share of the forest-to-agriculture (up to 19%) or forest-to-grassland (up to 51%) transitions overlap with the harvested sites. Forestry activity in the study region primarily involves small-scale harvest events that are difficult to be detected at the 300 m resolution of the land cover dataset. An accurate representation of forest management remains a challenge for global datasets of land cover time series, and more interdisciplinary international efforts are needed to address this gap. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed overview of recent changes in land cover and forest management in Nordic countries as represented by state-of-the-art global datasets, and offers insights to future studies aiming to improve these data or apply them in land surface models, climate models, landscape ecology, or other applications.

TI  - Using a Cellular Automata-Markov Model to Reconstruct Spatial Land-Use Patterns in Zhenlai County, Northeast China
PY  - 2015
AB  - Decadal to centennial land use and land cover change has been consistently singled out as a key element and an important driver of global environmental change, playing an essential role in balancing energy use. Understanding long-term human-environment interactions requires historical reconstruction of past land use and land cover changes. Most of the existing historical reconstructions have insufficient spatial and thematic detail and do not consider various land change types. In this context, this paper explored the possibility of using a cellular automata-Markov model in 90 m × 90 m spatial resolution to reconstruct historical land use in the 1930s in Zhenlai County, China. Then the three-map comparison methodology was employed to assess the predictive accuracy of the transition modeling. The model could produce backward projections by analyzing land use changes in recent decades, assuming that the present land use pattern is dynamically dependent on the historical one. The reconstruction results indicated that in the 1930s most of the study area was occupied by grasslands, followed by wetlands and arable land, while other land categories occupied relatively small areas. Analysis of the three-map comparison illustrated that the major differences among the three maps have less to do with the simulation model and more to do with the inconsistencies among the land categories during the study period. Different information provided by topographic maps and remote sensing images must be recognized.

TI  - Population change in breeding boreal waterbirds in a 25‐year perspective: What characterises winners and losers?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding drivers of variation and trends in biodiversity change is a general scientific challenge, but also crucial for conservation and management. Previous research shows that patterns of increase and decrease are not always consistent at different spatial scales, calling for approaches combining the latter. We here explore the idea that functional traits of species may help explaining divergent population trends. Complementing a previous community level study, we here analyse data about breeding waterbirds on 58 wetlands in boreal Fennoscandia, covering gradients in latitude as well as trophic status. We used linear mixed models to address how change in local abundance over 25 years in 25 waterbird species are associated with life history traits, diet, distribution, breeding phenology, and habitat affinity. Mean abundance increased in 10 species from 1990/1991 to 2016, whereas it decreased in 15 species. Local population increases were associated with species that are early breeders and have small clutches, an affinity for luxurious wetlands, an herbivorous diet, and a wide breeding range rather than a southern distribution. Local decreases, by contrast, were associated with species having large clutches and invertivorous diet, as well as being late breeders and less confined to luxurious wetlands. The three species occurring on the highest number of wetlands all decreased in mean abundance. The fact that early breeders have done better than late fits well with previous research about adaptability to climate change, that is, response to earlier springs. We found only limited support for the idea that life history traits are good predictors of wetland level population change. Instead, diet turned out to be a strong candidate for an important driver of population change, as supported by a general decrease of invertivores and a concomitant increase of large herbivores. In a wider perspective, future research needs to address whether population growth of large‐bodied aquatic herbivores affects abundance of co‐occurring invertivorous species, and if so, if this is due to habitat alteration, or to interference or exploitative competition.

TI  - Linking Ecosystem Services with Cultural Landscape Research
PY  - 2010
AB  - The concept of ecosystem services facilitates the valuation of the multiple services from ecosystems and landscapes, the identification of trade-offs between different land use scenarios, and also informs decision making in land use planning. Unfortunately, cultural services have been mostly neglected within the ecosystem services framework. This could result in trade-off assessments which are biased and mislead ecosystem management and landscape planning. However, cultural landscape research approaches have proven valuable in the assessment of different nonmaterial landscape values and cultural services. In this paper, we compare the objectives, approaches, and methodologies adopted by eco system services research and cultural landscape research through a bibliographic research. Both research communities investigate the human dimension of ecosystems and landscapes and, hence, study the same object. A closer link between the two research communities would enrich and possibly sharpen both approaches. In particular, landscape research on cultural services such as aesthet ics or cultural heritage could provide valuable results and methods for a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services.

TI  - Environmental attitudes associated with large-scale cultural differences, not local environmental conflicts
PY  - 2014
AB  - Species and ecosystems are under constant pressure from a rapidly-growing human population. Human tolerance of carnivores, including the willingness to live in areas with these predators, is key to the success of large carnivore conservation. In the Scandinavian Peninsula, large carnivore populations conflict with human activity; low tolerance among local people may lead to illegal hunting. A survey of 2521 Scandinavian respondents to measure environmental value orientation, using the new environmental paradigm (NEP) scale and attitudes toward large carnivores, revealed attitudes towards the presence of carnivores were not related to carnivore abundance. Nor was there a significant relationship between environmental value orientation and personal experiences with loss of domestic sheep or hunting dogs. Environmental values were mainly explained by country differences; Swedes had a more ecocentric value orientation than Norwegians. Significantly more Norwegians (45 %) than Swedes (19 %) responded that there were too many carnivores in their country. Historic differences in how government is perceived between Norway and Sweden may result in different attitudes towards illegal hunting and towards carnivores. Specifically, Norwegians may hold a more anthropocentric view, based on a suspicion of central authorities, whereas Swedes may hold a more ecocentric view.

TI  - The first annually resolved analysis of slash-and-burn practices in the boreal Eurasia suggests their strong climatic and socio-economic controls
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Slash-and-burn (SAB) was a widespread agricultural practice across large parts of the boreal region until the early 20th century. Despite its paramount importance in the procurement of food and particularly in supporting frontier populations of settlers during the colonization of the Eurasian boreal zone, analyses of spatial and temporal patterns in the use of SAB at annual and sub-annual scales are currently missing. We present the first such analysis of climatic and social controls of SAB practices in a remote region in the northern Ural mountains from 1880 to 1894. We observed a significant positive correlation between the total number of burns and the village population (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.005, R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.26), indicating that the frequency of burns directly reflected the local demand for food. The amount of agricultural land, regarded as a cumulative measure of burning activity over multiple decades, showed a strong positive correlation with the village population (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001, R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.60). This result supported our interpretation of burns as an important food procurement tool, probably also positively affected by higher labour availability in larger villages. Villages where the number of burns were higher than predicted by the “the population vs. burns” regression tended (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.15) to have larger areas of arable land than predicted by the “population vs. arable land” regression. This pattern implied that variability in the local environmental and/or socio-economic settings of the villages made some of them more (or otherwise less) favourable for agricultural activities based on SAB. Most reported burns occurred in June and July. The three years with the maximum number of reported burns had a tendency to be wetter during these months when compared to the same period during an “average” year (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.19). The pattern suggested that farmers preferred conducting burns during years with a below-average climatological fire hazard. An earlier start of the fire season favoured burning activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.10 R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.33), while its later ending had no significant effect on the number of burns (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.53). Our study documented strong climatic controls of SAB practices at the annual scale and their social controls at above-annual scales. These patterns emerged despite the common use of slash-and-burn to mitigate generally limited food availability in the northern Ural mountain region and likely conservative estimates of these practices in available records.</jats:p>

TI  - The range of the mange: Spatiotemporal patterns of sarcoptic mange in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) as revealed by camera trapping.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Sarcoptic mange is a widely distributed disease that affects numerous mammalian species. We used camera traps to investigate the apparent prevalence and spatiotemporal dynamics of sarcoptic mange in a red fox population in southeastern Norway. We monitored red foxes for five years using 305 camera traps distributed across an 18000 km2 area. A total of 6581 fox events were examined to visually identify mange compatible lesions. We investigated factors associated with the occurrence of mange by using logistic models within a Bayesian framework, whereas the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease were analysed with space-time scan statistics. The apparent prevalence of the disease fluctuated over the study period with a mean of 3.15% and credible interval [1.25, 6.37], and our best logistic model explaining the presence of red foxes with mange-compatible lesions included time since the beginning of the study and the interaction between distance to settlement and season as explanatory variables. The scan analyses detected several potential clusters of the disease that varied in persistence and size, and the locations in the cluster with the highest probability were closer to human settlements than the other survey locations. Our results indicate that red foxes in an advanced stage of the disease are most likely found closer to human settlements during periods of low wild prey availability (winter). We discuss different potential causes. Furthermore, the disease appears to follow a pattern of small localized outbreaks rather than sporadic isolated events.

TI  - Cyclic small rodents in boreal forests and the effects of even-aged forest management: Patterns and predictions from a long-term study in southeastern Norway
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Small mammals, especially microtine rodents, play an important role in the dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems. Even-aged forest management, in which old, semi-natural forests are converted to clear-cuts and culturally regenerated stands, is expected to have pronounced impact on the abundance and composition of this group of animals due to changes in the understory vegetation. During a 39 year-period we sampled autumn numbers of small mammals in uncut, semi-natural old forest and in recent clearcuts, supplemented by a 7-year sample from middle-aged plantations. Field voles Microtus agrestis were almost exclusively trapped in clearcuts. Bank voles Myodes glareolus dominated in the old forest, but reached equal or higher densities than field voles in clearcuts. Here, their combined abundance exceeded that of bank voles in old forest. Some years, wood lemmings Myopus schisticolor contributed significantly to vole abundance in old forest. Other rodents Apodemus spp. were rarely captured, mainly in clearcuts, and shrews Sorex spp. numbered

PY  - 2016
AB  - Rumours associated with wildlife are frequent, although they have received little attention in the scientific literature. Studying rumours is important because of their relevance not only in a broad theoretical sense but also in environmental management. The goal of this study is to explore the complexity of the relationships between humans and wildlife through a thematic analysis of rumours associated with allegedly introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that cause crop damage in Spain. For this purpose, potential rumours were identified using the Google search engine. Data analysis consisted of reading and re-reading Web-based texts to identify main themes, ideas and topics with the assistance of NVivo 10 software. The analysis identified three main themes: (1) the reviewed websites referred to allegedly introduced rabbits which differed from native rabbits; (2) differences were based on alleged observations of unnatural behaviour, physiology or physical appearance of introduced rabbits; (3) rumours were frequently used in the context of the rabbit management conflict; e.g. farmers accused hunters of releasing harmful rabbits. This study suggests that the analysis of wildlife-release rumours sheds light on the position of parties involved in conflicts associated with the (alleged) introduction of wildlife species. It stresses the importance of rumours in conservation and environmental management, and opens the door to future research.

TI  - Representative boreal forest habitats in northern Europe, and a revised model for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The natural range of variation of ecosystems provides reference conditions for sustainable management and biodiversity conservation. We review how the understanding of natural reference conditions of boreal forests in northern Europe has changed from earlier perceptions of even-aged dynamics driven by stand-replacing disturbances towards current understanding highlighting the role of non-stand-replacing disturbances and the resultant complex forest dynamics and structures. We show how earlier views and conceptual models of forest disturbance dynamics, including the influential ASIO model, provide estimates of reference conditions that are outside the natural range of variation. Based on a research synthesis, we present a revised forest reference model incorporating the observed complexity of ecosystem dynamics and the prevalence of old forests. Finally, we outline a management model and demonstrate its use in forest ecosystem management and show how regional conservation area needs can be estimated. We conclude that attaining favourable conservation status in northern Europe’s boreal forests requires increasing emphasis on ecosystem management and conservation for old forest characteristics.

TI  - Lightning-ignited wildfires and long continuing current lightning in the Mediterranean Basin: preferential meteorological conditions
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract. Lightning is the major cause of the natural ignition of wildfires worldwide and produces the largest wildfires in some regions. Lightning strokes produce about 5 % of forest fires in the Mediterranean Basin and are one of the most important precursors of the largest forest fires during the summer. Lightning-ignited wildfires produce significant emissions of aerosols, black carbon, and trace gases, such as CO, SO2 , CH4 , and O3 , affecting air quality. Characterization of the meteorological and cloud conditions of lightning-ignited wildfires in the Mediterranean Basin can serve to improve fire forecasting models and to upgrade the implementation of fire emissions in atmospheric models. This study investigates the meteorological and cloud conditions of lightning-ignited wildfires (LIWs) and long continuing current (LCC) lightning flashes in the Iberian Peninsula and Greece. LCC lightning and lightning in dry thunderstorms with a low precipitation rate have been proposed to be the main precursors of the largest wildfires. We use lightning data provided by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN), and the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board the International Space Station (ISS), together with four databases of wildfires produced in Spain, Portugal, southern France, and Greece, respectively, in order to produce a climatology of LIWs and LCC lightning over the Mediterranean Basin. In addition, we use meteorological data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data set and by the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), together with the Cloud Top Height product (CTHP) derived from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites measurements to investigate the meteorological conditions of LIWs and LCC lightning. According to our results, LIWs and a significant amount of LCC lightning flashes tend to occur in dry thunderstorms with weak updrafts. Our results suggest that LIWs tend to occur in clouds with a high base and with a vertical content of moisture lower than the climatological value, as well as with a higher temperature and a lower precipitation rate. Meteorological conditions of LIWs from the Iberian Peninsula and Greece are in agreement, although some differences possibly caused by the highly variable topography in Greece and a more humid environment are observed. These results show the possibility of using the typical meteorological and cloud conditions of LCC lightning flashes as proxy to parameterize the ignition of wildfires in atmospheric or forecasting models.

TI  - The radicalisation of rural resistance: How hunting counterpublics in the Nordic countries contribute to illegal hunting
PY  - 2015
AB  - Populist hunting movements have risen in recent years to safeguard rural interests against nature conservation. In extreme cases this movement has been accompanied by the illegal hunting of protected species. Using Sweden and Finland as a case study, the article elucidates how the perceived exclusion of hunters in the public debate on conservation mobilised this subculture toward resistance against regulatory agencies. Establishment of an alternative discursive platform comprising several ruralities - counterpublic in Negt and Kluge's original term - allowed hunters to publicise oppositional needs, interests and rationalities in the debate, and was a key juncture in their radicalisation trajectory. Finally the paper argues that failure to grant recognition to the counterpublic radicalised some individuals beyond counterpublic by engaging in illegal hunting. This practice is marked by the termination of political debate with society and represents a danger to political legitimacy.

TI  - Nuisance American alligators: an investigation into trends and public opinion
PY  - NA
AB  - The population rebound of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis; hereafter, alligator), with the rapid growth of populations throughout its range, has caused an influx of human-alligator conflicts. We quantified 5,838 nuisance alligator reports from 2000 to 2011 to develop more site-specific strategies of management and to determine where management should be focused to minimize the conflict. We also surveyed the general public's attitude toward and knowledge of alligators (n = 98) as a technique to better understand human dimensions of nuisance alligator management in Texas. Counties that received the largest numbers of nuisance alligator reports were Jefferson (16%), Fort Bend (14%), Matagorda (11%), Brazoria (10%), Harris (7%), Jackson (5%), Orange (5%), Chambers (5%), Calhoun (5%), and Liberty (3%) counties. We found that of the nuisance alligators reported, 45% were male, 18% were female, and 38% were reported as unknown. Most residential situations occurred in Fort Bend County, while more roadway and worksite situations occurred in Jefferson County, and more livestock depredation occurred in Matagorda County. Conflict resolution differed by alligator size. Most (41%) alligators 1.5 m in length were removed through lethal means. Most (93%) survey responders would support an alligator removal program that conducted capture and relocation, but they were unwilling to have alligators relocated near their homes. Only 15% of survey responders would support an alligator management program that utilized lethal removal. Visitors with more education (bachelor's degree or higher) were more willing to support lethal control of alligators. We determined that survey responders had some knowledge of alligators and that an alligator educational program targeted to residents of the northern Texas Gulf Coast could help reduce the number of human-alligator conflicts.

TI  - Change from agricultural to touristic use: Effects on the aesthetic value of landscapes over the last 150 years
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The demand for cultural ecosystem services (CES) is increasing, and aesthetic values contribute substantially to attract visitors to mountain regions, enhancing the socio-economic well-being. While most studies focused on the assessment of aesthetic values under current conditions, this study aimed to evaluate the historic development of aesthetic values from the perspective of today by analysing changes in the actual supply of this CES along roads and paths in Solden in the Otztal valley (Austria) since the beginning of tourism. We first mapped roads and paths for five time steps over the last 150 years to then estimate aesthetic values along these infrastructures, using a spatially explicit modelling approach. Furthermore, we compared spatial patterns of visitation preferences derived from social media data with predicted aesthetic values. Our results indicate that an increased access to areas of high aesthetic values was related to general increases in the supply of aesthetic values until 1950. Although the accessibility to high-elevation areas continued to increase until 2017, aesthetic values generally decreased due to landscape changes induced by the shift from mainly agricultural to touristic use. The abandonment of alpine pastures occurred mainly above the forest belt, which coincides with high levels of photo density, as most pictures were taken around mountain huts and on mountain peaks. If carefully planned and managed, mountain regions may actively enhance aesthetic experiences and foster the touristic use by providing good infrastructure, but land use policies and landscape management should support agricultural activities to maintain high levels of aesthetic values.

TI  - Northward range expansion in spring-staging barnacle geese is a response to climate change and population growth, mediated by individual experience.
PY  - 2019
AB  - All long‐distance migrants must cope with changing environments, but species differ greatly in how they do so. In some species, individuals might be able to adjust by learning from individual experiences and by copying others. This could greatly speed up the process of adjustment, but evidence from the wild is scarce. Here, we investigated the processes by which a rapidly growing population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) responded to strong environmental changes on spring‐staging areas in Norway. One area, Helgeland, has been the traditional site. Since the mid‐1990s, an increasing number of geese stage in another area 250 km further north, Vesteralen. We collected data on goose numbers and weather conditions from 1975 to 2017 to explore the extent to which the increase in population size and a warmer climate contributed to this change in staging area use. During the study period, the estimated onset of grass growth advanced on average by 0.54 days/year in each of the two areas. The total production of digestible biomass for barnacle geese during the staging period increased in Vesteralen but remained stable in Helgeland. The goose population has doubled in size during the past 25 years, with most of the growth being accommodated in Vesteralen. The observations suggest that this dramatic increase would not have happened without higher temperatures in Vesteralen. Records of individually marked geese indicate that from the initial years of colonization onwards, especially young geese tended to switch to Vesteralen, thereby predominating in the flocks at Vesteralen. Older birds had a lower probability of switching to Vesteralen, but over the years, the probability increased for all ages. Our findings suggest that barnacle geese integrate socially learned behaviour with adjustments to individual experiences, allowing the population to respond rapidly and accurately to global change.

TI  - Selection of Renewable Energy in Rural Area Via Life Cycle Assessment-Analytical Hierarchy Process (LCA-AHP): A Case Study of Tatau, Sarawak
PY  - 2021
AB  - With a growing global population and energy demand, there is increasing concern about the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, which have a negative impact on the climate, necessitating the immediate transition to a cleaner energy resource. This effort can be initiated in the rural areas of developing countries for a sustainable, efficient and affordable energy source. This study evaluated four types of renewable energy (solar, wind, biomass, and mini-hydro energy) using the integrated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approaches to select the best renewable energy source in Tatau, Sarawak. The criteria under consideration in this study included the environment, engineering and economics. The LCA was used to assess the environmental impact of renewable energies from gate-to-grave boundaries based on 50 MJ/day of electricity generation. The AHP results showed that solar energy received the highest score of 0.299 in terms of the evaluated criteria, followed by mini-hydro, biomass and wind energy, which received scores of 0.271, 0.230 and 0.200, respectively. These findings can be used to develop a systematic procedure for determining the best form of renewable energy for rural areas. This approach could be vital for the authorities that are responsible for breaking down multi-perspective criteria for future decision making in the transition into renewable energy.

TI  - Assessment of changes in forest coverage based on historical maps
PY  - 2008
AB  - <jats:title>Assessment of changes in forest coverage based on historical maps</jats:title> <jats:p>Forest has always been an important natural resource. Issues related to forest reserve, coverage area, distribution pattern and status have been important to the forest, nature protection, as well as to environment management specialists. The present studies have proved that it is not easy to find a clear and simple answer to the above-mentioned essential issues. The indicators of the importance of the forest coverage or the coverage area at a certain period of time depend on the applied assessment methodology, primary source used, etc. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the possibilities of using historical maps for studying the formation and changes of the forest coverage in the longer timely retrospect. The continuity of the forests and the possibilities of defining the variation of the areas covered with forest and open landscape were studied at the test area using the map material covering 150-year period (reference years were 1850, 1949 and 2002). The results of the analyses show that it is possible to reconstruct partially the formation of the forest in some areas and it is possible to define the areas, which have been covered with forests for tens or hundreds of years. It is possible to analyze from which land use classes the present forest community has been formed of and define the age of it. At the same time, several methodological questions arise in connection with the interpretation of the map information of the materials of the 19<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> century and definition of the term "forest". For example, one problematic issue is the vague definition of the class "<jats:italic>Buschland</jats:italic>" which in present terms could have at the time of mapping been either agricultural land or already a young forest. The comparison carried out at the test area showed that the coverage rate of the present forest areas with the areas covered with forests or such vague areas in 1850 is 75%.</jats:p>

AB  - OneRisk of the most common ways of considering ecological discomfortsEcological discomfort is in terms of riskRisk, which assesses the appropriateness of our distress by compiling the probabilityProbability and intensity of animal threat. Through a detailed textual analysis of the most common riskRisk discourses I show that the assessment of animal threats, even in these discourses, is not limited to the probabilityProbability and intensity of threat but involves also the meaning ofAnimalsmeaning of a threat—the role it plays in the context of wider cultural narratives or identitiesIdentity. In fact, nature writing is replete with intimations that ecological discomfortsEcological discomfort carry meanings that are crucial for establishing worthwhile connections to nature. Thus, while addressing the threats of nature in terms of risksRisk might seem rational, it nevertheless diminishes the significance of nature in human lives, consequently potentially diminishing concern for it. Examples of domains of life where ecological discomfortsDiscomfort play a crucial role are given. While it is not clear from the quoted material exactly why getting in touch with threatening nature is important, hermeneutic interpretationInterpretation of these texts promises to reveal the underlying meanings.

TI  - Les controverses socioécologiques entourant la protection du caribou en forêt boréale
PY  - 2020
AB  - Le caribou forestier est devenu un objet d’attention médiatique, notamment au sujet des mesures de protection qui soulèvent des enjeux d’acceptabilité sociale. Aux yeux des intervenants de la conservation et de plusieurs groupes sociaux, l’exploitation forestière dans les secteurs de la forêt boréale dont dépendent les hardes de caribous forestiers apparaît inacceptable. De l’autre côté, aux yeux du milieu de la foresterie, autant les acteurs industriels que les collectivités qui en dépendent économiquement, il semble tout aussi inacceptable de fragiliser les activités forestières industrielles pour la conservation de ces populations. En se basant sur la notion d’acceptabilité sociale, cette étude offre une analyse des débats associés à la protection du caribou forestier au Québec. À partir d’une revue de presse sur la question, nous présentons les arguments, justifications et mesures proposées par les acteurs en fonction des régimes de rationalité dans lesquels ils s’insèrent, de façon à dessiner les contours des questions d’acceptabilité sociale émergeant de cette controverse.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Changes and the Impacts of Climate Factors on Grassland in the Northern Songnen Plain (China)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Grassland is an important ecosystem; the spatiotemporal evolution trend of grassland and its impacts on climatic factors play an irreplaceable role in maintaining regional sustainable development and ecological balance. In this paper, based on the remote sensing images of 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, and 3S technology, we use the methods of dynamic rate and transfer matrix to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution trend of the northern Songnen Plain (China). The method of grey correlation is used to analyze the impact of climate factors on it. The results showed that the grassland changed dramatically and unevenly across the three periods of 1990–2000, 2000–2010, and 2010–2020, with the biggest change in the last period. The internal conversion of grassland mainly occurred between H-grassland (high coverage grassland) and M-grassland (medium coverage grassland), while the transformation rarely occurred in L-grassland (low coverage grassland) due to its small area. There has been a transfer-in from cultivated land, woodland, and unused land to H-grassland and M-grassland. The grassland transfer-out was mainly from H-grassland and M-grassland to cultivated land and unused land. What’s more, the transformation mainly occurred in Daqing City, Suihua City, Qiqihar city, as well as occurring in the west of Harbin and the southwest of Heihe city. Climate change has exacerbated the reduction of grassland areas. In summary, the spatiotemporal change rates of grassland area in the north of Songnen Plain initially showed a mild decrease and were then followed by a rapid decrease. Climate factors were of great significance to the spatiotemporal changes of grassland, and precipitation had a greater impact on the reduction of grassland. The results can provide meaningful information for grassland change, grassland protection, and management in the northern Songnen Plain.

TI  - Global life-cycle impacts of onshore wind-power plants on bird richness
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Wind energy development continues to expand rapidly to meet international climate targets. However, these developments impact biodiversity and associated sustainability targets negatively. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) predominately focus on site-specific impacts; failing to account for cumulative impacts at larger spatial scales. Life cycle assessments (LCA) can take such a holistic view, however models quantifying the main impact pathways on biodiversity are still lacking. To address this gap, we present a methodology to quantify habitat loss, disturbance and collision impacts of onshore wind power plants on bird biodiversity globally. By overlaying species ranges with wind-power plant locations, species-area relationships were used to calculate the potentially disappeared fraction of species (PDF) for the three impact pathways. Results revealed habitat-specific bird richness values, at order level, which were greatest in tropical and subtropical regions. Temporal changes in PDF were related to operationalizing wind-power plants. Despite similar PDF curves throughout the time period, disturbance and habitat loss had a greater effect compared to collisions. Annual energy production values strongly affected overall impacts for all impact pathways, which in turn differed between continents. When controlling for continent, bird order rather than country more strongly influenced variation in the pathway-specific PDF per GWh. Our approach represents the first step towards incorporating the impacts of wind power production in strategic environmental planning and the LCA framework. Failing to account for these negates an assessment of the trade-offs between biodiversity and energy production, and therefore the balancing of global sustainability goals.

TI  - Fire Dynamics in Boreal Forests Over the 20th Century: A Data-Model Comparison
PY  - 2021
AB  - Fire regimes across the world are expected to be altered by continuing variations in socio-economic conditions and climate. Current global fire-vegetation models are able to represent the present-day fire activity, but it is unclear how well they can simulate past or future scenarios. Here we use point estimates of sedimentary charcoal-based biomass burning reconstructions to evaluate fire probability and total carbon flux emitted to the atmosphere per year simulated by the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with its incorporated fire model SIMFIRE-BLAZE across the boreal region during the last century. The analyses were run for the whole time period, as well as for the intervals 1900-1950 CE and 1950-2000 CE. The data–model comparison for the 20th century reveals a general disagreement in trends between charcoal reconstructions (with decreasing or stable trends) and simulations (showing an overall increase) at both global (boreal forests) and continental scales (North America and Fennoscandia), as well as for most of the regional sub-areas (Canada, Norway and Sweden). The only exceptions are Alaska and Finland/Russia Karelia, where all the variables increase. Negative correlations between observations and model outputs are also recorded for the two different sub-periods, except for Alaska and North America during the time interval 1900-1950 CE, and Norway and Finland/Russia Karelia between 1950 and 2000 CE. Despite several uncertainties in charcoal records, main differences between modelled and observed fire activity are probably due to limitations in the representation of the human impact on fire regime (especially connected to forest management and landscape fragmentation) in the model simulations.

TI  - Social factors mediating human–carnivore coexistence: Understanding thematic strands influencing coexistence in Central Romania
PY  - 2016
AB  - Facilitating human-carnivore coexistence depends on the biophysical environment but also on social factors. Focusing on Central Romania, we conducted 71 semi-structured interviews to explore human-bear (Ursus arctos) coexistence. Qualitative content and discourse analysis identified three socially mediated thematic strands, which showed different ways in which perceived interactions between people, bears and the environment shape coexistence. The "landscape-bear strand" described perceptions of the way in which the landscape offers resources for the bear, while the "landscape-human strand" related to ways in which humans experience the landscape. The "management strand" related to the way bears was managed. All three strands highlight both threats and opportunities for the peaceful coexistence of people and bears. Management and policy interventions could be improved by systematically considering the possible effects of interventions on each of the three strands shaping coexistence. Future research should explore the relevance of the identified thematic strands in other settings worldwide.

TI  - Addressing the Swedish Large Carnivore Controversy: Identifying Roadblocks in Collaborative Governance to Reduce Conflict
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>In Europe, and many places throughout the world, the return, and preservation of large carnivores is escalating tensions between stakeholder groups, as well as between local actors and authorities. In Sweden, despite policies aimed at reducing conflict surrounding wildlife management, tensions seem to have intensified. This research investigates the collaborative governance model within Swedish wildlife management and what dampens the capacity to reduce ongoing tensions. In-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders at different levels of wildlife management. Through an abductive approach combining empirical data from interviews and theories from the human-wildlife conflict and collaborative governance literature, we problematize the role of regional wildlife managers in this multilevel governance context, in exploration of ways to advance collaboration. Our model analyzes the challenges for wildlife managers to implement government policies based on broad international conventions while remaining accountable to local concerns. The results reveal that issues within the governance structure and relationships within management in terms of lack of legitimacy, trust, and participation, need to be addressed to create a socially viable collaborative governance regime capable of managing conflict.</jats:p>

TI  - Human and environmental associates of local species-specific abundance in a multi-species deer assemblage
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding how habitat, landscape context, and human disturbance influence local species-specific deer density provides evidence informing strategic management of increasing deer populations. Across an extensive (187 km2) heterogeneous forest-mosaic landscape in eastern England, spatially explicit density surface models of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and introduced muntjac Muntiacus reevesi were calibrated by thermal imaging distance sampling (recording 1590 and 400 muntjac and roe deer groups, respectively, on 567 km of driven transects). Models related deer density to local habitat composition, recreational intensity, and deer density (roe deer models controlled for muntjac density and vice versa) at a local grain across 1162 composite transect segments, incorporating geographical coordinates accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Abundance of both species was lower in localities with more grasslands (inter-quartile, IQ, effect size: roe −2.9 deer/km2; muntjac −2.9 deer/km2). Roe abundance (mean = 7 deer/km2, SD = 6) was greater in localities with more young stands (IQ effect size, + 1.3 deer/km2) and lower at localities with more recreationists (−1.1 deer/km2). Muntjac density (mean = 21 deer/km2, SD = 10) was greater in localities with more recreationists (+ 2.4 deer/km2), with more mature (≥ 46 years) stands (+ 1.5 deer/km2), or calcareous soil (+ 7.1 deer/km2). Comparison of models incorporating candidate variables and models comprising geographical coordinates only shows candidate variables to be weak predictors of deer densities. Adapting forest management to manipulate habitat and recreational access may influence local deer densities, but only subtly: effect sizes are not sufficient to mitigate deer impacts through planting vulnerable tree crops in areas avoided by deer. Effective culling remains the most viable management option.

TI  - Introduction: Silent Spring, Raucous Summer, and the Looming Winter of Our Discontent
PY  - 2019
AB  - After centuries of persecutions, successful restoration and rewilding projects allow many wildlife species to begin their road to recovery. As a consequence, wild animals are spreading across Europe, often entering places in which they have long been absent, confronting the inhabitants of urban and rural areas with the need to learn to coexist. While thanks to the support of the environmental movement people are better able to appreciate the benefits of this situation, cohabitation brings its own difficulties—for the first time in many decades people of highly industrialized countries are directly confronted with the agency of wild animals, which often proves disruptive of the established ways of life. As a consequence, the arrival of animals often provokes ambivalent feelings. Thus, rewilding creates a situation in which we are forced to reflect on whether we are willing, or even able, to coexist with such unruly wild agents. From environmentalists and environmental philosophers this requires more attention to the difficult, disturbing, and discomforting aspects of engagement with the non-human world, particularly to how the ambivalent attitude towards nature can be integrated with nature protection and how it stands in relation to the ongoing attempts to promote pro-environmental attitudes.

TI  - Land registers as a source of studying long-term land-use changes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Land registers, or cadasters, contain information on land use because this is vital for land assessment and taxation. Some European countries produced land registers covering their entire territories as early as the nineteenth century. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Habsburg Monarchy produced the Franciscean Cadaster, also known as the Stable Cadaster, which shows the traditional preindustrial cultural landscape and makes it possible to analyze land-use changes or the transformation of the traditional cultural landscape. This special issue is the result of collaboration between Slovenian and Czech geographers, and it features six articles covering land-use changes from the perspective of natural geography, political geography, ecosystems, farms, and metrics. The articles, which explore the processes of changes at the national and regional levels, are based on the textual part of the Franciscan Cadaster, and the local studies are based on the cartographic part of the cadaster.

TI  - Mitigation of bark stripping on spruce: the need for red deer population control
PY  - 2020
AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is a major production tree species for the European wood industry. However, it is highly sensitive to bark stripping (BS) by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), which causes large timber losses. Because the red deer population has increased over the last decades, a better understanding of the underlying causes driving BS is urgently needed. BS outbreaks are multifactorial: winter food shortage, local and regional deer abundance and stand properties (thermal and visual cover, and scarcity of herbaceous layers) have been found to drive BS rates. Although the influence of each of these factors is well studied, there is still no consensus on their relative contributions to BS or what mitigation strategy is best. In this study, we made use of a long-term, large-scale BS inventory (13 years over 2570 km2) to fill these gaps. We modeled winter and summer BS rates in response to the most explanatory variables, selected from a large set of environmental variables. Our results highlight the prevalence of deer abundance combined with high sensitivity of coniferous thickets and pronounced habitat selection by deer for these stands. Our findings show that the control of red deer populations is a key measure for reducing BS in Norway spruce stands.

TI  - Complexities of conflict: the importance of considering social factors for effectively resolving human–wildlife conflict
PY  - 2010
AB  - Human–wildlife conflict is one of the most critical threats facing many wildlife species today, and the topic is receiving increasing attention from conservation biologists. Direct wildlife damage is commonly cited as the main driver of conflict, and many tools exist for reducing such damage. However, significant conflict often remains even after damage has been reduced, suggesting that conflict requires novel, comprehensive approaches for long-term resolution. Although most mitigation studies investigate only the technical aspects of conflict reduction, peoples' attitudes towards wildlife are complex, with social factors as diverse as religious affiliation, ethnicity and cultural beliefs all shaping conflict intensity. Moreover, human–wildlife conflicts are often manifestations of underlying human–human conflicts, such as between authorities and local people, or between people of different cultural backgrounds. Despite evidence that social factors can be more important in driving conflict than wildlife damage incurred, they are often ignored in conflict studies. Developing a broader awareness of conflict drivers will advance understanding of the patterns and underlying processes behind this critical conservation issue. In this paper, I review a wide variety of case studies to show how social factors strongly influence perceptions of human–wildlife conflict, and highlight how mitigation approaches should become increasingly innovative and interdisciplinary in order to enable people to move from conflict towards coexistence.

TI  - Sharing the same slope: Behavioral responses of a threatened mesocarnivore to motorized and nonmotorized winter recreation.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Winter recreation is a widely popular activity and is expected to increase due to changes in recreation technology and human population growth. Wildlife are frequently negatively impacted by winter recreation, however, through displacement from habitat, alteration of activity patterns, or changes in movement behavior. We studied impacts of dispersed and developed winter recreation on Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) at their southwestern range periphery in Colorado, USA. We used GPS collars to track movements of 18 adult lynx over 4 years, coupled with GPS devices that logged 2,839 unique recreation tracks to provide a detailed spatial estimate of recreation intensity. We assessed changes in lynx spatial and temporal patterns in response to motorized and nonmotorized recreation, as well as differences in movement rate and path tortuosity. We found that lynx decreased their movement rate in areas with high-intensity back-country skiing and snowmobiling, and adjusted their temporal patterns so that they were more active at night in areas with high-intensity recreation. We did not find consistent evidence of spatial avoidance of recreation: lynx exhibited some avoidance of areas with motorized recreation, but selected areas in close proximity to nonmotorized recreation trails. Lynx appeared to avoid high-intensity developed ski resorts, however, especially when recreation was most intense. We conclude that lynx in our study areas did not exhibit strong negative responses to dispersed recreation, but instead altered their behavior and temporal patterns in a nuanced response to recreation, perhaps to decrease direct interactions with recreationists. However, based on observed avoidance of developed recreation, there may be a threshold of human disturbance above which lynx cannot coexist with winter recreation.

TI  - Boreal tree species change as a climate mitigation strategy: impact on ecosystem C and N stocks and soil nutrient levels
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To increase the annual uptake of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as well as the long‐term storage of carbon (C) in forests, the Norwegian government consider large‐scale replacements of native, deciduous forests with faster‐growing species like Norway spruce. To assess the effects of tree species change on ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) stocks and soil chemistry, we used a paired plot approach including stands of native downy birch and planted 45‐ to 60‐yr‐old Norway spruce. The birch stands were used as reference for the assessment of differences following the tree species change. We found significantly higher C and N stocks in living tree biomass in the spruce stands, whereas no significant differences were found for dead wood. The cover of understory species groups, and the C and N stocks of the aboveground understory vegetation were significantly higher in the birch stands. The tree species change did not affect the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock down to 1 m soil depth; however, the significantly higher stock in the forest floor of the spruce stands suggested a re‐distribution of SOC within the profile. There was a significant positive correlation between the SOC stock down to 30 cm soil depth and the total ecosystem C stock for the birch stands, and a negative correlation for the spruce stands. Significant effects of tree species change were found for C and N concentrations, C/N, exchangeable acidity, base saturation, and exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, Na, S, and Fe in the organic horizon or the upper mineral soil layer. The total ecosystem C stock ranged between 197 and 277 Mg/ha for the birch stands, and 297 and 387 Mg/ha for the spruce stands. The ecosystem C accumulation varied between 32 and 142 Mg/ha over the past 45–60 yr, whereas the net ecosystem C capture was considerably lower and potentially negative. Our results suggest that the potential to meet the governments' targets to increase C sequestration depend on the C debt incurred from the removed birch stands, the rotation length, and potentially also the susceptibility of the different stand types to future risk factors related to climate change.</jats:p>

TI  - Smartphone app reveals that lynx avoid human recreationists on local scale, but not home range scale.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Outdoor recreation is increasing and affects habitat use and selection by wildlife. These effects are challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation affects habitat selection at the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We fitted resource selection functions at the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation. Scale-dependent responses and temporal adjustments in habitat use may facilitate coexistence between humans and large carnivores.

TI  - Fire facilitates warming-induced upward shifts of alpine treelines by altering interspecific interactions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Moderate-severity fire disturbances can accelerate upslope shifts of alpine treelines by reducing interspecific interactions, providing additional evidence for the species interaction mechanism in controlling treeline dynamics. Biotic interactions between trees and other plants may modulate the responses of alpine treelines to climate. Moderate disturbances could, therefore, accelerate upward shifts of alpine treelines as the climate warms by reducing the coverage of competitor plants and resetting interspecific interactions. Larch (Larix potaninii var. macrocarpa) treelines disturbed by fire on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau are good locales for testing this hypothesis. We characterized treelines in five large rectangular plots spanning undisturbed and fire-disturbed fir (Abies georgei) and larch treelines. The fires in the 1960s caused gaps in the reconstructed age structures of the larches during the 1970s but did not lead to downslope shifts in treeline position. Recruitment has instead increased since the 1980s within the disturbed larch treelines, with treelines shifting upward by 11–44 m. In contrast, the undisturbed larch and fir treeline positions remained mostly unchanged. We hypothesize that upslope shifts of alpine treelines are likely a consequence of climatic warming, but fire disturbances can accelerate these dynamics by altering interspecific interactions.

TI  - Edaphic arthropods as indicators of the ecological condition of temperate grassland ecosystems: A systematic review
PY  - 2022
AB  - Temperate grasslands are part of one of the biggest biomes on earth, sustaining high levels of biodiversity and providing multiple ecosystem services. However, the area covered by this open ecosystem is decreasing worldwide, due to several threats like land use change or climate change. Ground-dwelling arthropods are an important group of the community of grassland soil invertebrates, and they play a key role within this ecosystem, while at the same time being sensitive to the changes caused by management practices like grazing, mowing, prescribed fire, etc. Using the Web of Science database, we conducted a systematic review to identify which groups of arthropods are being used as indicators to evaluate the ecological condition of grasslands in temperate regions, and which indices are being measured. As grasslands have been traditionally managed by humans for centuries, their ecological condition is intrinsically linked to the development of different management practices like grazing, mowing or restoration strategies, which usually affect soil and vegetation structure. We found that macro-arthropods were used in a greater number of studies than micro-arthropods (91% vs 15%), and within that size group, beetles were the preferred indicator in most of the temperate grassland types (49% of the studies), followed by spiders and ants. Few studies used grasshoppers to monitor grasslands changes. The indices more frequently assessed were species richness and abundance, and we identified that the response to the different management practices was quite heterogeneous. Restoration and grazing effects were the two factors more frequently evaluated for macro-arthropods, while micro-arthropods (Acari and Collembola) were dominant to assess land use type. Overall, our findings highlight the need to increase the number of studies in some temperate regions, to explore the potential of overlooked groups of arthropods, and to include indices that measure functional diversity or community composition.

TI  - Responses of remnant wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain to farming-landscape patterns
PY  - 2022
AB  - Human activities, especially cultivated-land reclamation, substantially influence landscape patterns. This phenomenon leads to a sharp decrease in wetland areas and wetland function degradation. To understand the impact of changing landscape patterns of the cultivated land on remnant wetland degradation and to formulate highly targeted control measures, considering a farmland-wetland mosaic landscape in the Sanjiang Plain as an example, this study explored the response of soil- and vegetation-related indicators of remnant wetlands under the influence of changing cultivated land patterns. Correlations between cultivated land patterns and soil- and vegetation-indicators in different buffer zones of remnant wetland sample points were discussed. On the basis of modeling an index of the integrated degradation degree of remnant wetlands (IDRWs) using soil- and vegetation-indicators, the correlation between cultivated land patterns and IDRW was analysed. The results showed that: 1) five soil-related indexes of remnant wetlands were lower than those of natural wetlands, and nine vegetation-related indexes of remnant wetlands were higher than those of natural wetlands; 2) the variation in soil- and vegetarian-related indexes caused by changing cultivated land patterns in a certain range of remnant wetlands was significant (P < 0.05) and these indexes could potentially be used as variables to model IDRW; and 3) the aggregation degree of wetland patches was the main landscape index for IDRW simulation (from 1995 to 2015, the proportion of serious degradation of the Sanjiang Plain wetland first decreased in 2010 and then increased, and that of slight degradation first increased in 2010 and then decreased, indicating that wetland protection and restoration plans have shown progress after 2010). Our study discussed the impacts of cultivated land patterns on remnant wetland degradation and developed a simulation method of degraded remnant wetlands to provide a reference for the wetland protection, restoration, degradation monitoring, and reclamation planning for the cultivated lands in the future.

TI  - Body condition, diet and ecosystem function of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in a fenced nature reserve
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Body condition, as a sign of animal welfare, is of management concern in rewilding projects where fenced animals are subject to winter starvation, which may conflict with animal welfare legislation. Investigating the relationship between body condition, age, sex, diet quality and diet composition is therefore relevant to increase understanding of herbivores' ecosystem function and to inform management. In this study, we focused on red deer, Cervus elaphus , in a fenced nature reserve in Denmark, where the deer are managed as ecosystem engineers to contribute to biodiversity conservation. We measured body mass and body size of 91 culled red deer, and determined diet composition using DNA metabarcoding and diet quality using fecal nitrogen on 246 fecal samples. We found that body condition was predicted by age and diet composition, but not diet quality. We also found that individuals of different body condition had different diets, i.e., the fecal samples of red deer in poorer body condition contained significantly more Ericaceae sequences than red deer in good body condition. This may imply that certain functions of red deer in ecosystems, such as regeneration of heather by grazing, may depend on variation in body condition within the population. Our findings call for the need to consider the consequences of management practices, including culling or supplemental feeding, on the outcomes of habitat restoration, and more broadly underline the importance of preserving the overall breath of herbivore ecosystem functions for effective biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Communicating for conservation : circumventing conflict with communities over domestic dog ownership in north Morocco.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Conservationists consider open and direct communication as best practice even when their data conflict with local beliefs. However, ensuring the effective delivery of a controversial message without overtly challenging community identity is difficult. Such a scenario needs high levels of meaningful contact and trust-building dialogue between conservationists and communities as well as innovative means of communicating controversial information. Indirect communication is one such strategy, allowing people to draw their own conclusions about controversial information. We present an example of successful indirect communication of such information in the context of a long-term Barbary macaque community conservation project in Morocco. Dogs in the area kill macaques and domestic livestock in the forest, and local shepherds believed these dogs to be feral. However, our observations identified these dogs as being owned, free-roaming village dogs rather than feral dogs. To impart this controversial information, we developed a dog health programme to communicate our findings and improve the health of domestic dogs to safeguard human and animal health. We administered rabies vaccinations to dogs in three villages and provided their owners with brightly coloured dog collars. After observing collared dogs hunting in the forest, the shepherds realised the dogs had owners. Community participation was high and we vaccinated 242 dogs achieving 60–81% vaccination coverage. An additional benefit of the activity was to successfully convey the message that the conservation team is committed to local people’s welfare as well as to Barbary macaque conservation.

AB  - The remnant population of Balkan lynx Lynx lynx martinoi is small, isolated and highly threatened. Since 2006 a conservation project has surveyed its status and promoted its recovery in Albania and Macedonia. Eurasian lynx are often associated with conflicts of an economic or social nature, and their conservation requires a focus on the people sharing the landscape with the species. In this study we adopt methods and conceptual frameworks from anthropology to explore the local knowledge and perceptions of lynx among rural hunters and livestock breeders in the western moun- tains of the Republic of Macedonia in south-east Europe. The main finding was that local people rarely saw or interacted with lynx. As the level of interactions with this species is very low, the lynx doesn't appear to be a species associated with conflicts in Macedonia. There was also a general lack of both scientific and local knowledge, which has led to somewhat negative attitudes, mainly based on myths and rumours. Poaching of lynx and their prey seem to be the main barriers to lynx conservation.

TI  - Interests, Costs, Benefits, and the Social Complexity of Discomforts
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is commonly used to assess the desirability of living with wildlife. This framing usually presents ecological discomforts as pure negatives that are, however, often sufficiently balanced out by positive utilities that wildlife bring with them, mostly in the form of ecosystem services. However, in the context of CBA, it is often argued that certain animal threats can be re-interpreted as benefits. This is associated with the ‘risk is fun’ culture, where limited and controlled threats benefit individual self-realization by providing psychological stimulation and opportunities for testing ones virility, which are often lacking in the modern comfort and safety oriented culture. While this interpretation goes some way towards explaining the positive role of ecological discomforts, it delimits the role of animals as tools for human self-realization, wholly integrated within the perpetuation of the established culture and identities. Meanwhile, there are strong indications that discomforting animals are also important in moral sense, as partners who question, negate and undermine our identities and dominant cultural patterns, and as entities demanding respect in their own right.

TI  - Water scarcity footprint of hydropower based on a seasonal approach - Global assessment with sensitivities of model assumptions tested on specific cases.
PY  - 2020
AB  - According to ISO 14046 the quantification of the water scarcity footprint (WSFP) of hydropower reservoirs has to consider (1) the evaporation of water from the surface of the reservoir, (2) the baseline evaporation of water of the same area before the reservoir has been built, and (3) the water scarcity index of the location of the reservoir on a spatially and temporally explicit level.When a reservoir has a storing function, e.g., for irrigation in the dry season, monthly water scarcity indexes have to be used in order to calculate the WSFP, since storage in wet seasons and release in dry seasons can counteract water scarcity and lead to a reduction of overall water scarcity in the watershed.This paper builds on previous research regarding detailed hydropower modeling and extends the water scarcity assessment to include and advance new methods for identifying sensitivities in monthly WSFP of hydropower due to the choice of impact assessment methods. We applied the global analysis to 1473 hydropower plants covering >100 countries, and added a detailed assessment for a subset of important power plants to discuss the limitations of global assessments. We thereby provide the most complete WSFP of global hydropower with state-of-the-art methods, assess the robustness of the global model and different methodological choices, and provide new monthly average AWARE CFs on watershed level.The results show that water scarcity can often be mitigated if the net evaporation is compensated by the storage effects. The two water scarcity metrics applied lead to larger differences than expected, since the monthly dynamics of dams can lead to stronger differences than the differences in the applied water scarcity factors. The new insights help to better understand the WSFP of hydropower and its uncertainties.

TI  - Afforested farmland vs. forestland: Effects of bark stripping by Cervus elaphus and climate on production potential and structure of Picea abies forests.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) effects of bark stripping and climatic factors on radial growth of Picea abies /L./ Karst., (2) production and structural differences between stands established on the forestland and abandoned farmland (afforested farmland-henceforth, farmland), and (3) interaction among the losses caused by ungulate damages, production, diversity, and soil types. Data acquired from four permanent research plots (PRPs) located on the forestland and eight PRPs on the farmland were used. A number of tree- and stand-level models, stand structural indices, tree-rings, and climate characteristics were analysed to evaluate the hypotheses. The results show significantly higher means of DBH, tree height and basal area on the forestland compared to those on the farmland. There was a larger mean standing stem volume on the forestland (466 m3 ha-1) compared to farmland (770 m3 ha-1). Significant difference was observed between the mean DBH and mean stem volume of healthy trees compared to those of the trees with substantial damage (girth damage >1/3 of stem circumference). A greater extent of the girth damage was found on 86% trees on the farmland, while 54% damage on the forestland. About 62% bark-strip damage was further deteriorated by rot infection on the farmland, while on the forestland such an infection was only for 39% trees. The precipitation significantly positively affected the radial growth of trees that were largely affected by ungulate damages on the farmland.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of crop damage caused by geese, swans and cranes-Implications for crop damage prevention
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract European populations of geese, swans and cranes have increased considerably since the 1970s raising conflicts between conservation and farming interests. Crop damage caused by geese, swans and cranes across the national scale needs a trans-boundary approach that captures the site-specific characteristics of crop damage at a more refined spatial scale, to deal with the high spatio-temporal variation inherent in the system and to avoid conflict displacement. In the present study we use long-term crop damage data (2000–2015) in Sweden to evaluate seasonal and annual patterns of crop damage. We show that crop damage increased over years but followed a fairly consistent seasonal pattern during the later parts of the study period. We show how these seasonal patterns differ across the country such that trans-boundary regions with similar patterns of crop damage, relating to different nuisance species and damaged crops, can be identified. These findings about spatio-temporal variation of damage can be used to find appropriate scales of management units (e.g. areas with similar conditions), and to adapt damage mitigation strategies to temporal and spatial-specific conditions, e.g. guidance of when and where certain crop may be suitable as sacrificial crops.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of human–fire interactions on the Navajo Nation
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Unraveling the effects of climate and land use on historical fire regimes provides important insights into broader human–fire–climate dynamics, which are necessary for ecologically based forest management. We developed a spatial human land‐use model for Navajo Nation forests across which we sampled a network of tree‐ring fire history sites to reflect contrasting historical land‐use intensity: high human use, primarily in the Chuska Mountains, and low human use, primarily on the central Defiance Plateau. We tested for and compared human‐ and climate‐driven changes in the fire regimes by applying change point detection, regression, and superposed epoch analyses. The historical fire regimes and fire–climate relationships reflect those of similar forests regionally and are similar between the two Navajo landscapes until the early 1800s. We then determined that a previously identified, localized, early (1830s) decline in fire activity was geographically widespread across higher human‐use sites. In contrast, fires continued to burn uninterrupted through this period at the lower use sites. Though the 1830s included significantly wet and cold periods that could have contributed to fire regime decline, human factors pose a more spatiotemporally consistent explanation. A rise in Navajo pastoralism in the 1820s–1830s was concentrated seasonally in the heavy use sites. By the 1880s, livestock numbers more than doubled, grazing became far more spatially widespread, and frequent fire regimes of Navajo forests collapsed. The last widespread fire recorded on either landscape was in 1886. In the Chuska Mountains, livestock and fire coexisted for over 50 yr between the initial 1832 fire decline and the end of frequent fires after 1886, an exceptional pattern in the western United States. Though unique in its timing, character, and spatial dynamics, the collapse of historical fire regimes in Navajo forests contributed to now over a century without frequent surface fire, leaving Navajo forests at risk for large, uncharacteristic high‐severity fires.</jats:p>

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Fire Rate of Spread Models in Northern-European Calluna vulgaris Heathlands
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Land-use, climate, and policy changes have impacted the fire regimes of many landscapes across northern Europe. Heathlands in oceanic climates are globally important ecosystems that have experienced an increase in the prevalence of destructive wildfire. Many of these landscapes are also managed using traditional prescribed burning that enhances their structural diversity and agricultural productivity. The changing role of wild and managed fire highlights a necessity to better understand the performance of fire behaviour prediction models for these ecosystems to support sustainable fire risk management. Our research evaluates the outputs of several empirical and quasi-empirical prediction models, as well as their varying software implementations, against observations of fire behaviour. The Rothermel model and its implementations predict rates of spread with similar accuracy to baseline empirical models and provide tolerable estimates of observed fire rate of spread. The generic shrubland empirical model developed by Anderson et al. consistently overpredicts observed rates of spread for prescribed burns in target fuel structures, but its predictions otherwise have a strong correlation with observed spread rate. A range of empirical models and software tools thus appear appropriate to assist managers who wish to evaluate potential fire behaviour and assess risk in heathland landscapes.</jats:p>

TI  - Driving Factors of the Health and Wellness Tourism Industry: A Sharing Economy Perspective Evidence from KPK Pakistan
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the recent years, the health and wellness tourism industry has become one of the new emerging industries in Pakistan. In terms of the sharing economy, the driving mechanism of the health and wellness tourism industry has undergone significant changes. Based on a combination of theoretical and practical research, the paper explores the dynamic system and mechanism of innovation development of health and wellness in the tourism industry in Pakistan. Firstly, it theoretically constructs the driving factors in four aspects, which include market demand, industrial supply, infrastructure, and external environment. Secondly, taking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KPK) as an example, it uses the entropy method and Grey relational analysis to test the driving factors system. The empirical results show that four aspects jointly influence the innovation of the health and wellness tourism industry in Pakistan. Finally, this study discusses several practical implications for the development of the health and wellness tourism industry of KPK for academics, policymakers, business owners, and scholars, with recommendations for future research.

TI  - Large carnivores and zoos as catalysts for engaging the public in the protection of biodiversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Addressing the biodiversity crisis requires renewed collaborative approaches. Large carnivores are ambassador species, and as such they can aid the protection of a wide range of species, including evolutionarily distinct and threatened ones, while being popular for conservation marketing. However, conflicts between carnivores and people present a considerable challenge to biodiversity conservation. Our cross disciplinary essay brings together original research to discuss key issues in the conservation of large carnivores as keystone species for biodiversity rich, healthy ecosystems. Our findings suggest the need to promote coexistence through challenging ‘wilderness’ myths; to consider coexistence/conflict as a continuum; to include varied interest groups in decision making; to address fear through positive mediated experiences, and to explore further partnerships with zoos. As wide-reaching institutions visited by over 700 million people/year worldwide, zoos combine knowledge, emotion and social context creating ideal conditions for the development of care towards nature, pro-environmental behaviors and long-term connections between visitors and carnivores. Based on current research, we provide evidence that large carnivores and zoos are both powerful catalysts for public engagement with biodiversity conservation, recognizing barriers and suggesting future ways to collaborate to address biodiversity loss.

TI  - Sensory and emotional dimensions of domesticating new technology: an experiment with new e-bike users in Norway
PY  - 2023
AB  - Cities face major challenges when it comes to sustainability and mobility. Transport’s contribution to climate change is well-established, and people need to move in the most sustainable way to reach the 2030 emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement. One possible pathway towards more sustainable mobility practices is electromobility. The electrification of micro-mobility is happening rapidly, and one of the most popular is the e-bike. For years, electric bikes were relegated to niche status, but they are now experiencing explosive growth in sales in many countries. In this article, we draw on an experiment with new users of e-bikes to study the integration of e-bikes into existing mobility practices and to explore their sustainability potential. Through the lens of domestication theory, we zoom in on the relations that formed between users, technology, and environments in the course of the experiment. Our analysis highlights how emotional and sensory experiences play crucial roles in the adaption of new mobility technologies. Based on our findings, we argue that to reach the sustainability potential of e-bikes, a set of support mechanisms must be developed according to a holistic and relational understanding of mobility that also takes emotions and sensory experiences into consideration.

TI  - Post-fire carbon and nitrogen accumulation and succession in Central Siberia.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Improved understanding of carbon (C) accumulation after a boreal fire enables more accurate quantification of the C implications caused by potential fire regime shifts. We coupled results from a fire history study with biomass and soil sampling in a remote and little-studied region that represents a vast area of boreal taiga. We used an inventory approach based on predefined plot locations, thus avoiding problems potentially causing bias related to the standard chronosequence approach. The disadvantage of our inventory approach is that more plots are needed to expose trends. Because of this we could not expose clear trends, despite laborious sampling. We found some support for increasing C and nitrogen (N) stored in living trees and dead wood with increasing time since the previous fire or time since the previous stand-replacing fire. Surprisingly, we did not gain support for the well-established paradigm on successional patterns, beginning with angiosperms and leading, if fires are absent, to dominance of Picea. Despite the lack of clear trends in our data, we encourage fire historians and ecosystem scientists to join forces and use even larger data sets to study C accumulation since fire in the complex Eurasian boreal landscapes.

TI  - Cultural values and forest dynamics: The Italian forests in the last 150 years
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract In the context of the worldwide increasing interest on the role of forests for global warming and biodiversity targets, there is a growing tendency to consider the need to increase not only the extension of forests, but also their degree of naturalness. These indications have been recently included also in important political documents such as the European Green Deal enacted by the European Union, affecting 28 member states of the European continent, also with the aim of fighting deforestation and desertification. In Italy national and regional forest inventories, as well as planning documents, classify more and more forests as natural or seminatural. These indications often result in the limitation of traditional silvicultural methods, by environmental and landscape restrictions, orienting forest management towards favoring more natural forests structures. These policies are often threatening the conservation of the cultural features of the Italian forests. The paper provides an analysis of the evolution of forests in Italy during the last 150 years through official forest inventories and various investigations. This study shows that from 4.215.000 ha of forest in 1888 we have today about 11.778.000 ha, with an increase of 7.563.000 ha and an annual growth rate of 59.551 ha. The present Italian forests can be described partly as derived from those already mapped in 1936 and entirely managed, although not regularly, and secondary forests developed on abandoned land, extending for 5.279.895 ha. The results show that human influence has affected extension, density, structure and species composition of Italian forests in all the geographical areas of the country, independently from altitude, latitude or climate conditions. There are no dangers of deforestation, but rather an uncontrolled increase of forests and there is no need of further afforestation but rather to better manage the existing ones. Moreover, “cultural forests”, meaning forest shaped and managed by human activities through times, are more and more reducing their extensions together with the material and immaterial heritage associated to them. Considering the third pillar of Sustainable Forest Management in Europe, the one on “social and cultural values”, defined by MCPFE in 2003, the paper proposes the definition of “cultural forests” as a new category in forest conservation and an important part of the biocultural heritage associated to the rural territory. Furthermore, the paper stresses the need of historical investigations, for the better understanding of the features of the forest ecosystems and for the identification of the values to be considered in forest restoration.

TI  - Media's portrayal of large predators in Norway from the protection by law in the 1970's till today: an insight into local and national newspapers
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the late century of 1800 till mid-1900s, large predators were eradicated worldwide, and bounties were commonly used to get rid of the predators. In the twentieth century the policy changed, and predators became protected by law. The “return” of the predators has resulted in negative human–wildlife interactions and an increase in social conflicts. Media plays a key role in most social conflicts, as positive portrayals can lead to an increased willingness to conserve the species, as opposed to negative portrayals. We have looked at how Norwegian newspapers portray the large predators from when they were protected by law in the 1970’s till today. Our results show that wolves represent the most articles, and the positive mentioning of wolves has decreased, while for bears this has increased. Local newspapers contained more negative portrayals than national newspapers, and changes in wolf establishment, predator management or politics impact on the number of articles. As our findings indicate that negative experiences with predators, in particular in local areas, associate with negative articles in the local newspapers, we believe this could contribute to negative attitudes towards predators among those who are readers of the local newspapers. This is yet to be studied in more detail and would be recommended to better understand the role of media in human–wildlife conflicts.</jats:p>

TI  - Anthropogenic use of fire led to degraded scots pine-lichen forest in northern Sweden
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Northern pine-lichen forests are generally regarded as natural ecosystems that, in the past, were repeatedly affected by wild fires. This paper presents and tests a new hypothesis that reindeer herders used recurrent fires to promote and sustain reindeer lichen-dominated ground vegetation, in order to maintain good winter-grazing grounds in Scots pine forests. We investigated vegetation and fire history in three pine-lichen forests along the Lulealven River in northernmost Sweden. Methods included analyses of pollen, spores, charcoal and soil nutrient capital, coupled with investigation of written historical sources and previous studies. Results suggest that recurrent, intermediate-interval fires started sometime between the 2nd and 8th centuries CE, i.e. at the same time that reindeer became semi-domesticated in this region. Such fires continued until the 18th century, when introduction of active fire suppression reduced the occurrence of fire in the landscape. Repeated burning over this long period eventually depleted the soil-nutrient capital, especially nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby severely reducing productivity. In the early 20th century, foresters described such forests as degraded. Results of this study add a new dimension to understanding the genesis and history of many pine-lichen forests. They challenge the notion that reindeer herders have been reluctant, in the past, to use fire. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether a similar history can be ascribed to pine-lichen forests in other parts of northern Fennoscandia.

TI  - Empirical characterization factors assessing the effects of hydroelectricity on fish richness across three large biomes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Hydroelectricity is often presented as a clean, reliable, and renewable energy source, but is also recognized for its potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem biodiversity. We used empirical data on change in fish species richness following impoundment to develop Characterisation Factors (CF) and Impact Scores (IS) for hydroelectricity production for use in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). We used data collected on 89 sampling stations (63 upstream and 26 downstream of a dam) belonging to 27 reservoirs from three biomes (boreal, temperate and tropical). Overall, the impact of hydroelectricity production on fish species richness was significant in the tropics, of smaller amplitude in temperate and minimal in boreal biome, stressing for the need of regionalisation. The impact of hydroelectricity production was also quite consistent across scales (i.e., same directionality and statistical significance across sampling stations, reservoirs and biomes) but was sensitive to the duration of the study (i.e., the period over which data have been collected after impoundment), highlighting the need for a clear understanding of transient situations before reaching steady states. Our CFs and ISs contribute to fill a gap to assist decision makers using LCA to evaluate alternative technologies, such as hydropower, to decarbonize the worldwide economy.nnHighlightsO_LIThis paper is the first to develop global and empirically based characterization factors of the impact of hydroelectricity production on aquatic ecosystems biodiversity, to be used in LCA;nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish species richness was significant in the tropics, of smaller amplitude in temperate and minimal in boreal biome;nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish richness was consistent across scales - same directionality and statistical significance across sampling stations, reservoirs and biomes;nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish richness was sensitive to the duration of the study, highlighting the need for a clear understanding of transient situations before reaching steady states in LCA.nC_LI

TI  - Predicting intervention priorities for wildlife conflicts.
PY  - 2019
AB  - There is growing interest in developing effective interventions to manage socially and environmentally damaging conservation conflicts. There are a variety of intervention strategies that can be applied in various contexts, but the reasons one type of intervention is chosen over another remain underexplored. We surveyed conservation researchers and practitioners (n = 427) to explore how characteristics of conflicts and characteristics of decision makers influence recommendations to alleviate conservation conflict. Using a full-factorial design, we experimentally manipulated 3 aspects of the descriptions of 8 different wildlife-conflict scenarios (development status of the conflict country, conflict framing, and legality of killing wild animals) and recorded which of 5 intervention types (wildlife impact reduction, awareness, enforcement, economic incentives, or stakeholder engagement) respondents prioritized. We also recorded information on respondents' demographic and disciplinary backgrounds. Stakeholder-based interventions were recommended most often in the survey and in written feedback. However, when we fitted multinomial mixed logit models with fully completed scenario responses (n = 411), recommendations were influenced by small changes in the details of conflict and differed according to respondent characteristics. Enforcement and awareness interventions were prioritized relatively more for conflicts in more highly developed nations and by respondents with more natural science backgrounds and relatively less experience with conflict. Contrastingly, economic interventions were prioritized more when wildlife killing was described as illegal. Age, gender, and development status of the respondent's home country also predicted some intervention decisions. Further, interrogating the influences shaping conservation decision making will further helps in the development of evidence-informed interventions.

TI  - Historical Ecology of Scandinavian Infield Systems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Infield systems originated during the early Iron Age and existed until the 19th century, although passing many transitions and changes. The core features of infield systems were enclosed infields with hay-meadows and crop fields, and unenclosed outland mainly used for livestock grazing. We examine the transitions and changes of domesticated landscapes with infield systems using the framework of human niche construction, focusing on reciprocal causation affecting change in both culture and environment. A first major transition occurred during the early Middle Ages, as a combined effect of a growing elite society and an increased availability of iron promoted expansion of villages with partly communal infields. A second major transition occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, due to a then recognized inefficiency of agricultural production, leading to land reforms. In outlands, there was a continuous expansion of management throughout the whole period. Even though external factors had significant impacts as well, human niche construction affected a range of cultural and environmental features regarding the management and structure of domesticated landscapes with infield systems. Thus, niche construction theory is a useful framework for understanding the historical ecology of infield systems.

TI  - Predatory behaviour of wolves in Scandinavia
PY  - 2014
AB  - The study of predatory behaviour is essential for understanding the interactions that may affect the behaviour and population dynamics of the species involved and consequent cascading ecosystem effects. In the case of large carnivores feeding on large ungulate prey, predation is strongly impacted by humans who alter the habitat of both predators and their prey, control population sizes, and compete with large carnivores for the same prey species. The objectives of this thesis were to 1) establish a robust method to estimate kill rates of wolves (Canis lupus); 2) estimate kill rates during both summer and winter; 3) relate kill rates to prey availability in winter (functional response) and to the energetic requirements of the wolf packs; and 4) to study the impact of roads on predatory and other behaviour of wolves. To meet these objectives, the Scandinavian Wolf Research Project (SKANDULV) fitted wolves with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and searched for kill remains on clusters of GPS-positions during defined time periods in winter and summer. Winter prey densities of cervids were assessed by spring counts of faecal pellet groups. High variation in the spatio-temporal movement pattern of wolves in relation to kill sites made it difficult to predictably identify kill sites along the wolf trajectory without fieldwork. Consequently, field personnel checked all clusters, and in addition some single positions, to obtain robust estimates of kill rate. Human disturbance at kill sites may be one possible reason for the high variation in the handling of kills, with a relatively short handling time associated with kills located in areas with a high potential for human disturbance. During summer, wolves preferred to be at intermediate distances to roads while handling prey. This was probably the result of a trade-off between avoidance of human presence and the preference for roads while traveling. In most wolf territories, moose (Alces alces) was the pre-dominant prey species during both summer and winter. Kill rates, measured as the acquired edible biomass per pack, did not differ between summer (mean ± SE = 24.0 ± 3.0 kg/day/pack) and winter (28.2 ± 2.3 kg/day/pack), but wolves killed twice as many moose per unit time in summer (0.60 ± 0.05 moose/day/pack) as during winter (0.31 ± 0.04 moose/day/pack). This difference occurred because wolves selected for moose calves and in summer these provided significantly less biomass per moose kill than in winter. In both seasons, per capita kill rates were negatively associated with wolf pack size. This negative association, combined with a positive association between kill rate and prey availability, resulted in a predator-dependent functional response in winter. Small wolf packs (2 – 4 wolves) acquired more than three times as much biomass as required to cover the energetic needs of the pack, while large packs (7 – 9 wolves) in territories with low to intermediate prey abundance seemed to be food-limited during winter. The average annual kill rate was estimated at 120 moose per wolf pack (95% CI 100 – 144) in territories where moose accounted for the majority of the kills. Predation rates during winter, i.e. the proportion of the moose population killed by predators, were not related to wolf pack size or kill rates, but were negatively correlated with the abundance of moose or the moose-to-wolf ratio within the wolf territory. Wolves did not regulate, but rather limited, the highly managed moose population in Scandinavia, with wolf-induced mortality being mainly additive to other sources of mortality. If the wolf population is to be controlled as a measure to reduce predation on moose, the removal of non-breeding pairs and small family groups will likely have a stronger effect on moose kill rates than a reduction in the number of wolves in larger packs.

TI  - Coexisting with Wolves in Cultural Landscapes: Fences as Communicative Devices
PY  - 2021
AB  - This paper argues that many conflicts regarding the return of the wolf to the thoroughly humanized and densely populated cultural landscapes of Western Europe rest on the dualistic idea that culture and nature are two strictly separated realms of reality, and on the assumption that wild animals are primarily passive beings without proper agency. Once we acknowledge wolves as beings with agency with whom we share the landscape, we come to see that the challenge of coexistence with wild animals such as wolves is not primarily a matter of finding a compromise between human interests and the interests of wild animals. Rather, we have to learn and negotiate that the landscape is a space that is interpreted and inhabited by many different beings, with whom we are always already communicating, even if we are not always aware of it.

TI  - Different Approaches Towards the Understanding of Socio-Environmental Conflicts in Protected Areas
PY  - 2018
AB  - Conflicts are an inherent element in the establishment and management of protected areas. Even though there is ample literature about conflicts in protected areas and the field of conservation has investigated them for decades, no consensus exists about the object itself of analysis: the conflict. In this article, we describe three different approaches for understanding socio-environmental conflicts, and we illustrate them with cases from protected areas in Mexico. The principal objective of the article is to advance discussions about the importance of understanding the implications of the use of different approaches on socio-environmental conflicts, in the interest of providing elements to take better decisions about the management of the protected areas.

TI  - The changing environment of conservation conflict : geese and farming in Scotland
PY  - 2017
AB  - Conflict between conservation objectives and human livelihoods is ubiquitous and can be highly damaging, but the processes generating it are poorly understood. Ecological elements are central to conservation conflict, and changes in their dynamics — for instance due to anthropogenic environmental change — are likely to influence the emergence of serious human–wildlife impacts and, consequently, social conflict. We used mixed-effects models to examine the drivers of historic spatio-temporal dynamics in numbers of Greenland barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) on the Scottish island of Islay to identify the ecological processes that have shaped the environment in which conflict between goose conservation and agriculture has been triggered. Barnacle goose numbers on Islay increased from 20,000 to 43,000 between 1987 and 2016. Over the same period, the area of improved grassland increased, the number of sheep decreased and the climate warmed. Goose population growth was strongly linked to the increasing area of improved grassland, which provided geese with more high quality forage. Changing climatic conditions, particularly warming temperatures on Islay and breeding grounds in Greenland, have also boosted goose numbers. As the goose population has grown, farms have supported geese more frequently and in larger numbers, with subsequent damaging effects on grassland. The creation of high-quality grassland appears to have largely driven the problem of serious economic damage by geese. Our analysis also reveals the drivers of spatial variation in goose impacts: geese were more likely to occur on farms closer to roosts and those with more improved grassland. However, as geese numbers have increased they have spread to previously less favoured farms. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the primary role of habitat modification in the emergence of conflict between goose conservation and agriculture, alongside a secondary role of climate change. Our research illustrates the value of exploring socio-ecological history to understand the processes leading to conservation conflict. In doing so, we identify those elements that are more controllable, such as local habitat management, and less controllable, such as climate change, but which both need to be taken into account when managing conservation conflict.

TI  - Land Use Changes (Recorded in Old Maps) and Delimitation of the Most Stable Areas from the Perspective of Land Use in the Kašperské Hory Region
PY  - 2009
AB  - The paper deals with the development of cultural landscape in the area of study in the Kasperske Hory region, Czech Republic, from the 1730s to the present and documents changes in spatial structure of land use in this period. The aim of the paper is to briefly characterize main phases in land use development and identify land use changes and their trajectories. The research tries not only to identify spatial changes of land use but also to compare these changes with natural conditions and socio-economic factors. The results show a clear tendency in natural succession, typical for marginal landscapes in the whole Europe, and to some extent homogenisation of the landscape in the second half of the 20th century. The major trajectories of change concern changes between arable land and permanent grassland. About 20% of the area remains stable from the perspective of land use which is different in comparison to other similar areas in the Czech Republic. Main socio-economic driving factors that influence land use development are population dynamics, changes in agricultural practises and management policies, whereas natural conditions do not play such a significant role.

TI  - Users or producers of ecosystem services? A scenario exercise for integrating conservation and reindeer herding in northeast Finland
PY  - 2012
AB  - Nature conservation is often seen as incompatible with pastoralism: conserved predators can cause significant harm to livestock, or livestock may conquer space from natural species. Currently, nature conservation and related policies are increasingly framed through the notion of ecosystem services, which form basis for human well-being. What are the implications of this framing in the relationships between pastoralism and conservation? To answer this question, we draw from our previous research to build four scenarios on the relationships between reindeer herding and nature conservation in northeast Finland. In the two ecosystem service, ‘user’ scenarios reindeer herders are seen to degrade nature, and thus should be controlled. In the first scenarios, reindeer herding is still compensated for its losses to predation, but in the second scenario, ‘reindeer farming’ and free grazing practises are eroded for achieving conservation objectives. If herding is viewed as a producer of ecosystem services, the herders' incentivised function would be to sustain predator populations and resemble natural species (wild forest reindeer). In our two ‘producer’ scenarios, new professions as ecosystem stewards or as ecotourism entrepreneurs emerge and herding changes from meat production priority to supporting the production of other ecosystem services. Novel solutions to conservation-pastoralism dilemmas might emerge if pastoral communities are seen as potential producers of ecosystem services. However, ‘producer-based’ conservation practises also include various uncertainties and might have negative impacts on pastoral communities' well-being, especially on the continuity of social and cultural traditions.

TI  - Effects of Bark Stripping on Timber Production and Structure of Norway Spruce Forests in Relation to Climatic Factors
PY  - 2019
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effects of bark stripping caused by sika deer (Cervus nippon [Temminck]) on the production and structure of young Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) forest stands (41–43 years). Production parameters, structure, diversity, and the dynamics of radial growth in selected forest stands in relation to climatic conditions were evaluated. Similar to other production parameters, stand volumes showed lower values on research plots heavily damaged by bark stripping (290 m3 ha−1) compared to stands with lower tree stem damages (441 m3 ha−1). A significant decrease in stem volume was recorded for trees with stem circumference damage higher than 1/3 of the stem circumference. In most cases, the trees were damaged between the ages of 10–23 years, specifically the radial growth was significantly lowered in this period. The diameter increment of damaged trees dropped to 64% of the healthy counterparts in this period. Bark stripping damages reached up to 93% of the stem circumference with a mean damage of 31%. Stem rot was found on 62% of damaged trees. In our study area, with respect to the terms of climatic conditions, precipitation had a higher effect on radial growth of the Norway spruce compared to temperature. The main limiting climatic factor of tree growth was the lack of precipitation within a growing season, particularly in June of the current year.

TI  - Are natural disturbances represented in strictly protected areas in Germany
PY  - 2021
AB  - Natural disturbances are largely suppressed in Central European landscapes due to economic and human safety concerns. European goals to increase the extent of secondary wilderness areas have the potential to support the restoration of threatened habitats associated with natural disturbances. Germany is among the Central European countries with the most advanced wilderness goals. This study aimed to investigate whether habitat types shaped by natural disturbances are mostly red-listed as threatened and require special consideration within systematic conservation planning (SCP). First, we reviewed literature and the German Red List of Threatened Habitat Types to identify the conservation status of habitat types associated with three natural abiotic disturbance types in Germany: floods, forest fires and landslides. Second, we mapped the potential area coverage of these disturbance types and identified gaps in the current network of strictly protected areas (PA) to inform SCP. Fifty-two per cent of the habitat types associated with the three disturbance types floods, forest fires and landslides were listed as & ldquo;critically endangered & rdquo; (n = 1) or & ldquo;endangered to critically endangered & rdquo; (n = 9). The potential area for river dynamics accounted for 4.3% of German terrestrial territory, areas potentially subject to forest fires accounted for 0.9% and areas with a very high susceptibility to landslides for 1.1%. Areas potentially subject to forest fires (0.15% strict PA coverage) and river dynamics (0.81%) were underrepresented in German National Parks and the core zones of Biosphere Reserve, whereas strict PA coverage of areas with a very high susceptibility to landslides was higher (6.8%). European and German wilderness goals can support the restoration of threatened habitat types associated with natural disturbances if spatial information on those areas is integrated into SCP concepts. Yet, sophisticated management regimes will be required to resolve conflicts between wilderness areas subject to natural disturbances and the surrounding cultural landscape and infrastructure.(c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Levels of conflict over wildlife: Understanding and addressing the right problem
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Human–wildlife conflicts are complex and defy simple explanations and solutions. The fields of conflict analysis and peacebuilding offer insights into the intensity, intractability, and possible approaches to addressing different kinds of conflict. Building on these fields, as well as advances in conservation practice, we adapt a framework for human–wildlife conflict that consists of three levels of conflict over wildlife: Level 1 conflicts are disputes over issues such as crop or livestock loss or concerns about safety, yet typically involve relatively high tolerance of the damage‐inducing species. In level 2 conflicts, in addition to visible impact of wildlife, there is a history of unsatisfactory attempts to address these issues, creating underlying resentment, tensions, and a sense of injustice among at least one of the parties. Level 3 conflicts are deep‐rooted and become intertwined with the identities of the parties and community involved, and extend to broader tensions over social identities and clashing values and beliefs. Such conflicts require mediated reconciliation dialogues and conflict transformation approaches. A structured understanding how to address a conflict before it escalates to a deeper level is fundamental for managing conservation challenges as complex and dynamic as conflicts over wildlife.</jats:p>

TI  - Road verges provide alternative habitats for some, but not all, meadow plants
PY  - 2021
AB  - Questions Agricultural intensification has led to the decline of biodiverse meadows and other semi-natural grasslands. Road verges offer potential alternative habitats for meadow species, but they may not be suitable for all meadow species due to different soil properties, frequent disturbances, pollution or suboptimal management. Are the communities of vascular plants and bryophytes similar or dissimilar to those in mown or grazed meadows? What kind of species are associated with road verges, mown meadows or grazed meadows? How do the habitat types differ in their soil conditions and disturbance intensity? Location The study was conducted on 36 sites in Central Finland. Methods We compared the vascular plant and bryophyte flora and the habitat characteristics of road verges, mown meadows and grazed meadows. Results The community composition of both vascular plants and bryophytes differed among the habitat types. Many species occurred in all three habitat types, but several meadow specialists were absent or less frequent in the road verges. In contrast, road verges hosted more forest species and ruderal species, especially bryophytes. Road verges differed from meadows in their soil conditions. Conclusions We conclude that although road verges may host some species typical to meadows, their value as alternative habitats could be increased by improved soil preparation and vegetation management. Meanwhile, the continued decline of quality habitats for meadow species underscores the need to maintain, increase and improve meadow management.

TI  - Semi-natural habitats in the European boreal region: Caught in the socio-ecological extinction vortex?
PY  - 2022
AB  - We propose to consider semi-natural habitats-hotspots for biodiversity-being caught in a socio-ecological extinction vortex, similar to the phenomenon described for species threatened with extinction. These habitats are essentially socioecological systems, in which socioeconomic drivers are interlinked with ecological processes. We identify four highly interlinked and mutually reinforcing socio-economic processes, pertaining to the importance of semi-natural habitats for (i) agricultural production, (ii) policy, research and development; (iii) vocational education in the fields of agricultural sciences and (iv) public's experiences with semi-natural habitats. Evidence from six countries in the boreal region demonstrates that recent slowing down or even reversal of two processes are insufficient to stop the extinction vortex phenomenon. We suggest research directions to ascertain the phenomenon, monitor its development and develop proactive actions to weaken the vortex. It is highly plausible that interventions directed at most, if not all, of the key vortex processes are needed to reverse the overall deteriorating trends of a socio-ecological system.

TI  - Whose Discourse Is It Anyway? Understanding Resistance through the Rise of "Barstool Biology" in Nature Conservation
PY  - 2015
AB  - This study examines what happens when contentious lay citizens harness the technical-ecological repertoire of experts as means of challenging nature conservation policy. The causes, manifestations, and implications of this phenomenon are elucidated through a critical discourse analysis. The case study is based on the wolf reintroduction project in Europe, with particular focus on Sweden, using illegal hunting discussions as a point of entry within the hunting community. It reveals the deployment of three topoi, which are defined as stock arguments situated within a discourse. Analysis shows how while some topoi often incur short-term gains in the debate because of their scientific guise, they are fundamentally relegated as folk science (or “barstool biology”) by government experts and, in some cases, contribute to the further marginalization of other knowledges. Acquiescence to this discourse is shown to greatly impede the debate. Finally, the study shows how lack of trust in the public dialog, which hunt...

TI  - Environmental factors affecting numbers of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus utilising an autumn stopover site
PY  - 2016
AB  - For huntable waterbird species, the autumn migration strategy may be important for their fitness, as their behaviour and environmental factors may influence their exposure to hunting mortality. Hunting activity may also reduce the access to food resources which may be limited in the wintering areas, thereby affecting winter survival. In this study we assessed the possible influence of food resources, weather conditions, inter-specific competition and hunting intensity (as a measure of possible disturbance) on abundance and distribution of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus at their main autumn stopover site in Norway. The results show that food resources in term of spilt cereal grain were abundant, even by the time the geese had moved on. Snow cover did not limit the food availability during the main migratory period. Inter-specific competition with greylag geese Anser anser reduced food supplies locally and appeared to be increasing. Goose hunting intensity varied among sites and our data indicate a negative relationship between hunting intensity and the rate at which geese consumed the food resources. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of pink-footed geese leave the stopover area earlier than they would otherwise, when hunting intensities are high. In the case of pink-footed geese, population consequences of disturbance is not a concern at present; however, an international species management plan calls for 1) keeping disturbance low in areas where geese do not cause conflicts with agriculture to prevent them being pushed to areas with problems, and 2) increased harvest to reduce and stabilise the population size. Both objectives can be met by reducing hunting disturbance in mid-Norway and it is recommended that a better local organisation of hunting is implemented.

PY  - 2019
AB  - We evaluated the skills of different palaeofire reconstruction techniques to reconstruct the fire history of a boreal landscape (Russian Karelia) affected by surface fires. The analysis of dated lacustrine sediments from two nearby lakes was compared with independent dendrochronological dating of fire scars, methods which have rarely been used in context of surface fires. We used two sediment sub-sampling volumes (1 and 3.5 cm3, wet volumes) and three methods of calculating the Charcoal Accumulation Rate to reconstruct fire histories: CHAR number, charcoal surface area and estimated charcoal volume. The results show that palaeofire reconstructions obtained with fossil charcoal data from lake sediments and dendrochronology are similar and complementary. Dendrochronological reconstruction of fire scars established 12 fire dates over the past 500 years, and paleo-data from lake sediments identified between 7 and 13 fire events. Several ‘false fire events’ were also recorded in the charcoal chronologies, likely because of errors associated with the estimation of the sediment accumulation rate in the unconsolidated part of the sediment. The number of replicates, that is, number of sub-samples and lakes analyzed, had an effect on the number of identified fire events, whereas no effect was seen in the variation in the analyzed sediment volume or the choice of the charcoal-based metric. Whenever possible, we suggest the use of the dendrochronological data as an independent control for the calibration of charcoal peak series, which helps provide more realistic millennia-long reconstruction of past fire activity. We also argue for the use of 1 cm3 sample volume, a sampling protocol involving sampling of more than one lake, and sufficient number of intra-sample replicates to achieve skilful reconstructions of past fire activity.

TI  - Climate drove the fire cycle and humans influenced fire occurrence in the East European boreal forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding long‐term forest fire histories of boreal landscapes is instrumental for parameterizing climate–fire interactions and the role of humans affecting natural fire regimes. The eastern sections of the European boreal zone currently lack a network of annually resolved and centuries‐long forest fire histories. To fill in this knowledge gap, we dendrochronologically reconstructed the 600‐year fire history of a middle boreal pine‐dominated landscape of the southern part of the Republic of Komi, Russia. We combined the reconstruction of fire cycle (FC) and fire occurrence with the data on the village establishment and climate proxies and discussed the relative contribution of climate versus human land use in shaping historic fire regimes. Over the 1340–1610 <jats:sc>ce</jats:sc> period, the territory had a FC of 66 years (with the 90% confidence envelope of 56.8 and 78.6 years). Fire activity increased during the 1620–1730 <jats:sc>ce</jats:sc> period, with the FC reaching 32 years (31.0–34.7 years). Between 1740–1950, the FC increased to 47 years (41.9–52.0). The most recent period, 1960–2010, marks FC's historic maximum, with the mean of 153 years (102.5–270.3). Establishment of the villages, often as small harbors on the Pechora River, was associated with a non‐significant increase in fire occurrence in the sites nearest the villages (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.07–0.20). We, however, observed a temporal association between village establishment and fire occurrence at the scale of the whole studied landscape. There was no positive association between the former and the FC. In fact, we documented a decline in the area burned, following the wave of village establishment during the second half of the 1600s and the first half of the 1700s. The lack of association between the dynamics of FC and the dates of village establishments, and the significant association between large fire years and the early and latewood pine chronologies, used as historic drought proxy, indirectly suggests that the climate was the primary control of the landscape‐level FCs in the studied forests. Pine‐dominated forests of the Komi Republic may hold a unique position as the ecosystem with the shortest history of human‐related shifts in fire cycles across the European boreal region.</jats:p>

TI  - Urban bird community assembly mechanisms and driving factors in university campuses in Nanjing, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Understanding the drivers of community assembly process is of great importance for better conservation outcomes; and the main mechanisms include competitive exclusion, environmental filtering and neutral assembly. While mechanisms of assembly processes for vertebrates living in natural habitats have been well studied, their urban counterparts encountering highly human modified environments are still largely understudied. As a result, there are knowledge gaps for urban planners to better protect urban biodiversity and develop eco-friendly cities. University campuses are important components of cities, harboring the majority of urban biodiversity. In this study, based on monthly bird surveys data covering 12 university campuses located either downtown or in the newly developed areas in Nanjing, China, in 2019, we studied the assembly processes of campus’s birds, and their main drivers, by modeling a set of ecological and landscape determinants. Our results showed that bird diversity in the newly developed areas were significantly higher than those downtown. The phylogeny of bird communities in all universities followed a pattern of aggregation, indicating that environmental filtering played a major role in the community assembly. Specifically, grass, water and building were the main factors affecting campus’s bird functional and phylogenetic diversity, with the area of grass and water habitats having a significant positive correlation with phylogenetic diversity while the building areas was negatively correlated. Our results emphasize that habitat features play a decisive role in determining urban bird community assembly processes. We suggest that increasing landscape diversity and improving the landscape connectivity could be a powerful way to maintain and promote urban bird diversity.</jats:p>

TI  - Understanding Fire Regimes for a Better Anthropocene
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p> Fire is an integral part of the Earth System and humans have skillfully used fire for millennia. Yet human activities are scaling up and reinforcing each other in ways that are reshaping fire patterns across the planet. We review these changes using the concept of the fire regime, which describes the timing, location, and type of fires. We then explore the consequences of fire regime changes on the biological, chemical, and physical processes that sustain life on Earth. Anthropogenic drivers such as climate change, land use, and invasive species are shifting fire regimes and creating environments unlike any humanity has previously experienced. Although human exposure to extreme wildfire events is increasing, we highlight how knowledge of fire regimes can be mobilized to achieve a wide range of goals, from reducing carbon emissions to promoting biodiversity and human well-being. A fire regime perspective is critical to navigating toward a sustainable future—a better Anthropocene. </jats:p>

TI  - Landscape metrics as indicators of avian community structures – A state of the art review
PY  - 2022
AB  - In this state-of-the-art review, we investigate the use of landscape metrics in landscape ecology studies to predict structure of avian communities. We reviewed papers published in international peer-reviewed journals indexed by Web of Science Core, from January 2010 to December 2021. We give an overview of the study methods used in the past twelve years, the type of landscapes investigated, and the most important landscape metrics that show a significant influence on the ecological parameters of bird community distribution. We demonstrate that study designs are highly variable and thus only comparable to a limited extent. We identify multiple factors of spatial data usage that are important in determining the characterisation of landscape pattern and affect the outcome of analysis in landscape ecology that need to be standardised to allow simplification and generalization of results. Few empirical studies exist which describe the indicator value of landscape metrics comprehensively, taking into account different spatial scales, thematic resolution, landscapes and species, and the need for conducting such surveys in order to be able to use landscape metrics as a biodiversity monitoring tool in a targeted way.

TI  - Time series analysis reveals synchrony and asynchrony between conflict management effort and increasing large grazing bird populations in northern Europe
PY  - 2018
AB  - The management of conflicts between wildlife conservation and agricultural practices often involves the implementation of strategies aimed at reducing the cost of wildlife impacts on crops. Vital to the success of these strategies is the perception that changes in management efforts are synchronized relative to changes in impact levels, yet this expectation is never evaluated. We assess the level of synchrony between time series of population counts and management effort in the context of conflicts between agriculture and five populations of large grazing birds in northern Europe. We reveal inconsistent patterns of synchrony and asynchrony between changes in population counts and impact management effort relating to population harvesting, monetary payments, or scaring practices. This variation is likely due to differing management aims, the existence of lags between management decisions and population monitoring, and the inconsistent use of predictive models across case studies. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more adaptive and timely responses of management to changes in target species numbers so as not to unexpectedly increase social conflicts and jeopardize the status of wildlife populations.

TI  - Enhanced Super-Resolution Mapping of Urban Floods Based on the Fusion of Support Vector Machine and General Regression Neural Network
PY  - 2019
AB  - Super-resolution mapping of urban flood (SMUF) is one of the hotspots in remote sensing and urban environment research. In this letter, a new SMUF method based on the fusion of support vector machine and general regression neural network (FSVMGRNN) was proposed to achieve enhanced performance. An SVM-SMUF algorithm was developed and a fusion criterion was formulated. Then, the FSVMGRNN-SMUF algorithm was developed. The results of FSVMGRNN-SMUF were evaluated using Landsat 8 OLI imagery of two representative cities in China. FSVMGRNN-SMUF yielded the most accurate SMUF results among the five SMUF methods according to visual comparisons and quantitative comparisons. The mapping accuracy of FSVMGRNN-SMUF related to the kernel functions was also analyzed and discussed. The results of this letter will help to boost practical applications of median-low resolution remote sensing images in urban flooding mapping, and to strengthen the means for monitoring and assessing urban flooding disasters.

TI  - Global change and ecosystem connectivity: How geese link fields of central Europe to eutrophication of Arctic freshwaters.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Migratory connectivity by birds may mutually affect different ecosystems over large distances. Populations of geese overwintering in southern areas while breeding in high-latitude ecosystems have increased strongly over the past decades. The increase is likely due to positive feedbacks caused by climate change at both wintering, stopover sites and breeding grounds, land-use practices at the overwintering grounds and protection from hunting. Here we show how increasing goose populations in temperate regions, and increased breeding success in the Arctic, entail a positive feedback with strong impacts on Arctic freshwater ecosystems in the form of eutrophication. This may again strongly affect community composition and productivity of the ponds, due to increased nutrient loadings or birds serving as vectors for new species.

TI  - Coproduction of Food, Cultural Heritage and Biodiversity by Livestock Grazing in Swedish Semi-natural Grasslands
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Livestock has been a backbone of people's livelihood as long as agriculture has existed in Scandinavia, c. 6,000 years. In the early Iron Age, c. 2,000 years ago, a land management system began to form, composed of infields (enclosed hay-meadows and crop fields) and outlying land used for livestock grazing. Despite many later innovations and societal changes affecting agricultural technology and practices, this way of organizing land use was a template for how landscapes were managed and structured until the modernization of agriculture and forestry during the last centuries. There are legacies of this historic land-use, mainly as “semi-natural grasslands” managed by livestock grazing (open or semi-open; long continuity of management; not much influenced by commercial fertilizers, plowing etc.). These semi-natural grasslands harbor an exceptional small-scale biodiversity, particularly plants and insects. Landscapes with semi-natural grasslands represent cultural heritage, and are appreciated for their beauty. The total area of semi-natural grasslands has declined considerably during the past 100 years, and the current trend suggest that further declines are expected. A large fraction of threatened biodiversity in Sweden thrives in these grasslands. Livestock grazing in semi-natural grasslands makes an important contribution to food production, and there is an increasing interest in consumption of products, mainly meat, from these grasslands. This implies that there is a positive feedback between food production, maintenance of biological diversity, and cultural heritage. This paper gives an overview of semi-natural grasslands, focusing on Sweden, from a historic, cultural and ecological perspective, and aims at discussing challenges and prospects for developing and maintaining positive associations between producing food, biodiversity, and cultural heritage, in the future.</jats:p>

TI  - Five Ways of Characterizing Agricultural Land Use Dynamics and Abandonment from Subsidy Data
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abandonment of agricultural land is a process described from different regions of many industrialized countries. Given the current focus on land use, land use change and food security, it appears highly relevant to develop improved tools to identify and monitor the dynamics of agricultural land abandonment. In particular, the temporal aspect of abandonment needs to be assessed and discussed. In this study, we used the detailed information available through the Norwegian subsidy claim database and analyzed the history of use of unique land parcels through a fourteen-year period. We developed and tested five different statistics identifying these land parcels, their temporal dynamics and the extent of occurrence. What became apparent was that a large number of land parcels existing in the database as agricultural land were taken out of production, but then entered into production again at a later stage. We believe that this approach to describe the temporal dynamics of land abandonment, including how it can be measured and mapped, may contribute to the understanding of the dynamics in land abandonment, and thus also contribute to an improved understanding of the food production system.

TI  - A review of historical reconstruction methods of land use/land cover
PY  - 2014
AB  - Understanding long-term human-environment interactions requires historical re- construction of past land-use and land-cover changes. Most reconstructions have been based primarily on consistently available and relatively standardized information from his- torical sources. Based on available data sources and a retrospective research, in this paper we review the approaches and methods of the digital reconstruction and analyze their ad- vantages and possible constraints in the following aspects: (1) Historical documents contain qualitative or semi-quantitative information about past land use, which also usually include land-cover data, but preparation of archival documents is very time-consuming. (2) Historical maps and pictures offer visual and spatial quantitative land-cover information. (3) Natural archive has significant advantages as a method for reconstructing past vegetation and has its unique possibilities especially when historical records are missing or lacking, but it has great limits of rebuilding certain land-cover types. (4) Historical reconstruction models have been gradually developed from empirical models to mechanistic ones. The method does not only reconstruct the quantity of land use/cover in historical periods, but it also reproduces the spatial distribution. Yet there are still few historical land-cover datasets with high spatial resolution. (5) Reconstruction method based on multiple-source data and multidisciplinary research could build historical land-cover from multiple perspectives, complement the missing data, verify reconstruction results and thus improve reconstruction accuracy. However, there are challenges that make the method still in the exploratory stage. This method can be a long-term development goal for the historical land-cover reconstruction. Researchers should focus on rebuilding historical land-cover dataset with high spatial resolution by developing new models so that the study results could be effectively applied in simulations of climatic and ecological effects.

TI  - Integration of ground survey and remote sensing derived data: Producing robust indicators of habitat extent and condition.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The availability of suitable habitat is a key predictor of the changing status of biodiversity. Quantifying habitat availability over large spatial scales is, however, challenging. Although remote sensing techniques have high spatial coverage, there is uncertainty associated with these estimates due to errors in classification. Alternatively, the extent of habitats can be estimated from ground-based field survey. Financial and logistical constraints mean that on-the-ground surveys have much lower coverage, but they can produce much higher quality estimates of habitat extent in the areas that are surveyed. Here, we demonstrate a new combined model which uses both types of data to produce unified national estimates of the extent of four key habitats across Great Britain based on Countryside Survey and Land Cover Map. This approach considers that the true proportion of habitat per km2 (Zi ) is unobserved, but both ground survey and remote sensing can be used to estimate Zi . The model allows the relationship between remote sensing data and Zi to be spatially biased while ground survey is assumed to be unbiased. Taking a statistical model-based approach to integrating field survey and remote sensing data allows for information on bias and precision to be captured and propagated such that estimates produced and parameters estimated are robust and interpretable. A simulation study shows that the combined model should perform best when error in the ground survey data is low. We use repeat surveys to parameterize the variance of ground survey data and demonstrate that error in this data source is small. The model produced revised national estimates of broadleaved woodland, arable land, bog, and fen, marsh and swamp extent across Britain in 2007.

TI  - A gradient analytic perspective on distribution modelling
PY  - 2012
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>After massive proliferation over the last decade, distribution modelling (DM) – research with the purpose of modelling the distribution of observable objects of a specific type – has grown into an independent branch of ecological science. There is consensus that this new discipline needs a stronger theoretical foundation. I describe DM as an inductive scientific process with 12 steps, organised into three composite steps: ecological model, data model, and statistical model. Step 8, modelling of the overall ecological response, places DM unambiguously among gradient analysis techniques and motivates for a gradient analytic (GA) perspective on DM. DM terminology is reviewed and revised accordingly.</jats:p> <jats:p> Three fundamental insights of the GA perspective are described: (1) that external ‘factors’ do not influence the species one by one, but act on the species in concert; (2) that a few major complex-gradients normally account for most of the variation in species composition that can be explained environmentally; and (3) that species occur within a restricted interval along each major complex-gradient. These insights are developed into a theoretical platform for DM. General patterns of species performance variation along environmental complex-gradients and the structuring processes responsible for these patterns are reviewed. Three categories of ecoclines, i.e., gradients of variation in species composition and the environment, are recognised: regional ecoclines, local ecoclines, and condition or impact ecoclines. Causes and implications of the unimodal shape of species’ responses to environmental complex-gradients are reviewed. Structuring processes are divided into three categories: limited physiological tolerance, interspecific interactions, and demographic processes. Relationships between categories of ecoclines, the processes responsible for variation in species performance along them, and the spatial and temporal scale intervals in which variation is large, are reviewed.</jats:p> <jats:p> The GA perspective forms the basis for discussions of important steps in the DM process. Initially, the controversial concepts of the habitat and the niche are reviewed and their role in the ecological model (Step 1) discussed. I conclude that neither of these concepts are necessary, nor useful, for DM. As an alternative to conceptual models based upon the niche concept, I propose a new conceptual modelling framework for DM, the HED framework, which is rooted in the gradient analytic perspective. I show how this new framework can be used, in initial phases of a DM study to formulate a meta-model for factors that influence distributions, and in the analytic phase to guide important choices of methods and options and to assist interpretation of modelling results. Important data model issues are: collection of data for the modelled target and preparation of raw response variables (Steps 2 and 6); collection of explanatory data (Step 3); conceptualisation of the study area (Step 4); collection of data for calibration and evaluation (Step 9); and transformation of explanatory variables to derived variables subjected to DM (Step 5,ii). Important statistical model issues are: statistical model formulation, i.e. choice of method (Step 7,i) and model specification (Step 7,ii); model selection and internal assessment of model performance (Steps 8,i and 8,ii); and model evaluation (Step 10). Two points are emphasised: (1) that modelling purpose should inform choice of methods and options; and (2) the importance of an independently collected presence/absence data set, which can be used to calibrate, evaluate and iteratively improve models.</jats:p> <jats:p> Finally I list seven challenges of particular importance for progress in DM: (1) that more knowledge of patterns of natural variation is needed; (2) that a better mechanistic understanding of causes of patterns of natural variation is needed; (3) that the availability of relevant rasterised explanatory variables needs to be improved; (4) that more studies of patterns at local and micro spatial scales, in addition to multiple-scale studies using DM methods, are needed; (5) that evaluation by independent data should be established as a standard in DM; (6) that further insights into statistical modelling methods and their options, with particular reference to appropriateness for different types of data and DM purposes, are needed; and (7) that DM methods should be incorporated in studies with a broader scope. I conclude that there are considerable potentials for improvement of DM methods and practice. Increased return from DM in terms of contributions that improve our understanding of patterns of natural variation and their causes, should be expected.</jats:p>

TI  - Bumble bee communities in power‐line clearings: Effects of experimental management practices
PY  - 2020
AB  - Bumble bees fill an important function in temperate, boreal and alpine ecosystems as pollinators of wild plants and cultivated crops. Global declines in population size of many bumble bee species call for knowledge about how habitats influenced by human land use can be managed to accommodate diverse bumble bee communities. We carried out a field experiment to study effects on bumble bee communities in power‐line clearings in response to different vegetation clearing practices: (i) cutting, (ii) cutting and removing, and (iii) not cutting the woody vegetation, whilst simultaneously assessing the effect of environmental variables, both individually and in interaction with treatment. Cutting the woody vegetation improved habitat quality for bumble bees relative to the uncut treatment, whereas removal of woody debris provided no additional benefit. The treatment effect on bee richness, diversity, abundance, and the abundance of generalist bees depended on local forb species richness. Increasing functional variation of forbs and cover of forbs with nectar tubes were positively related to species richness and abundance of bees, irrespective of treatment. The abundance of specialized long‐tongued and late emerging bumble bees – which are of special conservation interest – were higher in the cut and cut‐remove treatments and increased with functional variation of forb species irrespective of treatments. Management to improve habitat conditions for bumble bees in power‐line clearings does not require costly removal of woody debris after cutting, but more frequent cutting can benefit specialized bumble bee species of particular conservation interest.

TI  - Understanding conservation conflicts associated with rodent outbreaks in farmland areas.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rodent outbreaks affect many farmland areas worldwide and the negative environmental impacts of control campaigns cause intense social tensions. In such conservation conflicts, understanding stakeholders’ viewpoints is critical to promote ecologically sustainable management. We used Q-methodology, a framework standing between qualitative and quantitative social research, to investigate human subjectivity and understand conflicts caused by rodent outbreaks in Spain. We interviewed farmers, conservationists, hunters, and governmental agencies, and identified five main discourses about the origins and consequences of the conflictive situation. Finding sustainable management is impaired by opposing views about causes and consequences of vole outbreaks and their management, which are at the root of the conflict. Social tensions will likely remain until the underlying conflicts between people holding different views are also managed. Decision-making should therefore focus on mitigating underlying conflicts. Using trained independent mediators would help the effective resolution of conservation conflicts caused by rodent outbreaks and their management.

TI  - Coexistence of large mammals and humans is possible in Europe's anthropogenic landscapes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Summary A critical question in the conservation of large mammals in the Anthropocene is to know the extent to which they can tolerate human disturbance. Surprisingly, little quantitative data is available about large-scale effects of human activity and land use on their broad scale distribution in Europe. In this study, we quantify the relative importance of human land use and protected areas as opposed to biophysical constraints on large mammal distribution. We analyze data on large mammal distribution to quantify the relative effect of anthropogenic variables on species' distribution as opposed to biophysical constraints. We finally assess the effect of anthropogenic variables on the size of the species' niche by simulating a scenario where we assumed no anthropogenic pressure on the landscape. Results show that large mammal distribution is primarily constrained by biophysical constraints rather than anthropogenic variables. This finding offers grounds for cautious optimism concerning wildlife conservation in the Anthropocene.

TI  - What wild dogs want: Habitat selection differs across life stages and orders of selection in a wide-ranging carnivore
PY  - 2020
AB  - Habitat loss is a key threat to the survival of many species. Habitat selection studies provide key information for conservation initiatives by identifying important habitat and anthropogenic characteristics influencing the distribution of threatened species in changing landscapes. However, assumptions about the homogeneity of individual choices on habitat, regardless of life stage, are likely to result in inaccurate assessment of conservation priorities. This study addresses a knowledge gap in how animals at different life stages diverge in how they select habitat and anthropogenic features, using a free-ranging population of African wild dogs living in a human-dominated landscape in Kenya as a case study. Using GPS collar data to develop resource selection function and step selection function models, this study investigated differences between second order (selection of home range across a landscape) and third order (selection of habitat within the home range) habitat selection across four life history stages when resource requirements may vary: resident-non-denning, resident-heavily-pregnant, resident-denning and dispersing. Wild dogs showed strong second order selection for areas with low human population densities and areas close to rivers and roads. More rugged areas were also generally selected, as were areas with lower percentage tree cover. The strength of selection for habitat variables varied significantly between life stages; for example, dispersal groups were more tolerant of higher human population densities, whereas denning and pregnant packs were least tolerant of such areas. Habitat selection patterns varied between individuals at different life stages and at different orders of selection. These analyses showed that denning packs and dispersal groups, the two pivotal life stages which drive wild dog population dynamics, exhibited different habitat selection to resident-non-breeding packs. Dispersal groups were relatively tolerant of higher human population densities whereas denning packs preferred rugged, remote areas. Evaluating different orders of selection was important as the above trends may not be detectable at all levels of selection for all habitat characteristics. Our analyses demonstrate that when life stage information is included in analyses across different orders of selection, it improves our understanding of how animals use their landscapes, thus providing important insights to aid conservation planning.

TI  - The role of seasonality in assessments of conflict tendency between tourism development and ecological preservation in protected areas: The case of protected areas in China.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conflict management in PAs (Protected Areas) is becoming increasingly important in the context of the rapid development of nature-based tourism. Literature proposes the Index of Conflict tendency between Tourism development and ecological Protection (ICTP) to analyze the tendency of conflict from a spatial perspective, but this index does not consider the factor of seasonality which is important in tourism. The current study considers seasonality and proposes the CVD (Coverage- Variation- Duration) framework to conduct a spatio-temporal analysis of the ICTP. The applied research based on the case of China's V-PAs (a specific category of PAs) reflects that the CVD framework can describe the spatial distribution of the ICTP from a seasonal perspective. The study finds that, among V-PAs in China, 42.16% of the areas with high ICTP of V-PAs have obvious seasonal variations, which shows that PAs conflict management must incorporate the factor of seasonality. The study also shows that 8.98% of V-PAs have large-scale coverage of areas with high ICTP, revealing priorities for conflict management. 3.96% of V-PAs have large-scale coverage of areas with high ICTP showing seasonal changes. Management in these areas should pay attention to seasonal changes to become more effective. The CVD framework proposed in this paper is operable and extendable and can provide analytical tools for PAs conflict management, and promote ecological protection and more sustainable tourism development in PAs.

TI  - Wave of fire: an anthropogenic signal in historical fire regimes across central Pennsylvania, USA
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Increasingly detailed records of long‐term fire regime characteristics are needed to test ecological concepts and inform natural resource management and policymaking. We reconstructed and analyzed twelve 350+ yr‐long fire scar records developed from 2612 tree‐ring dated fire scars on 432 living and dead pine (<jats:italic>Pinus pungens</jats:italic>,<jats:italic> Pinus rigida</jats:italic>,<jats:italic> Pinus resinosa</jats:italic>,<jats:italic> Pinus echinata</jats:italic>) trees from across central Pennsylvania. We used multiple spatial and time series analysis methods to quantify fire regime characteristics (frequency, seasonality, percentages of trees scarred, extent) and fire–climate–human associations. Prior to the 20th‐century fire suppression, fire regimes at the majority of sites consisted of frequent, low‐to‐moderate severity, dormant season fires. Fires were often regionally synchronous when preceded by significantly dry years. Using documentary archives, we provide the first description of a “wave of fire”—an anthropogenic signal in fire frequency that progressively moved across the region. This “wave of fire” reflects a changing progression of anthropogenic fire regimes from Native American occupation and depopulation, to Euro‐American settlement, to industrialization and declining fire use up to the 20th century era of fire suppression. The wave of fire provides a new perspective on historical and modern fire regime dynamics and identifies socio‐ecological impacts since North American colonization. Because the anthropogenic wave of fire exists at sites across North America, we emphasize the need for a broader determination of its geographic prevalence and variability as such determinations could influence historical ecology interpretations and perspectives on past and future roles of humans in managing ecosystems with fire.</jats:p>

TI  - Yield reductions in agricultural grasslands in Norway after springtime grazing by pink-footed geese
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary A large population increase of the Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus over recent decades has intensified the conflict with agriculture at the spring-staging sites in Norway. Knowledge of the yield loss caused by goose grazing in these northern areas is lacking, and the motivation behind the study was to quantify a relationship between grazing pressure and yield loss of agricultural grasslands and corresponding changes in vegetation composition. Field trials were established on agricultural grasslands at four sites in central Norway. Eight plots were established at each site; four with exclosures to exclude or reduce grazing from geese and four with access for the geese. The exact same plots were followed for 2–4 years. Dropping density, used as a measure of grazing pressure, and compressed sward height were recorded throughout the goose staging periods, and dry matter yield was determined at first and second harvests. Plant samples from first harvests were analysed for vegetation composition. Grazing pressure varied between both years and sites. Exclosures reduced grazing pressure by 75–78% during high-pressure grazing periods and increased first harvest yields by up to 31%. At lower grazing pressure, exclosures prevented grazing completely. Grazing pressure was inversely correlated with dry matter yield at first harvest, but second harvest yields were unaffected. The fraction of sown species declined while the fraction of weeds increased during the study both in open plots and exclosures, but level of grazing pressure did not have any significant influence on the overall fraction of sown species, or in any specific year. Synthesis and applications. As the same plots were measured over several years, it was possible to quantify goose-grazing effects beyond one season. In the context of the wildlife-agriculture conflict, the results demonstrate that some farmers always suffer disproportionately with yearly variations. The relationship between grazing pressure and yield loss may provide knowledge to a regional goose grazing subsidy scheme in the study area, identifying the most affected areas and distributing the subsidies correspondingly. However, the seasonal variations in grazing pressure demonstrate the difficulty of targeting exact areas on a yearly basis. On the other hand, the observed variations may promote another management tool in the form of delayed ploughing of stubble fields before spring sowing, as stubble fields may attract more geese, reducing the grazing pressure on agricultural grasslands and hence the overall conflicts with agricultural interests.

TI  - Learn to Extract Building Outline from Misaligned Annotation through Nearest Feature Selector
PY  - 2020
AB  - For efficient building outline extraction, many algorithms, including unsupervised or supervised, have been proposed over the past decades. In recent years, due to the rapid development of the convolutional neural networks, especially fully convolutional networks, building extraction is treated as a semantic segmentation task that deals with the extremely biased positive pixels. The state-of-the-art methods, either through direct or indirect approaches, are mainly focused on better network design. The shifts and rotations, which are coarsely presented in manually created annotations, have long been ignored. Due to the limited number of positive samples, the misalignment will significantly reduce the correctness of pixel-to-pixel loss that might lead to a gradient explosion. To overcome this, we propose a nearest feature selector (NFS) to dynamically re-align the prediction and slightly misaligned annotations. The NFS can be seamlessly appended to existing loss functions and prevent misleading by the errors or misalignment of annotations. Experiments on a large scale aerial image dataset with centered buildings and corresponding building outlines indicate that the additional NFS brings higher performance when compared to existing naive loss functions. In the classic L1 loss, the addition of NFS gains increments of 8.8% of f1-score, 8.9% of kappa coefficient, and 9.8% of Jaccard index, respectively.

TI  - Josephian cadastre as a source of geographic information on historical landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:p>The article deals with the potential of the Josephian Cadastre (1785–1790) to be the first modern cadastre in the territory of the Habsburg Monarchy for the purposes of the geographic research of historical landscapes. Although the cadastre is not equipped with maps, the Book of Fasí provides very detailed written information of each plot within the defined cadastral area. The case study focuses on the applicability of the Josephian Cadastre on the research of historical land use and the possibility of involving it as another time horizon in the LUCC Czechia database (1846–2010). We carried out a check of the borders defined in the Josephian Cadastre with the later Stabile Cadaster (1837–1843) and its maps using the retrogression method. It was ascertained that the cadastral areas did not correspond to each other and their homogenization was necessary for further comparison. Despite the fact that some areas were not surveyed in the Josephian Cadastre, this source can be used to acquire detailed data of land use in eight basic classes and to utilize them both in the research of landscape macrostructure – and for specific landscape elements, such as ponds, balks, hedgerows, rocks, and remnants of montane activities.</jats:p>

TI  - Identifying conflicts tendency between nature-based tourism development and ecological protection in China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Developing spatial regulation strategies is important for nature-based tourism, and this procedure could be more rational and scientific with the understanding of the spatial distribution of conflicts tendency between tourism development and ecological protection. In this study, we developed an Indicator of Conflict tendency between nature-based Tourism development and ecological Protection (ICTP), based on the combination of landscape attractiveness and ecological sensitivity. By integrating land cover, topography, climate and other datasets, this paper presents the spatial distribution of the ICTP in the study area in China. The results show that most areas of China have a low or medium ICTP. Areas with very high ICTP account for 13.79% of the studied areas, including the central part of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, northern part of the Loess Plateau, southwestern part of the Northeast Plain, north and south sides of Tianshan Mountains, coast of Bohai Bay and coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province. These areas are mainly confronted with problems of desertification, salinization and soil erosion. 11.09% of studied areas have very low ICTP, mainly located in the Tarim Basin and western part of Inner Mongolia Plateau, characterized by low landscape attractiveness and low ecological sensitivity. Our results can inform decision makers with regard to where are most likely to suffer from ecological problems caused by nature-based tourism activities, and to which types of problems that are likely to arise. Such information can help decision makers forecast the developmental trend of the relationship between nature-based tourism development and ecological protection, further determine the degree of control on nature-based tourism. The study developed the basic framework for measuring the conflict tendency of nature-based tourism development and ecological protection, which can inspire researchers to think about factors that should be considered when measuring such tendency.

TI  - Fragment connectivity shapes bird communities through functional trait filtering in two types of grasslands
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Habitat fragmentation is considered one of the most severe threatening factors for global biodiversity. Here we assessed, how local and landscape scale environmental variables, such as fragment size (small vs. large) and landscape configuration (measured as connectivity index) relates to bird community composition, species richness, abundance and functional diversity. We surveyed 60 grassland fragments in Hungary, belonging to two different threatened grassland types, namely forest-steppes and kurgans. Forest-steppes are natural mosaics of grasslands and forests at the contact zone between closed-canopy temperate forests and steppe grasslands. Kurgans are ancient burial mounds, found on the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe zone. These fragments were embedded in plantation forestry, respectively, agricultural matrix with gradients of size and connectivity. Both habitats are threatened by forestry and agricultural intensification, though these fragments may serve as important wildlife refuges. Our findings revealed that forest-steppe birds were more diverse and abundant in large and well-connected than in small isolated fragments. High connectivity affected ground nesting birds in small forest-steppe fragments positively. Birds inhabiting kurgan area showed higher trait similarity in well-connected than in isolated fragments. Bird abundance of kurgans associated with small home range size and ground feeding habit were higher in connected compared to isolated fragments. Highly isolated kurgans filtered for more specialised bird species but not for generalists. We provide conservation implications for enhancing grassland specialist bird communities, which consist of preservation of large, well-connected grassland fragments within production landscapes and through reconsideration of the currently used intensive forestry.

TI  - Progress in grassland cover conservation in Southern European Mountains by 2020: a transboundary assessment in the Iberian Peninsula with satellite observations (2002–2019)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conservation and policy agendas, such as the European Biodiversity strategy, Aichi biodiversity (target 5) and Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), are overlooking the progress made in mountain grassland cover conservation by 2020, which has significant socio-ecological implications to Europe. However, because the existing data near 2020 is scarce, the shifting character of mountain grasslands remains poorly characterized, and even less is known about the conservation outcomes because of different governance regimes and map uncertainty. Our study used Landsat satellite imagery over a transboundary mountain region in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Peneda-Geres) to shed light on these aspects. Supervised classifications with a multiple classifier ensemble approach (MCE) were performed, with post classification comparison of maps established and bias-corrected to identify the trajectory in grassland cover, including protected and unprotected governance regimes. By analysing class-allocation (Shannon entropy), creating 95% confidence intervals for the area estimates, and evaluating the class-allocation thematic accuracy relationship, we characterized uncertainty in the findings. The bias-corrected estimates suggest that the positive progress claimed internationally by 2020 was not achieved. Our null hypothesis to declare a positive progress (at least equality in the proportion of grassland cover of 2019 and 2002) was rejected (X2 = 1972.1, df = 1, p < 0.001). The majority of grassland cover remained stable (67.1 ± 10.1 relative to 2002), but loss (−32.8 ± 7.1% relative to 2002 grasslands cover) overcame gain areas (+11.4 ± 6.6%), indicating net loss as the prevailing pattern over the transboundary study area (−21.4%). This feature prevailed at all extents of analysis (lowlands, −22.9%; mountains, −17.9%; mountains protected, −14.4%; mountains unprotected, −19.7%). The results also evidenced that mountain protected governance regimes experienced a lower decline in grassland extent compared to unprotected. Shannon entropy values were also significantly lower in correctly classified validation sites (z = −5.69, p = 0.0001, n = 708) suggesting a relationship between the quality of pixel assignment and thematic accuracy. We therefore encourage a post-2020 conservation and policy action to safeguard mountain grasslands by enhancing the role of protected governance regimes. To reduce uncertainty, grassland gain mapping requires additional remote sensing research to find the most adequate spatial and temporal data resolution to retrieve this process.

TI  - "They Need to Be Managed:" Hunters' and Ranchers' Narratives of Increased Tolerance of Wolves after a Decade of Wolf Hunting
PY  - 2022
AB  - How do hunters and livestock producers who report increased tolerance for wolves account for the changes in their attitudes, and how can their perspectives inform researchers’ understanding of human conflicts about wolves? I explore this by analyzing interviews with people who live, work, and recreate in the Blackfoot watershed, Montana. All interviewees who reported increased tolerance over time were hunters and ranchers with good relationships with government wildlife officials and close ties to a collaborative nonprofit, Blackfoot Challenge. All who reported increased tolerance attributed their tolerance to the legalization of wolf hunting (sometimes in addition to other factors). Several expressed anger at environmental and animal rights groups who used lawsuits to keep hunting illegal for longer in the state. My data suggests that intolerance for wolves may stem from an injustice frame, a belief that humans bear some blame for causing harm.

TI  - Habitat metrics based on multi-temporal Landsat imagery for mapping large mammal habitat
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Up‐to‐date and fine‐scale habitat information is essential for managing and conserving wildlife. Studies assessing wildlife habitat commonly rely on categorical land‐cover maps as predictors in habitat models. However, broad land‐cover categories often do not adequately capture key habitat features and generating robust land‐cover maps is challenging and laborious. Continuous variables derived directly from satellite imagery provide an alternative for capturing land‐cover characteristics in habitat models. Improved data availability and processing capacities now allow integrating all available images from medium‐resolution sensors in compositing approaches that derive spectral‐temporal metrics at the pixel level, summarizing spectral responses over time. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of such metrics derived from Landsat imagery for mapping wildlife habitat. We categorize spectral‐temporal metrics into <jats:italic>habitat metrics</jats:italic> characterizing different aspects of wildlife habitat. Comparing the performance of these metrics against categorical land‐cover maps in habitat models for lynx, red deer and roe deer, we found that models using habitat metrics consistently outperformed models based on categorical land‐cover maps, with average improvements of 13.7% in model AUC and 9.7% in the Continuous Boyce Index. Performance increases were larger for seasonal habitat models, indicating that the habitat metrics capture intra‐annual variability in habitat conditions better than land‐cover maps. Comparing suitability maps to ancillary data further revealed that our habitat metrics were sensitive to fine‐scale heterogeneity in habitat associated with forest structure. Overall, our study highlights the considerable potential of Landsat‐based spectral temporal metrics for assessing wildlife habitat. Given these metrics can be derived directly and in an automatized fashion from globally and freely available Landsat imagery, they open up new possibilities for monitoring habitat dynamics in space and time.</jats:p>

TI  - Road Verges: Potential Refuges for Declining Grassland Species Despite Remnant Vegetation Dynamics
PY  - 2011
AB  - Whether road verge vegetation can be manipulated to resemble traditionally managed grassland has been much debated. This short-term study compared management effects on road verge and pasture vegetation in western Norway. We quantified vegetation change and explored whether it occurred along underlying environmental gradients. We found management-related variation in species richness and vegetation physiognomy, but high resistance in species composition prevented directional changes in vegetation dynamics. Initial differences between the habitats indicated historical management effects on traditionally managed pastures and road verges. Given proper management, road verges may have a nature conservation potential. Moreover, their linear structure may enable fine-scale mosaic management that allows the coexistence of a wide range of grassland species.

TI  - Untangling Invasive Narratives: Boundaries, Belonging, and Narrative Agency
PY  - 2023
AB  - This article explores the ways that stories about boundaries and belonging are bound up with cultural narrative frames that set the stage for the interpretation of new, or often recreated, accounts. I use the term “invasive narrative,” to refer to the force with which these narratives can invade and shape interpretations of unfolding situations. These disputes are entangled with broader narratives that provoke ambivalence toward open borders, migration, as well as cultural and biological fluidity. Narratives can be “invasive” in another sense when they dwell on the apparent unnatural, intrusive, and unwelcome elements of a species’ presence – a label that can also be used to target native species that have reemerged after a long absence. To explore these concepts, I examine the blurring, substitutions, and differentiations between wild species and human migrant/foreigner/other categories with regard to public debates on conservation, migration, and identity in Poland. These accounts are significant because they promote fear and radically exclusionary concepts of belonging and are linked to acts of violence. Here I examine conflicts between fishermen and conservationists, including the inflammatory comments of an extreme nationalist politician and the illegal killings of protected Baltic grey seals.

TI  - Forage availability, supplementary feed and ungulate density: Associations with ungulate damage in pine production forests
PY  - 2022
AB  - Populations of large herbivores, including members of the deer family Cervidae, are expanding across and within many regions of the northern hemisphere. Because their browsing on trees can result in economic losses to forestry and strongly affect ecosystems, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how best to mitigate resultant damage. Previous research has highlighted the importance of regulating deer density and the availability of alternative forage to reduce browsing damage levels in conifer production stands. However, often only one or two proxies of forage availability have been used instead of applying a broad foodscape approach and more knowledge is needed to understand which types of alternative forage best mitigate damage. We conducted field inventories of damage that occurred during the previous fall/winter in 112 production stands in southern Sweden, while also measuring forage availability and cervid faecal pellets in the surrounding landscape (16 ha). Local landowners provided data on supplementary feeding. We found that variation in cervid (Alces alces, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Dama dama) browsing damage to top shoots or stems of young Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris, hereon pine), was better explained by the availability of alternative natural forage (using several indices and species of trees and shrubs) than by supplementary feeding. The proportion of damaged pine trees was higher in stands with a lower density of pine stems; in landscapes with a lower density of key broadleaf tree species (genera Sorbus, Salix, Populus and Quercus); and in landscapes with more open land (agricultural fields and paddocks). Damage was also higher in stands where relatively large amounts of moose faeces was found, while not related to the amount of faeces from other cervid species. The amount of supplementary feed (silage or other types such as root vegetables) did not explain variation in pine damage, but the result was possibly affected by relatively few study areas supplying sufficient data on supplementary feeding. The results from our inventory illustrate the efficacy of using naturally growing forage to mitigate browsing damage to young pine trees in managed landscapes. Creation of such forage is also recommended over supplementary feeding because of co-benefits to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in the migration of Ruddy-headed Goose in southern South America using satellite tagging
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ruddy-headed Goose Chloephaga rubidiceps is the smallest of the five South American sheldgeese and has two separate populations: one sedentary, which resides in the Malvinas/Falkland Islands and one migratory that overwinters mainly in the Pampas region, Argentina and breeds in Southern Patagonia. The Ruddy-headed Goose’s continental population has decreased considerably, and recent estimates indicated that the population size is less than 800 individuals. In Argentina and Chile, this population is categorised as endangered. Understanding migration across vast landscapes is essential for the identification of factors affecting the survival of this endangered population and for the application of effective conservation measures. We aim to provide the first documentation of the complete migration cycle of Ruddy-headed Goose, and to analyse their annual migration in detail, including identification of stop-over, breeding and wintering sites, and to compare migration timing during spring and autumn migration. Adults were captured in the southern Pampas and equipped with solar satellite transmitters in 2015 and 2016. We analysed the influence of season (spring vs autumn migration) on the number and duration of stop-overs, distance travelled and overall migration speed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Our results showed that tracked geese used the eastern Patagonian route to reach their breeding grounds and take the same route after breeding. Spring migration was significantly faster than autumn migration, at least based on the number of days spent in their stop-overs. Stop-overs were closer to the final destination, either during spring and autumn migrations, though some of them were not used during subsequent migrations. Our migration cartography for Ruddy-headed Geese, together with the timing and location data, should be used to improve conservation efforts directed at this species and might contribute to the modification of the current status of ‘Least Concern’ under the IUCN criteria.

TI  - Population control by means of organised hunting effort: Experiences from a voluntary goose hunting arrangement.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Implementing management objectives may be challenging when decisions are made at different scales than where they are supposed to be carried out. In this study we present a situation where local goose hunting arrangements respond to objectives in an international management plan for pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) and a local wish to reduce goose numbers as means to reduce grazing damage on farmland. A unique ten-year dataset provides an evaluation of the efficiency of voluntary actions at a local scale for implementing a policy of population control of geese, and general lessons are drawn for collaboration and co-production of knowledge for adaptive management. The study demonstrates how both the hunters and geese adapt in a situation where increasing the harvest of geese is the main objective. Introducing hunting-free days and safe foraging areas significantly increased goose numbers in the study area, with a corresponding increase in hunting success in terms of number of harvested geese. The geese's behavioural response to hunting also triggered the hunters to adapt accordingly by optimal timing and placement in the landscape. Based on the results of the present study we suggest a framework for local implementation of management actions. Bringing end-users on board, facilitates processes and strengthens the achievements, as they represent the actors where implementation occurs. Specifically, our findings demonstrate how optimal goose hunting can be practiced by the use of an adaptive framework with active stakeholder participation.

TI  - The missing lynx — understanding hunters' opposition to large carnivores
PY  - 2015
AB  - Local opposition to large carnivores is a frequent source of conflict and a major obstacle for large carnivore conservation worldwide. The aim of our study is to understand hunters' reasons for opposing large carnivores, paying particular attention to the social dimension of the conflict. In an area where a vigorous conflict about lynx (Lynx lynx) exists without there actually being individuals of this species resident, we conducted group discussions with hunters, a group that includes many lynx opponents. Results were interpreted using the theories of social identity and psychological reactance. We found that, despite the absence of large carnivores, hunters' perceptions and reasoning resembled those present in areas with resident large carnivores. This underlines the significance of the social dimension. Results show that the hunters' position in the lynx conflict is shaped by past experiences with pro-lynx groups (forestry and nature conservation). In this interaction, hunters see their social identity...

TI  - Semiochemicals and habitat manipulation to support green lacewing activity to reduce aphid infestations in agroecosystems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Conservation biological control (CBC) is a promising tool for ecological intensification that aims to establish resilient natural enemy populations that contribute to pest management with reduced use of pesticides and at the same time support native biodiversity in agroecosystems. Yet the impact of natural enemies in CBC is often limited due to missing resources such as food, habitat, and hibernation shelters. Here, we studied a CBC strategy that incorporates these essential resources combined with semiochemicals, focusing on how the common green lacewing can enhance biological control of aphids. In a 4-year field study conducted at three locations in the region of East Norway, we developed a CBC strategy combining the three measures ATTRACT (a ternary attractant that increase lacewing egg laying), FOOD (floral buffer strips), and SHELTER (insect hotels for overwintering survival) to increase aphid biological control in spring barley. We recorded the number of lacewings, ladybirds, hoverflies, parasitized aphid mummies, and the two cereal aphid species Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Our CBC strategy resulted in a significant increase in lacewing activity and significant aphid suppression. At all three locations and over the 4-year period, aphid infestation was below the economic damage threshold in the field plots using CBC measures. In contrast, during two of the years, the density of the aphid infestation in the control plots was significantly above the damage threshold. We found evidence that use of the ternary attractant supported green lacewings but led to loss of ladybirds, hoverflies, and parasitoids, even though flower strips were used as alternative resources. Our study shows a promising increase in lacewing activity in the agricultural landscape and high biological control of aphids in barley. Long-term field studies are needed to evaluate the impact on non-target species and the agroecosystem before practical application of this approach can be considered.

TI  - Rewilding Lite: Using Traditional Domestic Livestock to Achieve Rewilding Outcomes
PY  - 2021
AB  - The vision of rewilding is to return ecosystems to a “natural” or “self-willed” state with trophic complexity, dispersal (and connectivity) and stochastic disturbance in place. The concept is gaining traction, particularly in Europe where significant land abandonment has taken place in recent years. However, in reality, the purest form of rewilding (Rewilding Max) is constrained by a number of context-specific factors whereby it may not be possible to restore the native species that form part of the trophic structure of the ecosystem if they are extinct (for example, mammoths, Mammuthus spp., aurochs, Bos taurus primigenius). In addition, populations/communities of native herbivores/predators may not be able to survive or be acceptable to the public in small scale rewilding projects close to areas of high human density or agricultural land. Therefore, the restoration of natural trophic complexity and disturbance regimes within rewilding projects requires careful consideration if the broader conservation needs of society are to be met. Here we highlight the importance of herbivory as a key factor in rewilding. We argue that the use of the suite of livestock species, and in particular traditional breeds, offers the opportunity, under both land sharing/sparing strategies, to reinstate a more “natural” form of herbivory but still retain the option for management interventions (Rewilding Lite). It will even be possible to gain economic returns (ecotourism, sale of livestock products) from these systems, which will make them more acceptable to state and private landowners. We develop our case based on the advantages of using landraces versus de-domestication strategies, and on the implementation of eco-shepherding herbivory as a restoration tool in fine mosaics of agriculture/natural patches. If this approach is adopted, then larger areas can be given over to conservation, because of the potential broader benefits to society from these spaces and the engagement of farmers in practices that are closer to their traditions.

TI  - Topsoil Seed Bank as Feeding Ground for Farmland Birds: A Comparative Assessment in Agricultural Habitats
PY  - 2021
AB  - The topsoil seed bank was studied in four types of agricultural bird habitats: fields with cereals, maize, clover and tilled fields of a Mediterranean plain to determine the potentially richest habitat based on food supply for the wintering farmland birds. The diversity and abundance of topsoil seeds differed between seasons but did not differ significantly between habitats. The cereal habitat was the richest in food supply for the overwintering of farmland birds. The topsoil seed bank was dominated by Chenopodium album, Polygonum aviculare and Amaranthus retroflexus. The findings of this study provide insight for low-intensity management of higher-elevation mount agricultural areas of southern Mediterranean by preserving seed-rich habitats for farmland avifauna.

TI  - Ten-Year Responses of Underplanted Northern Red Oak to Silvicultural Treatments, Herbivore Exclusion, and Fertilization
PY  - 2018
AB  - Establishing adequate advanced oak reproduction prior to final overstory removal is crucial for regenerating oak forests in the eastern U.S. Many management approaches exist to this end, but benefits associated with any individual technique can depend on the suite of techniques employed and the geographic location. At four mixed-hardwood upland forest sites in central and southern Indiana, we tested factorial combinations of deer fencing, controlled-release fertilization, and various silvicultural techniques (midstory removal, crown thinning, and a shelterwood establishment cut) for promoting the growth and survival of underplanted red oak seedlings. Crown thinning resulted in slow growth and low survival. Midstory removal and the shelterwood establishment cut were nearly equally effective for promoting seedling growth. Seedling survival was strongly influenced by fencing, and differences in survival between silvicultural treatments were minimal when fencing was employed. Fertilization had minimal effects overall, only increasing the probability that unfenced seedlings were in competitive positions relative to surrounding vegetation. We suggest that underplanting oak seedlings can augment natural reproduction, but the practice should be accompanied by a combination of midstory removal and fencing, at a minimum, for adequate growth and survival.

TI  - Changes of Ortolan Bunting (Emberiza hortulana L.) Habitats and Implications for the Species Presence in SE Moravia, Czech Republic
PY  - 2016
AB  - The study focuses on the changes of Ortolan Bunting (Emberizia hortulana L.) habitats, which occurred during the last 20 years, and the implications of these changes for the presence of the species population in south-eastern Moravia, Czech Republic. The research was based on aerial photographs and field work. We have identified habitats that were favoured by Ortolan Bunting in the study area on the basis of expert knowledge and by spatial analysis. We found that these habitats experienced statistically significant decline in their area. The decline was steeper in the region where Ortolan Bunting occurred only in the 1990s and was smaller in the region where the bird was present from late 1990s till 2012. However, our analyses did not confirm direct relationship between the habitat changes and the decline of Ortolan Bunting population, i.e. we did not find that decline of favourable habitat significantly affected decline of the species population. The main reasons for the decrease of favourable habitats in the study area are changes in agricultural practices, especially spread of mechanisation that have caused an increase in the size of fields and a drastic reduction of groups of trees and solitary trees. Additionally, widespread grassing of vineyards and other plots as a result of integrated and organic farming contributed to the decrease of favourable habitats. Practices in the form of planting new trees and leaving parts of managed land bare to be used for mitigating the decline of the bird population were discussed.

TI  - Local perceptions of jaguar conservation and environmental justice in Goiás, Matto Grosso and Roraima states (Brazil)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Wildlife conservation often leads to various conflicts with other human activities, resulting in concerns about the justice of conservation. Although species' protection – notably of large carnivores – can have negative consequences for economic interests and human well-being, environmental justice issues related to species conservation are rarely explored. In Brazil, jaguars ( Panthera onca ) have become flagships for a series of conservation initiatives. Whereas jaguars' direct impact on cattle farming has been studied, their influence on other rural stakeholders is poorly understood. Here we study local people's views on jaguars and jaguar conservation across the Cerrado savannah and the Amazon rainforest biomes. Using Q-methodology, we identified five distinct narratives regarding jaguar conservation in relation to environmental justice issues. These were shared among fishermen, tourist guides, cattle breeders, crop farmers and jaguar hunters. Interestingly, we did not find any systematic differences in subjective views, across regions, or professions/livelihood forms. However, our results showed a strong desire among the stakeholders for more local empowerment to influence the management of both jaguars and nature where they live. Moreover, we detected a widespread discontent with the lack of consistent implementation and predictable enforcement of environmental laws.

TI  - On the Multiple Identities of Stakeholders in Wolf Management in Minnesota, United States
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Social identity theory offers a means to understand attitudes about wolves, with consequences for management support. Using data from a mail survey about wolves, we explored relationships among seven identities (i.e., wolf advocate, hunter, environmentalist, nature enthusiast, farmer, trapper, conservationist) using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA). We examined how identities correlated with political ideology, trust in a wildlife management agency, wildlife value orientations (WVOs) and attitudes about wolves, and we evaluated whether WVOs mediated the relationship between identities and attitudes. PCA suggested two factors in identifying relationships among stakeholders, while MDS and correlations found diversity among stakeholders beyond these factors. Hunter identity was most strongly associated with a domination WVO and conservative political ideology. Farmer identity was most strongly associated with agency distrust and negative wolf attitudes. Wolf advocate was most strongly associated with a mutualism WVO (i.e., beliefs that humans are meant to coexist in harmonious relationships with wildlife), agency trust, and positive wolf attitudes. Conservationist identity was positively correlated with all other identities. WVOs partially mediated the relationship between identities and attitudes.</jats:p>

TI  - Historical Arable Land Change in an Eco-Fragile Area: A Case Study in Zhenlai County, Northeastern China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Long-term land changes are cumulatively a major driver of global environmental change. Historical land-cover/use change is important for assessing present landscape conditions and researching ecological environment issues, especially in eco-fragile areas. Arable land is one of the land types influenced by human agricultural activity, reflecting human effects on land-use and land-cover change. This paper selected Zhenlai County, which is part of the farming–pastoral zone of northern China, as the research region. As agricultural land transformation goes with the establishment of settlements, in this research, the historical progress of land transformation in agricultural areas was analyzed from the perspective of settlement evolution, and the historical reconstruction of arable land was established using settlement as the proxy between their inner relationships, which could be reflected by the farming radius. The results show the following. (1) There was little land transformation from nonagricultural areas into agricultural areas until the Qing government lifted the ban on cultivation and mass migration accelerated the process, which was most significant during 1907–1912; (2) The overall trend of land transformation in this region is from northeast to southwest; (3) Taking the topographic maps as references, the spatial distribution of the reconstructed arable land accounts for 47.79% of the maps. When this proxy-based reconstruction method is applied to other regions, its limitations should be noticed. It is important to explore the research of farming radius calculations based on regional characteristics. To achieve land-system sustainability, long-term historical land change trajectories and characteristics should be applied to future policy making.

TI  - Wildness and the Preconditions for Meaningfulness of Nature
PY  - 2019
AB  - Wildness is a term playing a key role in modern environmentalism. Wild entities, understood as self-organizing and self-willed, while pursuing their own unique forms of flourishing, can be disruptive with respect to human interests and desires. However, so defined wildness can be seen to have its own good, and as such it demands of us respect and even admiration of its own forms of self-realization. This is a most obvious preservationist way of understanding the role of ecological discomforts in human life. However, an alternative is proposed, which refers to the fundamental features of human meaning-making. Human search for meaning is dependent upon encountering an external world independent from us. An entity is determined as truly external only when it has the potential to negate our search for meaning. In as much as a significant element of ecological discomforts is connected to the capacity of wild nature to negate our desires, it is only such potentially discomforting nature that can be considered truly external. Consequently, it is proposed that in the context of the Anthropocene, it is only the potentially disruptive nature that can become truly meaningful element of human lives.

TI  - Cultural values and sustainable forest management: the case of Europe
PY  - 2015
AB  - The European continent still has a rich heritage of rural landscapes built up over thousands of years. The UNESCO-sCBD Florence Declaration of 2014, describes it as being predominantly a biocultural landscape, as it assimilates economic, social, cultural, and environmental processes in time and space. This definition also includes the forests, which have been affected by several centuries of human action and are also a part of the European cultural heritage. However, an approach to forest landscapes often employing the same tools used for nature conservation has led to a definition of management tools mostly based on ecological characteristics. The origin of forests and woodlands is rarely interpreted as the result of human activities and protected and managed accordingly. The three pillars on which Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in Europe are based are ecological values, economic values, and sociocultural values. However, no political resolutions requiring countries to develop strategies and carry out actions for the preservation of cultural forests have been developed so far. The fact that cultural values currently play a limited role in SFM indicates the scant consideration given to the role of culture and history, as well as the lack of a comprehensive landscape approach. Failure to effectively and coherently address culture and history may very well be an emerging weakness that needs to be reconciled, especially now that the landscape approach is proposed on a global scale as a new perspective for sustainable development. One of the consequences of this failure has been the widespread application of an idea of ‘naturalness’ to places that are not natural, threatening the conservation of the cultural identity of local populations and the historical values of forests, and favoring processes of abandonment and renaturalization. The present paper advocates the practical implementation of existing tools for protecting cultural forest landscapes, such as the MCPFE Guidelines for Social and Cultural Values in SFM and the UNESCO-sCBD Florence Declaration.

TI  - Considering behavioral state when predicting habitat use: Behavior-specific spatial models for the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle
PY  - 2022
AB  - Effective planning for species conservation often requires an understanding of habitat use. The resources an animal selects within the landscape relate to its behavioral state and, therefore, incorporating behavior into habitat selection analyses can help inform management of threatened species. Here we present an approach for developing behavior-specific spatial habitat-use models using large quantities of GPS telemetry data. Using hidden Markov models, we first characterize 231,478 GPS fixes from 22 recently fledged endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax fleayi) as reflective of either perching, short-distance flight, or long-distance flight. We then use a multivariate habitat selection ratio to develop spatial models predicting where these behavioral states occur. Recently fledged Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles selected for areas close to forest edges during perching and short distance flights, whereas they selected more strongly for areas with steep topography (slopes > 15°) and further from forest edges for longer flights. Models using distance to forest edge and topographic slope effectively predicted where eagles engaged in long flights (R2 > 0.91, rs > 0.90) in each of six regions, whereas the performance varied by region for models describing perching (R2 = 0.43–0.97, rs = 0.80–0.97) and short flights (R2 = 0.34–0.93, rs = 0.63–1.00). Our study provides a detailed understanding of habitat use by young Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, which has multiple applications in the ongoing conservation of the population. Our method illustrates a framework for spatially explicit and behavior-specific habitat selection analyses that can be applied to other species of conservation concern.

TI  - Adolescents' beliefs about the wolf: investigating the potential of human-wolf coexistence in the European South.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Previous research revealed a rural–urban divide in the acceptance of the wolf. We investigated adolescents’ beliefs about the wolf in rural and urban areas of Greece and Italy. By using a multiple-choice questionnaire, we attempted to reconstruct the conflictual nature of opposing beliefs about the wolf. For each item, there was one choice indicating a “pro-wolf” stance, one corresponding to an “anti-wolf” disposition, and a third, “neutral” choice. Respondents were clustered in a “pro-wolf,” an “anti-wolf,” and a “neutral” group. Rural or urban residence did not affect the classification of participants. Average responses for each cluster did reveal some degree of dispersal over rival positions. The permeability of “pro-wolf,” “anti-wolf,” and “neutral” positions might be regarded as a manifestation of the phenomenon of “cognitive polyphasia,” which refers to the cohabitation of inconsistent or contradictory beliefs. Implications for environmental education and outreach campaigns are discussed.

TI  - Identification of salmon population bottlenecks from low flows in a hydro-regulated river
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Flow regime alterations from hydropower regulation may impact fish populations. Impacts can be characterized using methods for mapping bottlenecks for different species life stages. Improving the understanding of such bottlenecks could provide a basis for mitigation measures. An integrated modelling approach coupling a salmon population model (IB-salmon), a hydraulic 1D model (HEC-RAS) and a temperature model (Air2Stream) was used to identify the bottlenecks constraining the salmon population in a hydro-regulated river (Ljungan River, Sweden). This integrated approach evaluated changes in the salmon population under different low flow scenarios, involving potential dewatering of spawning sites, and the effect of restored spawning sites. Model results demonstrated that low discharges in winter and summer were potential hydrological bottlenecks for the salmon population, particularly in winter due to potential dewatering of spawning sites. Restoration of spawning sites increased salmon production under all scenarios, posing a potential counter measure against low flows.

TI  - Proportion of charcoal carbon in the forest floor carbon pool in relation to fire history in a boreal forest landscape
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Fire in the boreal forests emits substantial amounts of organically bound carbon (C) to the atmosphere and converts a fraction of the burnt organic matter into charcoal, which in turn is highly refractory and functions as a long‐term stable C pool. It is well established that the boreal forest charcoal pool is sufficiently large to play a significant role in the global C cycle. However, there is a need for spatially representative estimates of how large proportions of the forest floor C pool are made up of charcoal across different plant communities in the boreal forest ecosystem. Thus, we have quantified the amounts of C separately in charcoal and the organic layers of the forest floor across fine spatial scales in a boreal forest landscape with a well‐documented fire history. We found that the proportion of charcoal C made up an average of 1.2% of the total forest floor C, and the charcoal proportions showed a high small‐scale spatial variability and were concentrated in the organic–mineral soil interface. Proportions of charcoal C decreased with increasing time since last fire. Deeper soils, denser soils, and local concave areas had the highest proportions of charcoal C, whereas historical fire frequencies and current differences in vegetation did not relate to the proportions of charcoal C.</jats:p>

TI  - Outlaws or Protected? DNA, Hybrids, and Biopolitics in a Finnish Wolf-Poaching Case
PY  - 2018
AB  - By analyzing a 2015 Finnish court case on wolf poaching, we discuss how wild animals are categorized, gain legal status based on their species identification, and affect the categorization of humans either as poachers or hunters concerned about the genetic purity of the species. The court had to evaluate the reliability, accuracy, and relevance of scientific knowledge to distinguish “pure” wolves from hybrids. Dealing with complicated questions of canid species identification, the court decision took a position in the debate on what to conserve in a world which escapes simple categorizations. Hence, we interpret the case as an example of biopolitics , addressing the challenges and tensions of governing life by differentiating between valued and less valued, killable and threatened lifeforms, and human responsibilities towards them.

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>We assessed the effect of ground fires on the success of advanced regeneration of tree species on gentle hilly ridges of terminal moraines of the North-Eastern part of the Leningrad Region. To study the juvenile generation of tree species, we carried out a reconnaissance survey of transects in the forest areas affected by wildfires. The forest stands were 10–12 years old. The stem numbers and heights of the regenerating tree species were recorded. The correlation analysis was used to determine the degree of influence of external factors on forest regeneration, including soil conditions and the burnt area size. We found differences in the species composition of stands with a predominance of deciduous and coniferous species depending on soil and hydrological conditions. We also found a relationship between soil factors and spruce and pine regeneration size in stands with a predominance of coniferous and deciduous species. The soil granulometric composition influenced proportions of coniferous and deciduous trees in post-fire stands. Using the knowledge obtained about the stand composition, we can forecast the future development of forest stands and prescribe the optimal forest management regimes.</jats:p>

TI  - The origins of prescribed burning in Scandinavian forestry: the seminal role of Joel Wretlind in the management of fire-dependent forests
PY  - 2019
AB  - In Sweden, prescribed burning was trialed as early as the 1890s for forest regeneration purposes. However, the origins of prescribed burning in Sweden are commonly attributed to Joel Efraim Wretlind, forest manager in the State Forest district of Mala, Vasterbotten County, from 1920 to 1952. To more fully understand the role he played in the development of prescribed burning and the extent of his burning, we examined historical records from the State Forest Company’s archive and Wretlind’s personal archive. The data showed that at least 11,208 ha was burned through prescribed burning between 1921 and 1970, representing 18.7% of the Mala state-owned forest area. Wretlind thus created a new forestry-driven fire regime, reaching, during peak years, extents close to historical fire regimes before the fire suppression era, and much higher than present-day burning. His use of prescribed fire to regenerate forests served as a guide for many other forest managers, spreading to all of northern Sweden during the 1950–1960s. Our analysis of Wretlind’s latest accounts also shows how he stood against the evolutions of modern forestry to defend a forestry system based on the reproduction of natural processes, such as fire.

TI  - Using Red List species in designating protection status to forest areas: a case study on the problem of spatio-temporal dynamics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Red-listed species are often used as target species in selection of sites for conservation. However, limitations to their use have been pointed out, and here we address the problem of expected high spatio-temporal dynamics of red-listed species. We used species data (vascular plants, bryophytes, macrolichens and polypore fungi) from two inventories 17 years apart to estimate temporal turnover of red-listed and non-red-listed species in two forest areas (147 and 195 ha) and of plots (0.25 ha) within each area. Furthermore, we investigated how turnover of species affected the rank order of plots regarding richness of red-listed species, using two different national Red List issues (1998 and 2015). In both study areas, temporal turnover was substantial, despite minor changes in the overall number of species. At plot level, temporal turnover in red-listed species was higher than in non-red-listed species, but similar to non-red-listed species of the same frequency of occurrence. Adding the effect of changing identities of species red-listed according to the two Red List issues, further increased the estimated spatio-temporal dynamics. Recorded spatio-temporal turnover also resulted in substantial changes in the rank order of plots regarding richness of red-listed species. Using rare red-listed species for site selection may therefore be accompanied by a higher loss of conservation effectiveness over time than for more common species, and particularly at finer scales.

TI  - A 2-million-year-old ecosystem in Greenland uncovered by environmental DNA.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene epochs 3.6 to 0.8 million years ago<sup>1</sup> had climates resembling those forecasted under future warming<sup>2</sup>. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary values<sup>3,4</sup>. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare<sup>5</sup>. Here we report an ancient environmental DNA<sup>6</sup> (eDNA) record describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees, as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many of which had not previously been detected at the site from macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from two million years ago using ancient eDNA.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis for invasive species control: the case of greater Canada goose Branta canadensis in Flanders (northern Belgium)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background Sound decisions on control actions for established invasive alien species (IAS) require information on ecological as well as socio-economic impact of the species and of its management. Cost-benefit analysis provides part of this information, yet has received relatively little attention in the scientific literature on IAS. Methods We apply a bio-economic model in a cost-benefit analysis framework to greater Canada goose Branta canadensis, an IAS with documented social, economic and ecological impacts in Flanders (northern Belgium). We compared a business as usual (BAU) scenario which involved non-coordinated hunting and egg destruction with an enhanced scenario based on a continuation of these activities but supplemented with coordinated capture of moulting birds. To assess population growth under the BAU scenario we fitted a logistic growth model to the observed pre-moult capture population. Projected damage costs included water eutrophication and damage to cultivated grasslands and were calculated for all scenarios. Management costs of the moult captures were based on a representative average of the actual cost of planning and executing moult captures. Results Comparing the scenarios with different capture rates, different costs for eutrophication and various discount rates, showed avoided damage costs were in the range of 21.15 M€ to 45.82 M€ under the moult capture scenario. The lowest value for the avoided costs applied to the scenario where we lowered the capture rate by 10%. The highest value occurred in the scenario where we lowered the real discount rate from 4% to 2.5%. Discussion The reduction in damage costs always outweighed the additional management costs of moult captures. Therefore, additional coordinated moult captures could be applied to limit the negative economic impact of greater Canada goose at a regional scale. We further discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and its potential application to other IAS.

TI  - Fighting talk: Organisational discourses of the conflict over raptors and grouse moor management in Scotland
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Conflict is currently one of the greatest challenges facing wildlife conservation. Whilst conflicts may first appear to concern wildlife, they are often embedded within wider debates surrounding land use, land ownership, and the governance of natural resources. Disputes over the impacts or management of a species therefore become symbols for conflicts that are fundamentally between the divergent interests and values of the people involved. NGOs representing the interests of local stakeholders can become actors within the conflict, often utilising publicly available platforms such as websites and social media in an attempt to influence over others and gain a dominant foothold in the debate. Here, we examined discourses of organisations in relation to a contentious and high-profile case of conflict in Scotland, that occurs between interests of raptor conservation and grouse moor management. News articles sourced from the websites of six organisations – identified as key voices in the debate – were subjected to discourse analysis. 36 storylines were drawn from common phrases and statements within the text. Storylines demonstrated a clear divide in the discourse; organisations differed not only in their portrayal of central issues, but also in their representation of other actors. Discourses were strategic; organisations interpreted the situation in ways that either supported their own interests and agendas, or damaged the image of opposing parties. We argue that discursive contestation at this level could be damaging to mitigation efforts – widening barriers between stakeholders and risking already fragile relationships. This in turn reduces the likelihood of consensus and impacts on successful decision-making and policy implementation. We conclude that conflict managers should be aware of the contestation between high-profile actors, and the ramifications this may have for conflict mitigation processes. An understanding of what constitutes these discourses should therefore be used as a foundation to improve dialogue and collaborative management.

TI  - Recent and Predicted Changes in Habitat of the Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis Based on the Link between the Land Cover and the Field Survey Based Abundance Data
PY  - 2019
AB  - The European avifauna on agricultural land has been permanently diminished over the past few decades. This phenomenon is clearly connected with agricultural intensification and the recent land cover changes. The main aims of this study were to identify the land cover preferences of a farmland bird species, the Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis in Hungary and investigate the link between the recent trend of the abundance of this species and the land-cover change. We employed GIS and statistical methods to assess the link between the abundance of this species based on the Hungarian common bird monitoring database (MMM) and the spatial proportion of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) categories in different buffer zones with 300, 600 and 1200 m from the observation points. Based on the significant statistical connections, we could identify and select land cover categories that serve as habitats and land cover categories that this bird species does not inhabit. The land cover preference of the Eurasian Skylark, in case of some land cover category, is depending on the grain scale (circle radius distance from the observation points). In analyses arable lands has been omitted because this land cover type is the well-known habitat of the species. According to our results, the Eurasian Skylark prefers permanent crops (vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations) inside 600m and 1200m buffer zones, and pastures inside 1200m buffer zones, while it does not prefer urban fabric areas and heterogeneous agricultural, forests, and wetlands or water bodies inside 300m and 600m, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation associations (transitional woodland-shrub and natural grassland areas) inside the 600m and 1200m radius buffer areas. The identification of these regional (European level) land-cover categories allowed us to analyse the recent (1990–2012) and the predicted (2006–2050) characteristics of habitat changes of this bird species, associated with land cover change. Based on our results, we could estimate that the Skylark habitat will decrease by 188 560 ha between 2006–2050 in Hungary.

TI  - Global characterization factors for terrestrial biodiversity impacts of future land inundation in Life Cycle Assessment.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for analyzing and comparing environmental impacts of products throughout their life cycles, facilitating shifts towards more environmentally friendly products. However, LCA does currently not address terrestrial biodiversity impacts related to the conversion of terrestrial habitat into aquatic habitat. This conversion can occur because of sea level rise, establishment of new land-based aquaculture, as well as reservoir expansion or creation. Here, we focus on land occupation and terrestrial biodiversity impacts, while transformation impacts, and habitat gain for aquatic species were beyond the scope of the study. To be able to estimate the regional and global terrestrial biodiversity impacts of future land occupation from terrestrial to aquatic habitat in LCA, we developed new characterization factors (CFs) for 781 terrestrial ecoregions, 5 land cover/use types, and 4 taxonomic groups. The basis for the development of the proposed CFs is the model concept of the currently recommended method for quantifying land use impacts on biodiversity in LCA by the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by United Nations Environmental Program. The global CFs vary between 7.44 E−20 PDF/m2 and 6.25 E−09 PDF/m2, showing that a highly variable terrestrial biodiversity impact of land inundation between land cover/use types, taxonomic groups and ecoregions exists.

TI  - Species’ habitat use inferred from environmental variables at multiple scales: How much we gain from high-resolution vegetation data?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Spatial resolution of environmental data may influence the results of habitat selection models. As high-resolution data are usually expensive, an assessment of their contribution to the reliability of habitat models is of interest for both researchers and managers. We evaluated how vegetation cover datasets of different spatial resolutions influence the inferences and predictive power of multi-scale habitat selection models for the endangered brown bear populations in the Cantabrian Range (NW Spain). We quantified the relative performance of three types of datasets: (i) coarse resolution data from Corine Land Cover (minimum mapping unit of 25 ha), (ii) medium resolution data from the Forest Map of Spain (minimum mapping unit of 2.25 ha and information on forest canopy cover and tree species present in each polygon), and (iii) high-resolution Lidar data (about 0.5 points/m 2 ) providing a much finer information on forest canopy cover and height. Despite all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80), the predictive ability of multi-scale models significantly increased with spatial resolution, particularly when other predictors of habitat suitability (e.g. human pressure) were not used to indirectly filter out areas with a more degraded vegetation cover. The addition of fine grain information on forest structure (LiDAR) led to a better understanding of landscape use and a more accurate spatial representation of habitat suitability, even for a species with large spatial requirements as the brown bear, which will result in the development of more effective measures to assist endangered species conservation.

TI  - Fire Occurrence in Hemi-Boreal Forests: Exploring Natural and Cultural Scots Pine Fire Regimes Using Dendrochronology in Lithuania
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Fire is an important natural disturbance and a driver of hemi-boreal forest successional trajectories, structural complexity, and biodiversity. Understanding the historic fire regime is an important step towards sustainable forest management. Focusing on Lithuania’s hemi-boreal forests, we first mapped the potential natural fire regimes based on the relationship between site conditions, vegetation, and fire frequency using the ASIO model. The ASIO model revealed that all the fire frequency categories (Absent, Seldom, Intermittent, Often) are found in Lithuania. Scots pine forests dominated the often fire frequency category (92%). Secondly, focusing on a fire-prone forest landscape, Dzūkija, we analyzed the fire occurrence of Scots pine forest types using dendrochronological records. We sampled and cross-dated 132 Scots pine samples with fire scars from four dry forest stands (n = 92) and four peatland forest stands (n = 40), respectively. In total, the fire history analysis revealed 455 fire scars and 213 fire events during the period of 1742–2019. The Weibull median fire intervals were 2.7 years (range 1–34) for the dry forest types and 6.3 years (range 1–27) for the peatland forest types. Analysis pre- and post-1950 showed the Weibull median fire interval increased from 2.2 to 7.2 for the dry forest types but decreased from 6.2 to 5.2. for the peatland forest types. A superposed epoch analysis revealed significant precipitation fluxes prior to the fire events after 1950. Thus, the Dzūkija landscape of Lithuania has been strongly shaped by both human and naturally induced fires. The combination of theory (the ASIO model) with the examination of biological archives can be used to help guide sustainable forest management to emulate forest disturbances related to fire. As traditional forest management focusing on wood production has eliminated fire, and effectively simplified forest ecosystems, we recommend introducing educational programs to communicate the benefits and history of forest fires as well as adaptive management trials that use low-intensity prescribed burning of Scots pine stands.</jats:p>

TI  - Historical fire regimes of North American hemiboreal peatlands
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Peatlands contain one-third to one-half of global soil carbon, and disturbances, specifically fire, directly influence these carbon stocks. Despite this, historical variability of peatland fire regimes is largely unknown. This gap in knowledge partly stems from reconstructions of peatland fire regimes with methods limited to evaluating infrequent, severe fire events and not capturing frequent, low-severity events. Furthermore, variability in fire regimes is likely higher in heterogenous landscapes like the hemiboreal subzone, the transition between boreal and temperate biomes, where peatlands are embedded in landscapes including forests with high proportions of fire-dependent species, such as red pine (Pinus resinosa), that are well adapted to frequent low-severity fires. Here, we sought to evaluate the role of low- and moderate-severity fires within hemiboreal peatlands in central North America to better understand historical variability in fire regimes. We reconstructed historical fire regimes using fine-scale (temporal and spatial) dendrochronology methods to estimate frequency of low- and moderate-severity fires, identify synchronous fire events among forested uplands within and surrounding individual peatlands as well as among sites, and assess fire-climate relationships. We collected 220 cross-sections or partial-tree sections within three poor fen peatlands across the Great Lakes Region. Using standard dendrochronological techniques, we crossdated 129 samples, assigning dates to 414 fire scars (128 unique fire years) comprising a 500-year tree-ring record (1520–2019). Prior to the mid-1900s, fire events were frequent and widespread within peatlands we evaluated, with mean fire return intervals (MFRI) ranging from 7 to 31 years. Fire events were also synchronous among forested uplands within and surrounding peatlands. Fires predominantly occurred in the dormant and latewood (growing season) positions and during regionally dry conditions corresponding to mild and moderate drought (Palmer Drought Severity Index ≥ −2.99) but interestingly not during regionally severe drought (Palmer Drought Severity Index ≤ −3.00). While large-scale, high-severity fires are important to the ecology of peatlands and to changing climate-fire interactions, our results suggest that widespread low- to moderate-severity fires were historically frequent in hemiboreal peatlands and likely central to their development and maintenance. Evaluating whether peatlands will continue to be carbon sinks or become carbon sources due to climate change requires an understanding of the inherent variability in fire regimes, especially in hemiboreal systems.

TI  - How children in northern Canada represent the wolverine through drawings
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study explores the perception of wolverines, a carnivore in decline, by youths in northern Canada, the future generation of stakeholders. To accomplish this, we analysed 165 drawings from children and 22 interviews with Indigenous adults in the Northwest Territories and Quebec. Overall, children primarily drew wolverines in healthy environments, with only a minority depicting the wolverine’s environment negatively. All children demonstrated a basic understanding of the wolverine’s physical appearance and biology/ecology, with few differences in how the wolverine was depicted among the different research areas. Among interviewed adults, the ecological role played by wolverines was less prominent among the themes explored by Naskapi participants than was their role as a thief or pest, when contrasted to Dene participants. These results indicate that information about wolverine habitat or biology is still being acquired by children in areas where wolverines are extirpated, but that a lack of exposure to this species may negatively influence children’s understanding of its ecological role. These results suggest that informing the public about this carnivore’s ecological role may improve public support and, therefore, the likelihood of successful conservation programmes.

TI  - Hunter opinions on the management of migratory geese: a case of stakeholder involvement in adaptive harvest management
PY  - 2018
AB  - Knowledge of hunter attitudes toward goose management is essential for the involvement of hunters in adaptive harvest management. Our study provides insight into processes of stakeholder involvement in adaptive harvest management, as demonstrated by the case of implementing the International Species Management Plan for the Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus). We conducted an online survey among goose hunters in Norway in the main autumn staging area of this species, Nord-Trondelag, which is also the area in which most geese are harvested nationally. Our results demonstrated that a majority of these hunters see themselves as active participants in management. These hunters expressed a willingness to support management objectives through the delivery of daily harvest reports and by complying with regulations, as defined by national wildlife authorities and the international management plan.

TI  - Preadaptative Transactions and Institutional Change: Wolf‐critical activism in southwestern Finland
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Finland has had problems protecting the grey wolf (<jats:italic>Canis lupus</jats:italic>) for decades. Over the past few years, the government of Finland has taken several steps to improve its policy on wolves. In this paper, we explore the grassroots activism that institutional adjustments have triggered. This work builds on ethnographic presence in two southwestern Finnish wolf territories. Theoretically, we draw from institutional theory and use transactions as the unit of analysis. We identify four ways in which wolf‐critical civil society has provided an institutional basis for particular changes: (i) questioning the purity of the wolf, (ii) making scientific evidence fallible, (iii) producing negative emotional effects and (iv) maintaining strong policy pressure against the presence of the wolf. In the discussion, we explain how these modifications have functioned. Actors critical of the wolf have exercised the politics of disturbance, produced various epistemic cues and created conditions for reframing existing rights and the emergence of new ones. Due to these bottom‐up preadaptive transactions, wolf‐policy‐related institutional adjustments have, in many respects, taken on volitional and spontaneous features.

TI  - Evaluating the use of old cadastral maps
PY  - 2022
AB  - The old cadastral maps of the Spanish General Directorate for Cadastre (DGC) have always been in great demand. It was decided in 2012 to make an initial inventory of these maps with the type of information available, physical location, and condition. Subsequently, to evaluate their possible use, the inventory was examined to investigate whether these maps could be geographically referenced and made available on a geoportal. Several years later, it was determined that the inventory needed to be updated with a series of improvements (expanding the fields so that they become clearer, homogeneous, and more easily handled by software). A questionnaire was issued to technical specialists on property boundaries. As a principal conclusion we can highlight that the use of old cadastral maps in Spain is of great importance. The information on these maps is widely demanded by technical and legal experts who consider that an update and revision of the DGC inventory is essential. It is crucial that old cadastral maps are digitised and made available online, preferably free of charge and through an easy-to-use geoportal. The information on these maps helps to resolve property boundary disputes and has many other uses. Investment in the economic and human resources needed to preserve and publish these maps is essential given their great value.

TI  - Intensity of Stripping and Sugar Content in the Bark and the Bast of European Beech (Fagus Sylvatica).
PY  - 2019
AB  - The choice of particular trees for stripping by deer is puzzling because a preference is observed for trees of the highest social class. Trees ranked highest in the stand can produce more carbohydrates as a product of carbon assimilation. Among the many important nutrient and defense groups of metabolites in plants, high sugar content is postulated to be an attractant due to its impact on the sense of taste of different herbivores. Thus, we hypothesize that the carbohydrate content in the bast of the European beech is the most important factor by which deer make their choice. Our aim was to assess whether the sugar content in the bark and in the bast can be a factor which influences the intensity of bark stripping of particular trees in a beech thicket by red deer. A single episode connected with tree damaging pertained to 7% of the trees on the analyzed sampling plots. In total, 27% of the trees were damaged, including old damages. The mean size of damage to a given tree equaled 36% of the tree's circumference and 0.06 m2 of the trunk's surface. Analysis of the sugar content in the bast and in the bark jointly indicates that the trees subjected to bark stripping possessed a distinctly higher sugar content than the trees which were not damaged. The probability of bark stripping grows together with an increase in the sugar content of the bark and of the bast.

TI  - Landscape selection by migratory geese: implications for hunting organisation
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:p>Over the last decades, many wild goose populations have increased significantly and are now causing conflicts with socioeconomic and biological interests. To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pink‐footed geese <jats:italic>Anser brachyrhynchus</jats:italic> and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord‐Trøndelag County, mid‐Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.</jats:p>

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes (1945–2020) in a Grazed Landscape of Northern Greece, in Relation to Socioeconomic Changes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The spatiotemporal changes of the grazed Greek landscapes in the last 75 years resemble those evidenced in most parts of the northern Mediterranean region, where woody vegetation encroached on open areas changing landscape structure and diversity. These landscape transitions are deeply influenced by demographic and socioeconomic changes that exacerbate the abandonment of traditional management practices including livestock farming and wood harvesting. The aim of this paper was to examine the spatiotemporal changes regarding land use/land cover (LULC) types in a typical grazed landscape of the Lagadas area in northern Greece in the period 1945–2020 and try to associate them with socioeconomic changes. Special attention was given to grassland evolution. Cartographic material in various forms, such as historic (LULC) data sets in shapefile format (1945, 1960 and 1993), recent land use maps (Corine Land Cover of 2018), and satellite images (Google Earth images from 2017 to 2020) was analyzed with Geographic Information Systems software and landscape metrics. Socioeconomic inventory data and grazing animal numbers were also collected and analyzed from diachronic census reports of Greek authorities. Spatiotemporal changes in the Lagadas landscape showed that grasslands, open shrublands and silvopastoral areas decreased during the examined period in favor of dense shrublands and forests, causing a significant reduction in landscape diversity and heterogeneity. Main demographic and socioeconomic drivers were the decrease of the local population, population aging and a significant reduction of employment in the primary economic sector over time. These changes were coupled with reductions in the number of grazing animals (sheep, goats, and cattle), firewood harvesting and charcoal production and were identified as the main reasons for landscape change. Grasslands have become increasingly fragmented and isolated over the years. Future sustainable livestock husbandry in the area is seriously threatened by the ongoing reduction of grasslands and open shrublands.</jats:p>

PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Many attempts have been made worldwide to implement community-based conservation to gain a more inclusive protection of biological diversity and ecosystem services. In a recent national reform, the management of protected areas was devolved from the Norwegian government to local conservation boards. The main goals were to reduce local resistance toward conservation and ameliorate threats to biodiversity. We assessed the attainment of these goals a decade after implementation. We synthesized literature published since the onset of the reform and results from a survey (N = 936). Despite the limited inclusion of stakeholders and experience-based knowledge by local conservation boards, survey data show that community-based conservation arrangements are supported by residents. Conservation has been tailored to the local context by balancing sustainable use and protection, but there are some discontent with the opportunities for rural development. Managers report that biological diversity is threatened in 27% of the protected areas. Climate change and increased visitation are major conservation challenges that need to be addressed by the boards, but their mandate and capacity appear inadequate to cope with these challenges. Few studies have evaluated the conservation impact of the reform and we therefore suggest this as a priority for future research.

TI  - Land Use Changes in Czechia 1845–2010
PY  - 2015
AB  - The history of land use changes on the Czech territory since the very beginning is outlined; each subchapter deals with one important historical period. The emergence of organized agriculture (Neolithic revolution) is seen as the first period when humans began to influence nature on a certain scale. For thousands of years, however, land use changes were largely limited to inhabited lowlands. The transition from wilderness towards largely agricultural landscape accelerated only during the German plantation (eleventh–fourteenth centuries) when many forests were cleared in the frontier. As a whole, however, changes were rather modest until the eighteenth century. Really important economic and social changes that fundamentally influenced land use patterns have been taking place since the eve of Industrial Revolution. In that time, agricultural society was being gradually transformed into the industrial one at the beginning of the 20th century. The second half of the nineteenth century brought general modernization; agricultural land and arable land expanded to maximum. Since the turn of nineteenth and twentieth centuries, however, reverse trends are recorded: decrease of agricultural land (due to more intensive farming) and gradual expansion of forests. Land use patterns during the twentieth century were much influenced by turbulent political events like Czechoslovak independence (1918), World War II (1939–1945), Communist coup d’etat (1948), and restoration of democratic conditions (1989). The Communist legacy included outdated technology and production-oriented agriculture that could not compete on the international markets. The post-Communist period brought restitution of confiscated property (including land) and return to market-oriented conditions. In the most recent period, the accession of Czechia to European Union (2004) has also had profound effects on land use changes.

TI  - Cross-Border Comparison of Non-Forest Woody Vegetation in the White Carpathians (Central Europe) Over Last 65 Years
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Landscape structure is determined by human activities and natural processes. Despite both influences are described in many studies, there remains still question, how the landscape structure reflects the individual socio-economic predictors. To answer this question we compared landscape structure, with emphasis on non-forest woody vegetation, of two states, however, with common socio-economic and political history. Non-forest woody vegetation represents characteristic feature in rural landscape, which increases water retention, biodiversity and bio-migration using green structures. In our study we supposed, that non-forest woody vegetation will have high sensitivity to societal changes and nature conservation measures. On an example of border region in former Czechoslovakia we compared three classes of non-forest woody vegetation (solitaires, patches and linear elements) in three time horizons (1950, 1986, 2011). The most significant differences in spatial structure of non-forest woody vegetation between countries were in the number and area of solitaires, which decreased during the entire period. However, the largest solitaire decrease was in 1950-1986, mainly in correspondence with socialist collective farming. Moreover, the decrease was higher in the Slovak part compared to the Czech part. The primary reason for this was the removal of non-forest woody vegetation on one side and the joining crowns into bigger patches on the other side. The current trend of increasing area of patch and linear elements is related to natural succession. We assume that the main drivers of different development in non-forest woody vegetation in the border region after the split of Czechoslovakia were different management measures applied in nature and landscape conservation and social development.</jats:p>

TI  - The wolf (canis lupus) as a symbol of an urban-rural divide? Results from a media discourse analysis on the human-wolf conflict in Germany.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Given that wolves have been extinct in Germany for approximately 150 years, their return and growing population over the last decade has caused intense discussion and conflict. To develop a widely accepted and just coexistence between humans and wolves, a comprehensive understanding of the conflict is needed. There are indications that the conflict goes beyond dealing with the wolf population and marks a spatial-cultural divide between urban and rural areas. Nevertheless, the social dimensions of the human-wolf conflict in Germany have been little studied. The aim of this paper is to narrow this gap by means of a media discourse analysis including reader comments in order to provide insights into the constituent elements of this conflict. We conducted a qualitative content analysis. The sample comprises articles (n = 63) and reader comments (n = 515) over a period of one year (5/2018-5/2019) from six online periodicals in Germany. The results support the assumption of an urban-rural divide in terms of perspectives and values. The discourse indicates that rural actors who are most affected by the wolves' vicinity have more negative attitudes towards them. At the same time, they feel abandoned and dominated by urban perspectives and politics. In addition, linkages to right-wing populist positions and conspiracy narratives that can be interpreted as a consequence of political alienation are found.

TI  - Boundary organisations between conservation and development: insights from Oulanka National Park, Finland
PY  - 2013
AB  - Integrated conservation and development objectives are increasingly sought with protected area - sustainable tourism partnerships, and related certifications are promising to deliver integrated targets. However, in this article we show that European wide PAN Parks certification seems not to be supporting integrated objectives from the point of view of traditional nature users in Oulanka National Park, Finland. We compared the actions and responses of the certification, park management and traditional nature users in relation to mutually recognised issues: reindeer herding, hunting and predator management. Park management worked in many respects as a successful boundary organisation maintaining traditional rights against threats posed by standardisation practises of the certification, which emphasises conservation of wilderness with 'sell nature in order to save it' - logic. While successful in maintaining traditional rights, problems in boundary work existed in relation to the use of concepts that see traditional nature uses as a threat by default, communication and transparency, and distribution of benefits and burdens. Through examining existing and potential positive roles that park managements can have as boundary organisations, we argue that state-based park managements can mediate neoliberal standardisation efforts and harness their benefits while decreasing potential negative development outcomes in protected area governance.

TI  - Large carnivore habitat suitability modelling for Romania and associated predictions for protected areas.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat characteristics associated with species occurrences represent important baseline information for wildlife management and conservation, but have rarely been assessed for countries recently joining the EU. We used footprint tracking data and landscape characteristics in Romania to investigate the occurrence of brown bear (Ursus arctos), gray wolf (Canis lupus) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and to compare model predictions between Natura 2000 and national-level protected areas (gap analysis). Wolves were more likely to occur where rugged terrain was present. Increasing proportion of forest was positively associated with occurrence of all large carnivores, but forest type (broadleaf, mixed, or conifer) generally varied with carnivore species. Areas where cultivated lands were extensive had little suitable habitat for lynx, whereas bear occurrence probability decreased with increasing proportion of built areas. Pastures were positively associated with wolf and lynx occurrence. Brown bears occurred primarily where national roads with high traffic volumes were at low density, while bears and lynx occurred at medium-high densities of communal roads that had lower traffic volumes. Based on predictions of carnivore distributions, natural areas protected in national parks were most suitable for carnivores, nature parks were less suitable, whereas EU-legislated Natura 2000 sites had the lowest probability of carnivore presence. Our spatially explicit carnivore habitat suitability predictions can be used by managers to amend borders of existing sites, delineate new protected areas, and establish corridors for ecological connectivity. To assist recovery and recolonization, management could also focus on habitat predicted to be suitable but where carnivores were not tracked.

Most studies report fire regime characteristics (i.e., frequency, seasonality) at site‐composite levels, commonly at ≤1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>spatial resolution. In this study, we analyzed the historical spatial variation of fire regime characteristics over the past four centuries (1620<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">CE</jats:styled-content>to present) in a red pine/oak landscape (30.75 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) in north‐central Pennsylvania,<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">USA</jats:styled-content>. Fire event data were reconstructed based on fire scars and locations of 192 living and dead red pines. The spatial and temporal distributions of fire scars revealed a historical fire regime dominated by frequent, dormant season fires most often detected at relatively small spatial extents and by relatively few trees. There was, however, evidence of less frequent, relatively large fires that scarred high percentages of trees. These fire regime characteristics likely resulted in a spatially and temporally transient patchwork of varying vegetation age and structures resulting in a heterogeneous landscape. At the landscape scale, fire frequency changed with human cultures, while fire spatial extent and scarring patterns appeared to be modulated by drought conditions. Results from this study show historical precedence for landscape‐scale burning across a broad range of drought conditions and spatial extents, which should be considered when designing fire‐management and ecosystem restoration objectives.</jats:p>

TI  - Contrasting Effect of Artificial Grasslands on the Intensity of Deer Browsing and Debarking in Forests
PY  - 2019
AB  - Deer can strongly affect other species as a keystone species. The intensity of their herbivory impact on forest vegetation is suggested to be affected by not only deer density but also by other environmental factors such as landscape components. Especially, artificial grasslands such as pastures and meadows possibility affect deer impact on forest vegetation by altering deer foraging behavior. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the effect of presence/absence of artificial grasslands on impact by sika deer (Cervus nippon) on forest vegetation. We compared the occurrence of debarking and the coverage of understory vegetation in two adjacent regions under similar deer density with and without artificial grasslands in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. The occurrence probability of debarking was more severe in forests in abundant artificial grassland region than in no artificial grasslands region despite considering the effects of deer density, tree size, and tree species. In contrast, the coverage of understory vegetation was high in abundant artificial grassland region than in no artificial grassland region despite considering the effects of light condition, vegetation type, and deer density. In conclusion, artificial grasslands modify deer impact on forest vegetation by increasing the occurrence probability of debarking but decreasing the browsing pressure on understory vegetation.

TI  - Using Diachronic Cartography and GIS to Map Forest Landscape Changes in the Putna-Vrancea Natural Park, Romania
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The Putna-Vrancea Natural Park (PVNP) is one of the wildest mountain areas in Romania and is home to internationally important species of flora and fauna. Although the park’s area is covered by forests, the last two centuries have seen several major transformations. The aim of this article is to present a historical approach to the development of habitat areas within the PVNP, with an attempt to show both the situation before and after the establishment of its protection regime. The changes in the forest area were identified using available cartographic material from 1789, 1895, 1957, 1975, 2005, and 2018. The analysis of forest distribution according to different classes of natural factors (altitude, slope, soil type, and lithology) highlighted the early 20th century when forest cover decreased at low altitudes and slopes. However, anthropogenic factors were responsible for almost all changes. The specific socio-economic system of the Vrancea Mountains, according to which the forest was and still is owned by the inhabitants of several villages, led to periods of deforestation: burning to increase the area of pastures and the unsustainable exploitation of wood by some companies that had been granted this right by the owners. In the 1960s and 1970s, the mountain pastures were reforested, and in the last 20 years, the mountain pastures have been transformed into forests. Although the use of old maps for this type of analysis has certain limitations, the results obtained provide insight into the causes of the transformation of forest landscapes in some areas of the PVNP.</jats:p>

TI  - Wolf visitations close to human residences in Finland: The role of age, residence density, and time of day
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Large carnivorous mammals, such as the gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) have been recently expanding to human-dominated landscapes in many regions. Although wolves tend to avoid human infrastructure, visitations close to human residences might be unavoidable in territories that are highly fragmented by residential areas. House yard visits are of particular concern: according to the Finnish legislation, wolves that repeatedly approach within 150 m from the nearest residential building can legally be killed for human safety. We analyzed the average distance from house yards and probability of house yard visitations by wolves against sex, age class, time of the day, season and house density for 25 territorial GPS-tracked wolves in Finland. Generally, wolves avoid houses — with mean distances higher than from random locations in the territory. This difference became higher with decreasing house density for sub-adults while for adults this difference decreased slightly with decreasing house density. Probability of visitation in house-yards increased with increasing house densities, was far higher at night than in the daytime, a difference that was greater with increasing house density. Sub-adults visited house-yards more often than adult wolves in the first summer after spring dispersal from the natal pack to a territory, but there was no difference in winter. The indication that wolves learn within a season to avoid moving to near residential buildings in human-dominated territories is when the territory becomes more familiar to wolves which is a noteworthy result for the management.

TI  - Long-term effects and cost-benefit analysis of eight spawning gravel augmentations for Atlantic salmon and Brown trout in Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>River regulation alters flow and sediment regime, habitat availability, and ultimately the ecological functioning of rivers. Various restoration and mitigation measures have been developed to improve ecological function, and among them is the addition of gravel to enhance the reproduction of gravel bed spawning fishes. However, information on long-term efficiency, costs, and maintenance needs of gravel additions are scarce. Here, we study the functioning of gravel additions at eight sites in three rivers in western Norway for up to 18 years. Gravel was added between 2002 and 2010 to enhance spawning of Atlantic salmon and anadromous Brown trout. We monitored changes in the size of the gravel-covered areas, sediment composition, interstitial oxygen, egg survival, and juvenile fish densities. Additionally, we report monetary costs, identify potential maintenance needs, and calculate a cost-benefit ratio. Juvenile densities of Atlantic salmon and Brown trout increased significantly after the gravel augmentations. After 10–18 years, the median egg survival was still high (&gt; 90%) and sediment conditions were still suitable for salmonid fish reproduction. The areas were, however, shrinking across time (median area reduction 26%), mostly caused by scouring of gravel in the steep, supply-limited, and partly regulated rivers. The average construction costs of spawning gravel augmentations were 11.2 NOK (1.12 €) m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Compared to similar measures elsewhere, the measures have had a long life span (up to 18 years) at relatively low costs. Gravel augmentation was concluded to be a successful management measure that contributed to significantly increased Atlantic salmon and Brown trout reproduction.</jats:p>

TI  - Space use and habitat selection of the wolf ( Canis lupus ) in human-altered environment in Finland
PY  - 2011
AB  - The grey wolf is the most widely distributed of all land mammals and is a habitat generalist that inhabits all the vegetation types of the Northern Hemisphere. Wolves also breed well and have the potential to rapidly expand to new areas. In Finland, the wolf is a game species, and as a result of Finland’s membership of the European Union, the wolf population is subject to very limited hunting due to the obligation to protect the species. Mainly for this reason, the wolf population in Finland has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, the birth rate has developed favourably and the number of litters increased from just four in 1996 to 20 in 2005. It also seems at present that the wolf population in Finland is no longer following the fluctuations in wolf numbers in Russian Karelia. The general aim of this dissertation is to provide applicable knowledge for wolf management and conservation purposes, and especially to examine the effects of human-modified landscapes on wolf population expansion in Finland. Various aspects of habitat selection were investigated in four sub-studies to gain a thorough insight into the space use and habitat needs of wolves. Species data came from a long-term wolf population study that included location information from 85 radioand GPS-GSM-collared wolves from 1998 onwards, as well as track location data based on about 30 000 annual observations recorded with geographical coordinates by a local network of experts on large carnivores. I found that adaptability makes it possible for the wolf to live in the multiple-use, semi-wild forests of Finland and that no restrictions are imposed by the landscape on wolf population growth and expansion. In general, the results of my dissertation provide evidence that wolves tend to avoid the presence of human influence when establishing a territory and also when selecting their den site. However, as wolf numbers increase, conflict situations will more frequently occur between wolves and humans, although the risk of depredation events, for example among sheep farms, varies between farms in Finland. That is, there are some environmental and farm level factors that are associated with wolf depredation. The breeding wolf population in Finland has gradually expanded and the first litters have recently been born in western Finland after an absence of more than 100 years. The geographical distance to the Scandinavian population is shorter from these new western territories than from the population’s core area in eastern Finland. This could potentially increase the likelihood of dispersal from Finland to Scandinavia.

TI  - Willingness to pay for reintroducing wolves in a divided voting base
PY  - 2023
AB  - Wolves will soon be reintroduced in Colorado based on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed in November 2020. Using an economic choice experiment, we estimate the benefits that wolf introduction might bring to Colorado. We calculated willingness to pay (WTP) for a sustainable wolf population by considering six program attributes: 1) state wolf population, 2) compensation for livestock-related losses, 3) cost-sharing for conflict reduction, 4) number of livestock killed statewide, 5) lethal government control of wolves, and 6) wolf hunting. Respondents who reported they voted yes on the ballot initiative had a positive WTP for a population of 200 wolves, referred to as the minimum sustainable population in the survey, but WTP diminished for larger populations. Preferences for a population of 200 wolves amounts to an annual WTP of approximately $31.1 million when extrapolating to all yes-voting households statewide. In contrast, respondents who reported they voted no would have to be paid to accept wolf populations. We also found statistically significant preferences for other attributes of the management program, such as cost sharing for conflict reduction measures to livestock producers or compensating livestock losses. When these attributes were included, the willingness to pay increased to $115 million statewide among yes-voting households. We estimated a $57.5 to $1 benefit-cost ratio for a sustainable wolf population. However, benefits and costs are not evenly distributed across urban and rural residents, which suggests that mechanisms to transfer resources from those willing to pay to those that incur costs would be needed to balance that distribution.

TI  - Combining multiple data sources in species distribution models while accounting for spatial dependence and overfitting with combined penalised likelihood maximisation
PY  - 2019
AB  - Summary The increase in availability of species data sets means that approaches to species distribution modelling that incorporate multiple data sets are in greater demand. Recent methodological developments in this area have led to combined likelihood approaches, in which a log-likelihood comprised of the sum of the log-likelihood components of each data source is maximised. Often, these approaches make use of at least one presence-only data set and use the log-likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model in the combined likelihood construction. While these advancements have been shown to improve predictive performance, they do not currently address challenges in presence-only modelling such as checking and correcting for violations of the independence assumption of a Poisson point process model or more general challenges in species distribution modelling such as overfitting. In this paper, we present an extension of the combined likelihood framework which accommodates alternative presence-only likelihoods in the presence of spatial dependence as well as lasso-type penalties to account for potential overfitting. We compare the proposed approach combined penalised likelihood approach to the standard combined likelihood approach via simulation and apply the method to modelling the distribution of the Eurasian lynx in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The simulations show that the proposed combined penalised likelihood approach outperforms the standard approach when spatial dependence is present in the data. The lynx analysis shows that the predicted maps vary significantly with the different implementations of the proposed approach. This work highlights the benefits of careful consideration of the presence-only components of the combined likelihood formulation, and allows greater flexibility and ability to accommodate real datasets.

TI  - Spatial variation of surface soil carbon in a boreal forest – the role of historical fires, contemporary vegetation, and hydro-topography
PY  - 2022
AB  - Knowledge about the spatial variation of boreal forest soil carbon (C) stocks is limited, but crucial for establishing management practices that prevent losses of soil C. Here, we quantified the surface soil C stocks across small spatial scales, and aim to contribute to an improved understanding of the drivers involved in boreal forest soil C accumulation. Our study is based on C analyses of 192 soil cores, positioned and recorded systematically within a forest area of 11 ha. The study area is a south-central Norwegian boreal forest landscape, where the fire history for the past 650 years has been reconstructed. Soil C stocks ranged from 1.3 to 96.7 kg m−2 and were related to fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, vegetation attributes, and hydro-topography. Soil C stocks increased with soil nitrogen concentration, soil water content, Sphagnum- and litter-dominated forest floor vegetation, and proportion of silt in the mineral soil, and decreased with fire frequency in site 1, feathermoss- and lichen-dominated forest floor vegetation and increasing slope. Our results emphasize that boreal forest surface soil C stocks are highly variable in size across fine spatial scales, shaped by an interplay between historical forest fires, ecosystem productivity, forest floor vegetation, and hydro-topography.

TI  - Drifting space use of common cranes—Is there a mismatch between daytime behaviour and management?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Many populations of large grazing birds (cranes, geese, swans) have recovered following protection. During migration, these birds often aggregate in large numbers at staging sites and feed on agricultural crops. Because staging sites often coincide with protected wetlands, extensive crop damages may avert both bird and wetland conservation. There is a need to integrate damage mitigation and conservation of large grazing birds staging in agricultural landscapes, based on knowledge of large grazing birds’ spacing behavior. Their space use forms the basis for assessment of damage risk and for the scale at which measures should be implemented. We used high-resolution GPS location data to assess space use of common cranes (Grus grus) at an important staging site in south-central Sweden. We focus on daytime behaviour because this is the time when foraging cranes may cause crop damage and when preventive measures such as scaring and culling are conducted. We found that the daily activity area (mean 4.4 km 2 ) did not vary within staging periods. Cranes exhibited high site fidelity during staging, as their activity area over the staging period (mean 15.6 km 2 ) was considerably smaller than the entire staging site (>200 km 2 ). However, on a daily scale cranes gradually shifted activity areas, forming a space use pattern analogous to overlapping rings. This pattern is presumably explained by heterogeneous and unpredictable food availability caused by continuous changes in agricultural practices, weather conditions and competition. Considering the size of crane activity areas over the staging period and the scale of current damage preventive measures ( e.g., hunting permissions given for a few fields [mean size 0.049 km 2 ] at a time), we suggest that current preventive measures might be implemented on a too small scale compared to that of crane space use. Our findings highlight the necessity of adapting crop damage preventive measures to the scale of bird space use to facilitate both bird conservation and agricultural practices at wetlands staging sites along the flyways.

TI  - Public authorities for transformative change: integration principle in public funding.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Although science widely supports moving towards transformative change through integrating biodiversity into decision-making, and arguing for the essential role of public authorities, it falls short on suggesting specific means to that end. This article considers the EU's approach to fostering the green transition as part of its post-pandemic recovery while exploring how the integration of biodiversity considerations could be integrated into decision-making. The rationale and implementation of the EU's <i>do no harm</i> principle is examined, which functioned as a condition for public funds. The analysis shows the mentioned EU policy innovation has a very limited impact. The role of <i>do no harm</i> has been limited to validating, rather than initiating policy measures. It has failed to influence the design of measures such that they would benefit biodiversity and not encouraged synergies between the climate and biodiversity goals. Based on the experience with <i>do no harm</i> as well as the more focussed regulatory action directed at the goal of climate neutrality, the article lists key steps for fostering biodiversity integration in policy planning and policy implementation. These steps encompass substantive and procedural approaches and aim for deliberation, target-setting, tracking, verification and screening. There is considerable scope for robust regulation to play a role in support of the biodiversity goals alongside transformative bottom-up initiatives.

TI  - Ecological legacies of anthropogenic burning in a British Columbia coastal temperate rain forest
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aim Few long-term fire histories have been reconstructed in coastal temperate rain forests, and little is known regarding the spatial and temporal characteristics of lightning and human ignitions. We use a multidisciplinary approach to assess the impact, scale and ecological legacies of historic fires. Location We focus on perhumid temperate rain forests located on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. Methods We reconstructed 700 years of temporal and spatial aspects of fire activity with 30 plots on Hecate Island using fire scars and forest-stand establishment. We then conducted a paired study of 20 former indigenous habitation and control sites on 15 islands to relate fire activity to patterns of human settlement. We mapped 15 years of lightning strike densities and use mixed-effects modelling to assess whether fire activity predicted the distribution and abundance of traditional plants. Results Sixteen low- and mixed-severity fires were recorded from 1376 to 1893. The abundance of traditional plants and the density of western redcedar trees were best predicted by the location of former habitation sites and shorter mean fire intervals. Lightning is too rare to explain the pattern of fire activity in the study area. No fire activity was detected after 1893, coinciding with the relocation of indigenous groups from the study area. Main conclusions Fire was strongly associated with former indigenous habitation sites during the periods of occupation. People likely utilized fire as a tool for resource management to influence the densities of specific plants by creating mosaics of vegetation in different stages of succession. By assessing the ecological impacts of historic fire events, we gain a better understanding of the abrupt changes that occurred in the 20th century. Our ability to understand present-day temperate rain forest ecosystems may be compromised if we underestimate the role of humans in driving historic fire activity.

TI  - Quantifying net water consumption of Norwegian hydropower reservoirs and related aquatic biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Compared to conventional energy technologies, hydropower has the lowest carbon emissions per kWh. Therefore, hydropower electricity production can contribute to combat climate change challenges. However, hydropower electricity production may at the same time contribute to environmental impacts and has been characterized as a large water consumer with impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Life Cycle Assessment is not yet able to assess the biodiversity impact of water consumption from hydropower electricity production on a global scale. The first step to assess these biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment is to quantify the water consumption per kWh energy produced. We calculated catchment-specific net water consumption values for Norway ranging between 0 and 0.012 m3/kWh. Further, we developed the first characterization factors for quantifying the aquatic biodiversity impacts of water consumption in a post-glaciated region. We apply our approach to quantify the biodiversity impact per kWh Norwegian hydropower electricity. Our results vary over six orders of magnitude and highlight the importance of a spatial explicit approach. This study contributes to assessing the biodiversity impacts of water consumption globally in Life Cycle Assessment.

TI  - Meeting at the crossroads
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>As global environmental changes continue to accelerate, research and practice in the field of conservation biology may be essential to help forestall precipitous declines in the earth’s ability to sustain a diversity of life. However, many conservation programs have faced scrutiny for the social injustices they create, especially within the paradigm of demarcating protected lands. Currently, a new conservation paradigm emphasizing landscapes shared by people and wildlife is emerging, and with it, an opportunity to ensure that justice for both human and beyond-human groups is given consideration. Here, we examine a practice emblematic of this new conservation paradigm, the reintroduction and recovery of large carnivore species, and draw from theories in environmental justice to detail the many forms of justice at stake in these efforts. Our analysis shows that a pluralistic application of justice is required to ensure that new conservation practices do not produce and reproduce injustices for people. In addition, we show that the success of these emerging programs in meeting their conservation goals in fact depends on meaningfully addressing a range of justice concerns. By developing this framework, we also identify domains in which environmental justice scholarship can expand its scope. To this end, we introduce the novel concept of affective environmental justice, which describes the complex role of emotions as environmental harms, as disruptors of understanding other forms of justice, and as links between logics of oppression. Our framework offers a comprehensive resource to work through in planning and implementing large carnivore reintroduction and recovery programs, and we conclude by describing the challenges and opportunities for further aligning conservation and environmental justice in research and practice.</jats:p>

TI  - Opportunities, challenges and the way ahead for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) by the hydrocarbon industry: Towards a sustainable future
PY  - 2022
AB  - While carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has garnered many headlines in the recent past, its wider applicability on an industrial scale is yet to be explored due to a plethora of industrial challenges, primarily involving the short-term financial attractiveness of CCS projects. However, CCS represents a crucial technology for the hydrocarbon industry to extend its utility and financial attractiveness in this age where environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria applied by financial institutes restrict access to capital by the hydrocarbon industry. However, CCS opportunities in the hydrocarbon industry are varied and require a more detailed understanding of the various processes for them to be successful in their desired operational parameters. Alternatively, the captured carbon dioxide (CO2) may be utilized for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or methane production, which is referred to as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Hence, the primary purpose of this review is to introduce the wider research audience to the various process of CCUS in the hydrocarbon industry by providing a brief introduction to their various process and their carbon storage potential. The review article discusses multiple CCS technologies and studies the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) values of each of these technologies in order to give a better outlook about the CCS technologies being employed in the contemporary world. Also, the viability of each CCUS process in subsurface oil mobilization applications would be explored for adverse conditions. Finally, a brief highlight on the implementation of proposed CCUS methods and their transition towards CO2 storage gas has been elaborated upon. Apart from reviewing the literature related to CCUS technologies, the authors have elaborated upon the economic aspects of these technologies. There authors have also studied the economic impact of carbon capture in different industries like the chemical industry, cement industry, etc. and thus, the review paper is intended to act as a guide for policy makers about the intended future course of action with regards to reducing the carbon footprint of the oil, till better and more equitable sources of energy replace it.

TI  - Trends and patterns in annually burned forest areas and fire weather across the European boreal zone in the 20th and early 21st centuries
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Fire remains one of the main natural disturbance factors in the European boreal zone and understanding climatic forcing on fire activity is important for projecting effects of climate change on ecosystem services in this region. We analyzed records of annually burned areas in 16 administrative regions of the European boreal zone (countries or administrative units within countries) and fire weather variability to test for their spatio-temporal patterns over the 1901-2017 period. Over the 1992-2017 period, the region exhibited large variability in forest fire activity with the fire cycles varying from ~1600 (St. Petersburg region) to ~37000 years (Finland). The clustering of administrative units in respect to their burned area, suggested the presence of sub-regions with synchronous annual variability in burned areas. Large fire years (LFYs) in each of the clusters were associated with the development of the high pressure cell over or in immediate proximity of the regions in question in July, indicating climatic forcing of LFYs. Contingency analysis indicated that there was no long-term trend in the synchrony of LFYs observed simultaneously in several administrative units. We documented a trend towards higher values of Monthly Drought Code (MDC) for the months of April and May in the western (April) and northern (April and May) sections. The significant positive correlation between biome-wide fire activity index and June SNAO (Summer North Atlantic Oscillation) (r = 0.53) pointed to the importance of large-scale atmospheric circulation, in particular the summer European blocking pattern, in controlling forest fires across EBZ. The forest fire activity of the European boreal zone remains strongly connected to the annual climate variability. Higher frequency of strongly positive SNAO states in the future will likely synchronize years with a large area burned across the European boreal zone.

TI  - Coexistence Praxis: The Role of Resource Managers in Wolf-Livestock Interactions on Federal Lands
PY  - 2021
AB  - In resource management, new terms are frequently introduced, reflecting ongoing evolution in the theory and practice of ecology and governance. Yet understandings of what new concepts mean, for whom, and what they imply for management on the ground can vary widely. Coexistence – a prominent concept within the literature and on-the-ground practices around human-wildlife conflict and predator management – is one such term, widely invoked and yet poorly defined. While for some coexistence is the latest paradigm in improving human-wildlife relations, the concept remains debated and indeed even hotly contested by others – particularly on the multiple-use public lands of the American West, where gray wolf conservation, livestock production, and the claims of diverse stakeholders share space. The multiple meanings of coexistence present serious challenges for conservation practice, as what the concept implies or requires can be contested by those most central to its implementation. In this study we examine wolf-livestock management – a classic case of human-wildlife conflict – by focusing on the experiences and perspectives of U.S. Forest Service managers. We conducted a genealogical review exploring coexistence’s multivalence in the literature on human-wildlife conflict, complementing semi-structured interviews conducted with USFS range and wildlife managers on case study forests from across the western states. Through this, we highlight the complexity and multi-dimensionality of the concept and the unique yet under-explored perspective that resource managers bring to these debates. This work draws on insights from political ecology to emphasize the situatedness of manager practice – taking place within a broader set of relations and contextual pressures – while extending political ecologists’ traditional focus on the resource user to a concern with the resource manager as key actor in environmental conflicts. Through our engagement with the experiences and perceptions of USFS managers, who must balance conservation aims with long-established land uses like livestock grazing, we hope to clarify the various dimensions of coexistence and in so doing increase the possibility for collaboration and empathy among managers and stakeholders engaged in this complex socio-ecological challenge.

TI  - Eurasian lynx fitness shows little variation across Scandinavian human-dominated landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Despite extensive research on the ecology and behavioural adaptations of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes, information about the fitness consequences of sharing landscapes is still limited. We assessed the variation in three consecutive components of female fitness: the probability of reproduction, litter size and juvenile survival in relation to environmental and human factors in a solitary carnivore, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), occurring in human-dominated landscapes in Scandinavia. We used demographic data from 57 radio-collared adult females between 1995–2011 (126 radio-years). Overall, the yearly probability of female reproduction was 0.80, mean litter size was 2.34 (range 1–4) and the probability to find a female that reproduced in the spring being accompanied by at least one offspring during the subsequent winter was 0.70. We did not find evidence that food availability was a key factor influencing female fitness. Female lynx may adapt to food availability when establishing their home ranges by adopting an obstinate strategy, ensuring a minimum amount of prey necessary for survival and reproduction even during periods of prey scarcity. In human-dominated landscapes, where sufficient prey are available for lynx, mortality risk may have a larger influence on lynx population dynamics compared to food availability. Our results suggest that lynx population dynamics in human-dominated landscapes may be mainly driven by human impacts on survival.

TI  - The major threats to Atlantic salmon in Norway
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an economically and culturally important species. Norway has more than 400 watercourses with Atlantic salmon and supports a large proportion of the world’s wild Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon are structured into numerous genetically differentiated populations, and are therefore managed at the population level. Long-distance migrations between freshwater and ocean habitats expose Atlantic salmon to multiple threats, and a number of anthropogenic factors have contributed to the decline of Atlantic salmon during the last decades. Knowledge on the relative importance of the different anthropogenic factors is vital for prioritizing management measures. We developed a semi-quantitative 2D classification system to rank the different anthropogenic factors and used this to assess the major threats to Norwegian Atlantic salmon. Escaped farmed salmon and salmon lice from fish farms were identified as expanding population threats, with escaped farmed salmon being the largest current threat. These two factors affect populations to the extent that they may be critically endangered or lost, with a large likelihood of causing further reductions and losses in the future. The introduced parasite Gyrodactylus salaris, freshwater acidification, hydropower regulation and other habitat alterations were identified as stabilized population threats, which have contributed to populations becoming critically endangered or lost, but with a low likelihood of causing further loss. Other impacts were identified as less influential, either as stabilized or expanding factors that cause loss in terms of number of returning adults, but not to the extent that populations become threatened. Management based on population specific reference points (conservation limits) has reduced exploitation in Norway, and overexploitation was therefore no longer regarded an important impact factor. The classification system may be used as a template for ranking of anthropogenic impact factors in other countries and as a support for national and international conservation efforts.</jats:p>

TI  - Canopy openness and exclusion of wild ungulates act synergistically to improve oak natural regeneration
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The recruitment of forest trees is driven by both bottom-up processes (the acquisition of resources) and top-down processes (herbivory). To initiate stand regeneration, foresters commonly reduce tree density to increase light levels for seedlings and enhance primary productivity. These changes in vegetation dynamics, however, could also influence effects of ungulate browsing, resulting in unintended consequences for forest management. Here, we assessed how effects of ungulate exclusion and canopy opening interacted to affect the regeneration of two oak species: Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. We monitored the growth and survival of oak seedlings for two to three growth seasons in paired fenced and unfenced plots under contrasting conditions of canopy openness (8% to 52%) at five sites in southern Sweden and three sites in northeastern France. We scored browsing in the unfenced plots by the four cervids occurring in these areas (Alces alces, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Dama dama). Fencing increased the growth of (mostly taller) seedlings occurring in Sweden and the survival of (mostly smaller) seedlings in France. Both effects increased as canopies became more open. Browsing reduced oak seedling growth in both countries, independently of canopy openness. Canopy openness increased browsing levels in Sweden. Cervid densities did not appear to modify how fencing affected oak seedling growth and survival. In both contrasting forest environments, creating gaps tended to enhance ungulate damage on young forest stands as browsing frequency increased. We conclude that net forest regeneration reflects a subtle equilibrium between enhancing resource availability, boosting seedling growth, and limiting herbivory, which curtails seedling growth and survival.

TI  - Stakeholder involvement in adaptive goose management; case studies and experiences from Norway
PY  - 2013
AB  - Two Svalbard-breeding goose populations, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus and the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis, have, over the last decades, increased in numbers and expanded in distribution. At spring- staging sites in Norway, conflicts with agriculture are significant as the geese feed on cultivated fields, with negative consequences for the farmers. In the present paper we give an overview of relevant stakeholders in these goose- agriculture conflicts and share some of our experiences when involving stakeholders and users in a dynamic and adaptive process. The paper demonstrates how researchers can engage in the management process at different levels, in order to facilitate a process towards an adaptive co-management in an environment of conflicting interests. The framework described may be used for threatened bird species and situations where there are conflicts between wildlife stakeholders such as management agencies, conservation interests, hunting and agriculture.

AB  - In this chapter, Martin Drenthen discusses debates about the possible return of the wolf to parts of Europe where they were absent for over 150 years. He argues that the return of wolves challenges perceived notions, not only about what nature is, but also about human’s place within nature. Drenthen discusses various perspectives towards the newly arriving wolves, that all imply not just an image of what a wolf actually is, but also a view about the landscape and human’s proper place in it. He finds that all parties appear to have difficulty emplacing the wolf. Wolves challenge the idea of many wolf opponents that wolves are essentially inhabitants of the wild that intrude human land. Returning wolves do not care about a neat division between cultural landscapes and wild land, and in doing so undermine the very foundation of a worldview in which the domestication of nature is seen as essential for being human. The world view of many wolf lovers is equally challenged by wolves, however. Many regard wolves as victims of modern society and the human desire to subdue nature, but deem possible a relationship of peaceful coexistence with wolves as long as humans can control their aggression towards the natural world. The resurgence of the wolves, however, forces us to reconsider what it means to be part of an ecological network in which predators exist as well, and reveals that a particular kind of love for wolves can only exist in abstractum. Finally, the return of the wolf also challenges the dominant approach of nature managers and professional wolf experts who, in an effort to ease societal tensions surrounding the resurgence of the wolf, take the wolf as an essentially normal animal that can be managed rationally. But in doing so, wolf managers display an obsession with order in nature that contrasts with the very meaning that the wolf as a wild animal seems to have.

TI  - Controlling biodiversity impacts of future global hydropower reservoirs by strategic site selection
PY  - 2020
AB  - Further reservoir-based hydropower development can contribute to the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) on affordable and clean energy, and climate action. However, hydropower reservoir operation can lead to biodiversity impacts, thus interfering with the SDGs on clean water and life on land. We combine a high-resolution, location-specific, technical assessment with newly developed life cycle impact assessment models, to assess potential biodiversity impacts of possible future hydropower reservoirs, resulting from land occupation, water consumption and methane emissions. We show that careful selection of hydropower reservoirs has a large potential to limit biodiversity impacts, as for example, 0.3% of the global hydropower potential accounts for 25% of the terrestrial biodiversity impact. Local variations, e.g. species richness, are the dominant explanatory factors of the variance in the quantified biodiversity impact and not the mere amount of water consumed, or land occupied per kWh. The biodiversity impacts are mainly caused by land occupation and water consumption, with methane emissions being much less important. Further, we indicate a trade-off risk between terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity impacts, as due to the weak correlation between terrestrial and aquatic impacts, reservoirs with small aquatic biodiversity impacts tend to have larger terrestrial impacts and vice versa.

TI  - The challenges and opportunities of coexisting with wild ungulates in the human-dominated landscapes of Europe’s Anthropocene
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The cumulative impact of human activities has driven many species into severe declines across the globe. However, the recent focus on conservation optimism has begun to highlight case studies that go against this trend. Reforestation, agricultural abandonment, reintroduction and legislative change have led to a situation where large mammals have recovered and are now widespread across the European continent. This study summarizes the knowledge about wild ungulate distribution in Europe and review the diversity of ways in which they interact with humans. Drawn from a wide range of sources, we built distribution maps of European wild ungulates. Results show that 90% of Europe is home to at least 1 species of wild native ungulate, with roe deer and wild boar occupying 74% and 64% of Europe respectively. In contrast, wild native mountain ungulates only occupy 5% of Europe, and are often associated with protected areas. The wide distribution of most European ungulates combined with the extensive human activity within Europe result in a wide range of interactions between ungulates and humans. These interactions can be classified as services or disservices depending on the value orientation and economic position of the various stakeholders perceiving this relationship. Overall, our survey highlights the success of wildlife management policies in Europe and the potential for continental scale conservation of large mammals in human-dominated landscapes. However, maintaining the success of wild ungulate conservation requires actions from national and European institutions to improve coordinated management across jurisdictional borders and sectorial coordination for the whole landscape.

TI  - Locating Human-Wildlife Interactions: Landscape Constructions and Responses to Large Carnivore Conservation in India and Norway
PY  - 2015
AB  - People's reactions to large carnivores take many forms, ranging from support and coexistence to resistance and conflict. While these reactions are the outcome of many different factors, in this paper we specifically explore the link between social constructions of landscapes and divergent responses to large carnivore presence. We compare case studies from four different landscapes shared by people and large carnivores, in India and Norway. We use social construction of landscapes as a key concept to explore responses to large carnivores in the context of ecological, economic, social, and cultural changes in these areas. Based on this comparison, we argue that the process of change is complex, with a plurality of responses from the groups affected by it. The response to large carnivore presence is influenced by many different factors, of which the interpretation of change-particularly landscape change-plays a significant role.

TI  - APPLYING MULTILEVEL LONGITUDINAL MODELS TO PLANT DEMOGRAPHIC PROCESSES: NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES AND OVERABUNDANT HERBIVORES
PY  - 2015
AB  - Long-term, multi-factor studies are necessary to understand the population-level impacts and relative importance of species interactions. Such experiments produce data that are rich in detail but challenging to analyse. In my dissertation I have investigated the population-level impacts of two interactions, allelopathy and herbivory, by applying longitudinal statistical models to long-term experimental data. These data were collected during a decade-long investigation of impacts of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and an allelopathic invader (Alliaria petiolata) on forest herbs and trees. There is great concern about the impacts of overabundant deer, but little is known about how quickly forests respond when deer abundance is reduced. Using biennial survey data I modeled changes in sapling abundance after deer exclusion. I found that Acer saccharum (sugar maple) but not other species exhibited signs of recovery in <7 years, but changes were obscured by density declines near the end of the study, likely due to self-thinning. Using meta-analysis I determined that other studies observed desired changes typically after ~20 years. Few, however, carry out frequent surveys and therefore likely miss important processes such as thinning. Invasive plants are also widely considered to be an ecological problem. Small-scale experiments have established that allelopathic invaders can negatively impact plant fitness. To determine if an allelopathic plant has population-level effects, I modeled the impacts of Alliaria removal on the herb Maianthemum racemosum. While Alliaria removal benefits Maianthemum vital rates, changes take >5 years to appear. Broadening the analysis to compare the effects of deer and Alliaria on two additional herbs, I found that Alliaria impacts multiples species and vital rates, and that at times its effects can be as detrimental as deer browse. Combining the power of experiments with sophisticated statistics, I have shown that plant-plant and plant-animal interactions can be similar in magnitude. Without longitudinal data and appropriate models, we would not have been able to characterize the effects of deer on saplings, or Alliaria on understory herbs, instead concluding that deer exclusion was not impacting forest regeneration and Alliaria removal not improving plant vital rates.

TI  - Marginal imprint of human land use upon fire history in a mire-dominated boreal landscape of the Veps Highland, North-West Russia
PY  - 2022
AB  - Dendrochronological reconstructions inform us about historical climate-fire-human interactions, providing a means to calibrate projections of future fire hazard. Most of these reconstructions, however, have been developed in landscapes with a considerable proportion of xeric sites that could potentially inflate our estimates of the historic levels of fire activity. We provide a 420-year long reconstruction of fires in a mire-dominated landscape of the Veps Nature Park, North-West Russia. The area has mostly escaped large-scale forestry operations in the past and is an example of pristine mid-boreal vegetation with a high (approximately 30% for the area studied) proportion of waterlogged areas with ombrotropic mires. The historical fire cycle was 91.4 years (90% confidence intervals, CI 66.2–137.6 years) over the 1580–1720 period, decreasing to 35.9 (CI 28.1–47.6 years) between 1730 and 1770, and then increasing again to 122.7 years (CI 91.0–178.0 years) over the 1780–2000 period. Early season fires dominated over late season fires during the reconstruction period. We documented a higher fire activity period between 1730 and 1780, resulting from the increase in early season fires. This period coincided with one of the largest multi-decadal declines in the reconstructed spring precipitation since 1600 CE, although we found no significant relationship between fire and precipitation over the whole reconstructed period. The nine largest fire years were associated with negative summer precipitation and positive summer temperature anomalies over the study region. Land-use history of the area did not appear to have an effect on historical fire dynamics. Modern (1996–2016) fire records indicate a regional fire cycle of ∼ 1300 years, featuring a pronounced pattern with early (April–May) and late (July–September) season fires. The uniform fire cycle in the area since 1780, occurrence of nine largest fire years during years with spring-summer droughts, and low ignition frequencies over the last 420 years (0.005 to 0.037 ignitions per year and km2) suggest that the fire regime of the Veps Highland remained largely natural until the onset of the 20th century.

TI  - Synthesis of habitat restoration impacts on young-of-the-year salmonids in boreal rivers
PY  - 2019
AB  - River restoration offers the potential to enhance biological integrity, often measured as fish population changes. We used a meta-analytical approach to synthesize density responses to in-stream habitat restoration by young-of-the year (YOY) brown trout and Atlantic salmon in 28 rivers (overall 32 restoration projects) in Finland. We also examined which local and watershed-scale factors most influenced restoration success. Finally, we conducted an expert survey to obtain an independent estimate of a sufficient density enhancement for restoration to be considered successful. Despite strong context-dependency, habitat restoration had an overall positive effect on YOY salmonid density. When compared to target levels derived from the expert survey, density responses mainly reached the minimum expected success rate, but remained short of the level considered to reflect distinct success. Variability in restoration responses of trout was linked mainly to river size, predominant geology, water quality and potential interspecific competition (trout vs. European bullhead). Fishing mortality tended to obscure positive effects of restoration and stocking by YOY fish affected negatively trout’s response to restoration, supporting a shift towards self-sustainable schemes in fisheries management. These results imply that habitat restoration is a useful approach for improving the ecological and conservational status of salmonid populations in boreal rivers. To further improve the success rate, and thereby public acceptance, of restorations they need to be complemented by other management measures that enhance the potential for the recovery of threatened salmonid populations.

TI  - Natural Disturbances from the Perspective of Forest Ecosystem-Based Management
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Natural disturbances drive forest dynamics and biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales. Forests in the boreal biome are shaped by several types of disturbance, including fire, windthrow, and insect outbreaks, that vary in frequency, extent, severity, and specificity. In managed forests, disturbances also affect the amount and quality of available timber. Ecosystem management uses information on disturbance regimes as a guide to finding a balance between ecological, economic, and social viewpoints. In this chapter, we review current knowledge on disturbance regimes in boreal forests and discuss some implications for managing the impact and risk of disturbances in the context of forest ecosystem management and restoration.</jats:p>

TI  - Are large-scale dams environmentally detrimental? Life-cycle environmental consequences of mega-hydropower plants in Myanmar
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rivers control biophysical processes that underpin essential ecosystem services. Myanmar’s rivers provide great opportunities for increasing energy supply at low costs from hydropower plants and make important contributions to the national economy. However, associated environmental impacts, as well as input and output flows of hydropower developments, remain less well understood. In this paper, we report on an investigation of the overall environmental effects of five hydropower plants in Myanmar, using a life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) approach. The primary objective of the paper is to generate detailed life-cycle inventory data and quantify the environmental impacts of the existing five hydropower plants in Myanmar. This paper reports on a “cradle to grave” LCIA for five hydropower plants in which environmental impacts associated with construction, operation and maintenance, transportation, and decommissioning of large-scale hydropower plants in Myanmar were systematically assessed. Construction, transportation, operation and maintenance phases are most sensitive to global warming, mineral resource depletion, acidification, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity and photochemical ozone creation. There is heterogeneity in hydropower plants’ effects on the environment, based on the size of the power plant. Strategic selection of hydropower projects is suggested to enhance resilience in environmentally sensitive areas. It is concluded that more comprehensive and rigorous environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) is needed, not only for mega-dams but also for the smaller-scale hydropower plants.

TI  - Is it worthwhile scaring geese to alleviate damage to crops? – An experimental study
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary 1. Increasing population sizes of geese are the cause of numerous agricultural conflicts in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Scaring is often used as a tool to chase geese away from fields, either as a means to protect vulnerable crops or as part of goose management schemes to drive geese to accommodation areas. Geese are quick to habituate to stationary scaring devices; hence, active scaring by humans is often employed. However, it remains undocumented how much effort is required for active scaring to be effective. 2. We explored the relationship between intensity of active human scaring on field use and behaviour by geese. Using an experimental framework, we applied four different scaring doses per day (geese were scared either 2, 5, 7 or 10 times per day), to random pastures in a pinkfooted goose spring staging area in mid-Norway, and recorded goose flock sizes, fleeing response distances, and average weekly goose densities assessed by dropping densities. In addition, we counted droppings in fields without scaring. We used mixed models to test for changes in the effects of different scaring doses over time and compared observed with predicted dropping levels. 3. Cumulative dropping densities increased at different rates depending on the scaring dose. Scaring dosage did not affect flock size and fleeing response distance during the study period, but both flock sizes and fleeing response distances changed with time. 4. Scaring dose 2 did not show any decrease in relative goose use compared to the fields without scaring, whereas doses 5, 7 and 10 all showed 74–78% fewer droppings by the end of the spring staging period, indicating a possible threshold between dose 2 and 5. The largest effect of scaring appeared during the first week of scaring. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study is the first to show a dose–response relationship between active scaring and field use of flocking geese. For individual farmers, the study provides guidance on the level of scaring effort needed to be cost-effective. If implemented as part of a management scheme with subsidy/accommodation areas in combination with systematic and persistent scaring, it can be used as a tool to keep geese away from areas where they are not wanted, thereby assisting in the alleviation of goose–agriculture conflicts. The approach in this study can be adapted and used in a wider range of wildlife interactions with human economic interests.

TI  - Evaluating the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal potential of improved forest management and accelerated forest conversion in Norway
PY  - 2020
AB  - As a carbon dioxide removal measure, the Norwegian government is currently considering a policy of large-scale planting of spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst) on lands in various states of natural transition to a forest dominated by deciduous broadleaved tree species. Given the aspiration to bring emissions on balance with removals in the latter half of the 21st century in effort to limit the global mean temperature rise to "well below" 2°C, the effectiveness of such a policy is unclear given relatively low spruce growth rates in the region. Further convoluting the picture is the magnitude and relevance of surface albedo changes linked to such projects, which typically counteract the benefits of an enhanced forest CO2 sink in high-latitude regions. Here, we carry out a rigorous empirically based assessment of the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) potential of large-scale spruce planting in Norway, taking into account transient developments in both terrestrial carbon sinks and surface albedo over the 21st century and beyond. We find that surface albedo changes would likely play a negligible role in counteracting tCDR, yet given low forest growth rates in the region, notable tCDR benefits from such projects would not be realized until the second half of the 21st century, with maximum benefits occurring even later around 2150. We estimate Norway's total accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 and 2150 (including surface albedo changes) to be 447 (±240) and 852 (±295) Mt CO2 -eq. at mean net present values of US$ 12 (±3) and US$ 13 (±2) per ton CDR, respectively. For perspective, the accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 represents around 8 years of Norway's total current annual production-based (i.e., territorial) CO2 -eq. emissions.

TI  - Franziscean Cadastre in Landscape Structure Research: A Systematic Review
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Historical and archival sources are of cardinal importance in landscape research addressing the processes and course of landscape changes in European regions. The Franziscean cadastre from the 19<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> century is among the most widely used historical sources in Central Europe. We identified 1440 records, finally providing 104 articles reporting the use of the Franziscean cadastre for in-depth analyses in order to identify (i) the practice of the cadastral data processing, (ii) purpose and spatial extent of the study, (iii) use of complementary sources and (iv) particular land use/land cover classes under study. We have found the increasing attention towards the Franziscean cadastre as a source for landscape research reflected by the doubling number of records in the past decade with majority of the case studies located in Czechia (79), followed by Austria (9) and Italy (3). We have identified the trends in the use in landscape trajectory research and application to hydrology, agriculture and forestry. As regards the data processing, several issues connected with the methodology or design of the records were found (e.g. geographic information system processing description and data source specification). We further problematize the suitability of the supplementary data used and conclude our review with a set of recommendations to contribute to the discussion on the methodology of landscape reconstruction with historical datasets.</jats:p>

TI  - Rocks rock: the importance of rock formations as resting sites of the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx
PY  - 2019
AB  - Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L. are recolonizing parts of their former range in Europe. Not only are lynx strictly protected as a species, but also their habitat and in particular their resting sites are protected. As the known characteristics of lynx resting sites are restricted to vegetation structure, it is difficult to take resting sites into account in planning processes. Here, we show the importance of rock formations for potential resting sites selection and analyzed the frequencies at which GPS-collared lynx returned to potential resting sites in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany. Lynx showed a strong selection for proximity of rocks for resting site selection, and the distance of potential resting sites to rocks was an important predictor for determining whether lynx return to the resting site or not. Furthermore, the frequency of returns to the resting site was positively influenced by the distance to roads and geomorphology. Our findings highlight the importance of rock formations as resting sites for lynx, which can help with the implementation of concrete protection measures.

TI  - Watershed Management for Micro Hydropower Plant Sustainability: Malabar, Indonesia
PY  - 2020
AB  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the watershed management system for the sustainability of hydropower plants. The two main parameters needed to produce electrical energy are water flow and head. Water flow depends on the watershed area, rainfall, and land cover, which affects the runoff and infiltration volume. Good land cover has a large infiltration volume so that it can infiltrate rainwater into the ground and become the reserved water to maintain base flow during the dry season. Malabar Micro Hydropower Plant (MHP), Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, was selected as the case study. There are no significant land-use changes in this area resulting in a stable base flow, which allows MHP to work well until now. The base flow can be continuously maintained at a value not less than 3 $m^{3}/s$, the same as the designed discharge of the power plant. The land-use changes are possible as long as the flow is not lower than the minimum base flow. It can be employed by using a high infiltration coefficient of land cover and artificial recharge groundwater techniques..

TI  - High-resolution mapping of land use changes in Norwegian hydropower systems
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Transition towards sustainable energy systems requires phasing out fossil fuels. Hydropower is a key source of renewable energy and can contribute to reaching a 100 % low carbon-based energy system. Uncertainty remains about land cover changes due to hydropower deployment with a widespread perception of major losses in the land from inundation and associated habitat loss in the surrounding areas due to improved access and recreational use. Norway has a dominant share of hydropower generation in Europe with knowledge gaps in the associated land cover changes. We conducted one of the first retrospective analyses of land use change associated with hydropower development in Norway during the last 80 years. Using remote sensing data, we performed object-based analysis on sets of aerial images representing land systems before and after hydropower construction. We quantified the change in the land due to development of 40 hydropower schemes representing 24 % of the total Norwegian installed capacity. Our analysis revealed that 88 % of analyzed reservoirs were developed by regulating or expanding natural lakes. Vegetation growth was observed in the surrounding regions of 22 of 40 schemes, while urbanization was limited to only 0.9 % of the total surrounding area, primarily located within 400 m from reservoir's borders. Our findings provide insights into interaction between land use change and hydropower development in Norway. Our work provides a basis for further assessment of relevant environmental impacts and can be used to quantify expected land changes due to an increase in Norway's hydropower with integration into the European energy market.

TI  - Effect of agri-environment measure for the aquatic warbler on bird biodiversity in the extensively managed landscape of Biebrza Marshes (Poland)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Farming intensification is one of the main factors responsible for bird populations declining in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, many countries implement agri-environment schemes (AES) to protect farmland biodiversity. However, recent studies showed that the effectiveness of AES varies between positive and negative. In this study we evaluated the effect an agri-environment measure, designed for aquatic warblers (AWM), has on bird biodiversity in a marginal, extensively managed landscape under strong succession pressure. We applied a point-count method to survey birds in areas within the AWM and outside the AWM and described habitat characteristics around these points. We found that AWM areas had a positive effect on the occurrence of aquatic warblers and six other bird species, meadow and Polish AES bird species richness; negatively affected the occurrence of three bird species and the all bird species richness, and was neutral for the occurrence of another ten bird species and for farmland bird species richness. We also show the diverse and sometimes mutually exclusive habitat preferences of the various species. The AWM implemented in extensively managed landscape successfully encouraged farmers to conduct extensive mowing of meadows and so stopped the habitat succession process. Simultaneously, if AWM is considered on a micro scale, it strongly supported some species but also eliminated others. Therefore, we suggest that management plans should be created at a landscape level. Such approach enables the determination of areas in which different species or groups of species are prioritised before others, allowing for the conservation of overall biodiversity.

TI  - Home range sizes of red deer in relation to habitat composition: a review and implications for management in Sweden
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Knowledge about deer spatial use is essential for damage mitigation, conservation, and harvest management. We assess annual and seasonal home range sizes in relation to habitat composition for red deer (<jats:italic>Cervus elaphus</jats:italic>) in Sweden, using GPS-data from two regions with different management systems. We compare our findings with reviewed data on red deer home range sizes in Europe. Annual and seasonal home ranges during calving, hunt, and winter-spring, decreased with increasing proportion forest. Female annual home ranges in a mixed agricultural-forest landscape were three times larger than in a forest-dominated landscape. Core areas (50% Kernels) were approximately 1/5 of the full annual and seasonal home ranges (95% Kernels) regardless of habitat composition. Home range size in the forest-dominated landscape showed little inter-seasonal variation. In the agricultural-forest landscape, home ranges were larger during calving, hunt, and winter-spring compared to summer and rut. In the forest-dominated landscape, management areas are large enough to cover female spatial use. In the agricultural-forest landscape, female spatial use covers several license units. Here, the coordinated license system is needed to reach trade-offs between goals of conservation, game management, and damage mitigation. Males had in general larger home ranges than females, and the majority of the males also made a seasonal migration to and from the rutting areas. The license system area in the agricultural-forest landscape is large enough to manage migrating males. In the forest landscape, a coordination of several management areas is needed to encompass male migrations. We conclude that management needs to adapt to deer spatial use in different types of landscapes to reach set goals.</jats:p>

TI  - Viticultural landscapes: Localised transformations over the past 150 years through an analysis of three case studies in Slovakia
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The transformation of vineyard landscapes is evaluated in this article by assessing the changes in land cover and landscape diversity in selected study areas in two time periods – from 1867 to 1949, and from then to 2016. The study areas are characterised by a long history of viticulture and with important occurrences of old and new agrarian relief forms. Fine-scale land cover and landscape diversity analysis, as well as the study of historical and strategic documents, enabled an accurate interpretation of the viticultural landscape trajectories and their drivers. Landscape diversity was computed using the Shannon diversity index for each 625 square metre grid unit, and applying other metrics for the entire study area. Our research established that the study areas oscillated during this period between extensification and agricultural intensification, and the general trend confirmed the disappearance of traditional vineyards and a decline in modernised vineyard areas after socialism. Although extensification and intensification are seemingly contradictory processes, it is established that these both increase landscape diversity. In addition, landscape diversity changes in the second period are influenced more by changes in quantitative landscape pattern characteristics via edge density than qualitative patterns, e.g. patch richness, which reflect land use diversity.</jats:p>

TI  - Scale and landscape heterogeneity influence the predictive performance of habitat suitability models
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Resource selection functions (RSF) are used to predict habitat selection in a wide range of taxa for various conservation and management purposes. Although such predictions often cover large geographic areas, the limitations of extrapolating beyond the original study region are rarely addressed. Our first research objective was to demonstrate the implications of extrapolating RSF predictions across different habitats and at different spatial scales, with regard to varying landscape characteristics. For our second objective, we investigated the impact of individual variation in resource selection. We used a long-term dataset of GPS-collared lynx from two separate regions in Sweden. We built individual-level RSF models at two spatial scales for two different study regions to quantify individual and regional variation in habitat selection, and extrapolated the results from each region across the opposing study area. Individual lynx selected resources differently within and between study regions, and predictions were more accurate within home ranges than between home ranges. When extrapolating across variable landscapes, encountering resource values outside the fitted range of the models led to incorrect predictions. This case study highlights the importance of quantifying a variable’s value range in both the model and extrapolation area, taking into account variation in individual resource selection, and understanding the relationship with the order of selection to improve the reliability of habitat predictions. To increase the transferability of models, extrapolations should ideally be limited to areas with overlapping value ranges, to reduce the risk of misidentifying habitat suitability.</jats:p>

TI  - Long-term effects and cost-benefit analysis of eight spawning gravel augmentations for Atlantic salmon and Brown trout in Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - River regulation alters flow and sediment regime, habitat availability, and ultimately the ecological functioning of rivers. Various restoration and mitigation measures have been developed to improve ecological function, and among them is the addition of gravel to enhance the reproduction of gravel bed spawning fishes. However, information on long-term efficiency, costs, and maintenance needs of gravel additions are scarce. Here, we study the functioning of gravel additions at eight sites in three rivers in western Norway for up to 18 years. Gravel was added between 2002 and 2010 to enhance spawning of Atlantic salmon and anadromous Brown trout. We monitored changes in the size of the gravel-covered areas, sediment composition, interstitial oxygen, egg survival, and juvenile fish densities. Additionally, we report monetary costs, identify potential maintenance needs, and calculate a cost-benefit ratio. Juvenile densities of Atlantic salmon and Brown trout increased significantly after the gravel augmentations. After 10–18 years, the median egg survival was still high (> 90%) and sediment conditions were still suitable for salmonid fish reproduction. The areas were, however, shrinking across time (median area reduction 26%), mostly caused by scouring of gravel in the steep, supply-limited, and partly regulated rivers. The average construction costs of spawning gravel augmentations were 11.2 NOK (1.12 €) m−2 year−1. Compared to similar measures elsewhere, the measures have had a long life span (up to 18 years) at relatively low costs. Gravel augmentation was concluded to be a successful management measure that contributed to significantly increased Atlantic salmon and Brown trout reproduction.

TI  - Forest biodiversity and ecosystem services from spruce-birch mixtures: The potential importance of tree spatial arrangement
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract There is increasing empirical support for the biodiversity and ecosystem service (ES) benefits of mixed-species production forests. However, few studies control for the spatial arrangement of the trees within mixtures to determine the influence that clustering the tree species (patch scale mixtures), versus evenly dispersing them (intimate scale mixtures), may have for biodiversity and ES outcomes. To highlight the potential implications of altering tree spatial arrangement in mixtures, and the need to fill related knowledge gaps, here we provide a qualitative multi-disciplinary overview of ecological and socio-economic drivers with the potential to alter biodiversity, ecosystem services, and management-related outcomes from patch versus intimate scale mixtures. We focused our overview on even-aged mixtures of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula pendula or B. pubescens) in Sweden, which enabled us to contrast findings within a biogeographical and silvicultural setting. Specifically, we targeted implications for biodiversity (understory vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, saproxylic beetles, birds), biomass production, harvesting costs, management ease, recreation and aesthetics, cervid game, as well as abiotic and biotic risks (wind, fire, pathogens, pests, browsing damage). In the absence of direct empirical evidence, we primarily relied on expert inference from theory and relevant empirical studies sourced from the Fennoscandian region, and further afield if needed. Collectively these efforts allowed us to develop a number of informed hypotheses indicating that for spruce-birch mixtures in this region, patch scale mixtures may have the potential to favour the diversity of several forest dependent taxonomic groups, cervid game and reduce harvesting costs, whereas intimate mixtures may have the potential to reduce pathogen and pest damage, and likewise, potentially benefit production outcomes. Current knowledge was too limited, inconsistent or context dependent to even tentatively infer outcomes for fire risk, wind damage, browsing damage, management ease, recreational and aesthetic outcomes. We emphasize that our hypotheses require testing, but are sufficient to i) highlight the likely importance of spatial-scale to biodiversity and ecosystem services outcomes in mixed-species production forests, ii) caution against generalization from mixture studies that lack scale considerations, and iii) motivate the targeted consideration of spatial grain in future mixture studies.

TI  - Responsible tourists in the time of Covid-19?
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p> COVID-19 effectively stopped tourism mobilities for a time. Theoretically, this qualitative study draws on the notion of responsibility, as in responsibility to act and responsibility to Otherness. We explore how, during the pandemic, Norwegian tourists dealt with infection preventive measures, how they changed travel habits and how the pandemic transformed their thinking on tourism and climate change. The tourists were loyal citizens adhering to the authorities’ measures and refrained from international holidays, thereby taking responsibility for the governmentally enforced dugnad (collective efforts). This temporal change in travel habits, however, was not expected to become the new normal, as warmer, southern destinations were still desired. Culturally embedded neoliberal values of freedom of movement were, for most of these tourists, stronger than the threat of climate crisis. Fatalistically, we conclude that COVID-19 did not have the power to transform their mind-sets regarding responsible tourism futures and free them from neoliberal shackles. </jats:p>

TI  - Mapping cumulative pressures on the grazing lands of northern Fennoscandia.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Traditional grazing areas in Europe have declined substantially over the last century. Specifically, in northern Fennoscandia, the grazing land is disturbed by cumulative land-use pressures. Here we analysed the configuration of the grazing land for reindeer and sheep in northern Fennoscandia in relation to the concurrent land-use pressures from tourism, road and railway networks, forestry, industrial and wind energy facilities, together with predator presence and climate change. Our results show that 85% of the region is affected by at least one land-use pressure and 60% is affected by multiple land-use pressures, co-occurring with predator presence and rising temperatures. As such, a majority of the grazing land is exposed to cumulative pressures in northern Fennoscandia. We stress that, if the expansion of cumulative pressures leads to grazing abandonment of disturbed areas and grazing intensification in other areas, it could irreversibly change northern vegetation and the Fennoscandian mountain landscape.

TI  - Surface Wildfire Regime and Simulation-Based Wildfire Exposure in the Golestan National Park, NE Iran
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>This research analyzes the spatiotemporal patterns of wildfire regime attributes (e.g., seasonality, size, frequency, and burn rate) across the Golestan National Park (GNP), northeast Iran over the last two decades. We used a variety of data, including existing vegetation data, current vegetation survey, and historical wildfire data, and then data were processed through ArcMap. We also predicted fire exposure profiles (burn probability (BP), conditional flame length (CFL (m)), and fire size (FS (ha)) by the application of the minimum travel time (MTT) fire spread algorithm. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method was used to estimate wildfire likelihood, based on recent wildfires (2000–2020) that occurred in the GNP. Finally, we developed a logistic regression model to investigate how independent variables such as weather, fuel, and topographic data influence wildfires in the park. Wildfires in the landscape have not been constant in either space or time. Their extent, seasonality, frequency, and other wildfire regime characters varied considerably across the landscape. Our results highlighted that shrublands in the southern part of the park showed, in general, the highest values in terms of the wildfire regime attributes. Large fires (10–100 ha, 51%) and very large fires (&gt;100 ha, 24%), fire intervals greater than 10 years (90%), and high burn rates (&gt;1% y−1, 35%) are all characteristics that contribute to high wildfire activity in shrublands. Similarly, areas predicted to have high wildfire exposure levels (average BP = 0.004; average CFL = 1.60 m; average FS = 840 ha) are found in the fuel models of high-load grass and medium-load shrub. Finally, the regression model results revealed that weather and fuel were the most influential parameters (R2 ≥ 0.2), while topography had comparatively less influence in the study area. In light of these results, we suggest proactively incorporating this information into fire and fuel management which can help develop a fire prevention plan, predict fire ignition probability and frequency, and finally address altered fire regimes threatening the park.</jats:p>

TI  - Urban Bird Community Assembly Mechanisms and Driving Factors in University Campuses in Nanjing, China.
PY  - 2023
AB  - University campuses are important components of cities, harboring the majority of urban biodiversity. In this study, based on monthly bird survey data covering 12 university campuses located either downtown or in the newly developed areas in Nanjing, China, in 2019, we studied the assembly processes of each campus's bird population and their main drivers by modeling a set of ecological and landscape determinants. Our results showed that (1) bird abundance and species diversity in the newly developed areas were significantly higher than in those downtown; (2) the phylogeny of bird communities in all universities followed a pattern of aggregation, indicating that environmental filtering played a major role in community assembly; (3) specifically, grass, water, and buildings were the main factors affecting each campus's bird community's functional and phylogenetic diversity, with the areas of grass and water habitats having a significant positive correlation with phylogenetic diversity, while the size of building areas was negatively correlated. Our results emphasize that habitat features play a decisive role in determining urban bird population diversity and community assembly processes. We suggest that increasing landscape diversity, e.g., by reasonably arranging the location and area of water bodies and grasslands and improving the landscape connectivity, could be a powerful way to maintain and promote urban bird diversity.

TI  - Sustainable Development Goals and risks: The Yin and the Yang of the paths towards sustainability.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The United Nations 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) define a path towards a sustainable future, but given that uncertainty characterises the outcomes of any SDG-related actions, risks in the implementation of the Agenda need to be addressed. At the same time, most risk assessments are narrowed to sectoral approaches and do not refer to SDGs. Here, on the basis of a literature review and workshops, it is analysed how SDGs and risks relate to each other's in different communities. Then, it is formally demonstrated that, as soon as the mathematical definition of risks is broadened to embrace a more systemic perspective, acting to maintain socio-environmental systems within their sustainability domain can be done by risk minimisation. This makes Sustainable Development Goals and risks "the Yin and the Yang of the paths towards sustainability". Eventually, the usefulness of the SDG-risk nexus for both sustainability and risk management is emphasized.

TI  - A Review of the Life Cycle Analysis Results for Different Energy Conversion Technologies
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Technologies that use renewable energy sources (RES) are crucial to achieving decarbonization goals, but a significant number of studies show their relatively high environmental impact during the production phase. Therefore, technologies need to be compared in terms of their life-cycle environmental impact. The life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology is well known and widely employed. However, problems related to the methodological choices prevent taking full advantage of the LCA, as the results of numerous studies are often incomparable. The presented review aims to critically compare the impact of different energy generation technologies—RES (as well as non-RES) energy generators and co-generators. The numeric results are structured and analyzed in terms of the global warming potential (GWP) and non-RES primary energy consumption. The results show that RES technologies are superior compared to conventional fossil-fuel-based systems in most cases, and the high impact during the production and installation phases is compensated in the operational phase. The high variations in GWP from similar technologies result from different methodological choices, but they also show that the wrong choice of the technology in a certain location might cause serious environmental drawbacks when the impact of the RES technology exceeds the impact of fossil fuel-based technologies. Cogeneration technologies using waste as a fuel may even have a negative GWP impact, thus showing even higher potential for decarbonization than RES technologies.</jats:p>

TI  - Effect of human activity on habitat selection in the endangered Barbary macaque
PY  - 2019
AB  - The exponential growth of human population and infrastructure is significantly reducing the amount of ecological resources available for wild animals. We analyzed the effect of human activity on Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), an endangered species restricted to the fragmented forests of Morocco and Algeria, using location data from five social groups inhabiting Ifrane National Park, Morocco. We used a resource selection function to explore the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on macaque habitat selection, using nine natural, social, and anthropogenic disturbance variables as predictors. Forest cover, home range overlap, herding route proximity, and road proximity were all significant predictors of habitat use. Macaques avoided areas used by local shepherds, to reduce the risk of attack by shepherds’ dogs, but approached roads to increase the chances of provisioning by tourists. However, herding route and road use varied seasonally in line with levels of human use, suggesting that macaques may be navigating their environment strategically (in space and time) to balance food acquisition and risk avoidance. The results of this study highlight the importance of assessing human impact on habitat selection in both space and time. Our data on seasonal variations in macaques’ use of roads can help prevent road injuries, a major source of mortality for provisioned macaques, by focusing management efforts by national park workers in time and space. Furthermore, understanding when and where macaques seek provisioning from tourists can help combat provisioning, which negatively impacts macaque health, behavior, and susceptibility to poaching.

TI  - Archival Analysis of Slash-And-Burn Agriculture in the Northern Ural Mountains at the End of the Nineteenth Century
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the northern territories of the Russian Plain and western piedmont of Northern Ural Mountains were under various land-use systems, including slash-and-burn (SAB) agriculture. Using archival materials for the years 1880–1910 as data sources, we analyse the the location and extent of SAB agriculture, it timing, and its impact on the landscapes at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and present a review of the historical and ethnographic literature. The study area is in the western piedmont of the Northern Ural Mountains, between the Kama and Pechora rivers in dark conifer dominated forests. The population is sparse (14 people per 100 km² in 1900) and settled along the rivers. In 1885 the practice of SAB agriculture was totally prohibited, but the unusually large crop harvest during the first years of the ban led people to risk breaking the law. Between the years 1885 and 1894 a total number of 175 SAB cases was recorded in the study area. The SAB sites were used only once before being abandoned. The recorded plots were usually cultivated by one family. They small (0.03 ha to 2.70 ha, with a median of 0.55 ha) and located within 7.5 km of the settlements. The practice SAB agriculture led to the formation of mosaics of multiple-aged pyrogenic forest associations near the settlements.</jats:p>

TI  - A multistate Langevin diffusion for inferring behavior-specific habitat selection and utilization distributions.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The identification of important habitat and the behavior(s) associated with it is critical to conservation and place-based management decisions. Behavior also links life-history requirements and habitat use, which are key to understanding why animals use certain habitats. Animal population studies often use tracking data to quantify space use and habitat selection, but they typically either ignore movement behavior (e.g., foraging, migrating, nesting) or adopt a two-stage approach that can induce bias and fail to propagate uncertainty. We develop a habitat-driven Langevin diffusion for animals that exhibit distinct movement behavior states, thereby providing a novel single-stage statistical method for inferring behavior-specific habitat selection and utilization distributions in continuous time. Practitioners can customize, fit, assess, and simulate our integrated model using the provided R package. Simulation experiments demonstrated that the model worked well under a range of sampling scenarios as long as observations were of sufficient temporal resolution. Our simulations also demonstrated the importance of accounting for different behaviors and the misleading inferences that can result when these are ignored. We provide case studies using plains zebra (Equus quagga) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) telemetry data. In the zebra example, our model identified distinct "encamped" and "exploratory" states, where the encamped state was characterized by strong selection for grassland and avoidance of other vegetation types, which may represent selection for foraging resources. In the sea lion example, our model identified distinct movement behavior modes typically associated with this marine central-place forager and, unlike previous analyses, found foraging-type movements to be associated with steeper offshore slopes characteristic of the continental shelf, submarine canyons, and seamounts that are believed to enhance prey concentrations. This is the first single-stage approach for inferring behavior-specific habitat selection and utilization distributions from tracking data that can be readily implemented with user-friendly software. As certain behaviors are often more relevant to specific conservation or management objectives, practitioners can use our model to help inform the identification and prioritization of important habitats. Moreover, by linking individual-level movement behaviors to population-level spatial processes, the multistate Langevin diffusion can advance inferences at the intersection of population, movement, and landscape ecology.

TI  - Changes in landscape structure and ecosystem services since 1850 analyzed using landscape metrics in two German municipalities
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land use has fundamentally altered landscape structure and ecosystem service provision over the last century in central Europe and worldwide. In this study, we analyzed long-term changes in landscape structures and ecosystem services in two case study areas in Germany in 1850 and 2018. First, we reconstructed land use changes using historical and current serial cadastral maps, historical documents, and digital aerial photographs. Second, we analyzed landscape structure by calculating select landscape metrics for several land-use types in both case study areas and time steps. Land use analysis for the first case study in the intensively used agricultural area of Jesewitz (Saxony) showed a significantly decreased percentage of grassland from 9.2% (in 1850) to 3.9% (in 2018) and an increase in built-up areas from 1.2% to 3.8%. For the second study area, located in the mountainous region of Ilsenburg, Harz (Saxony-Anhalt), the analysis revealed a stable forest area of 78% at both time steps. Grasslands dominated the non-forest areas and showed a significant decrease in area from 53.2% (in 1850) to 19.6% (in 2018). The settlement area increased markedly from 1.8% to 16.4%. Business and industrial areas also increased significantly from 0.9% to 10.0%. The present study shows that the risk of soil degradation caused by erosion has increased significantly since 1850. Furthermore, the risk of biodiversity loss has increased significantly owing to habitat degradation and devastation of vegetation structures. Moreover, the results showed that changes in landscape structure adversely affected the availability and quality of ecosystem services.

TI  - Assessing energy justice in climate change policies: an empirical examination of China's energy transition
PY  - 2023
AB  - ABSTRACTAn energy transition programme based on the principles of energy justice is an important way to mitigate climate change; however, empirical studies on energy justice remain scarce. This study explores key aspects of energy transition policy implementation in China, using three dimensions of energy justice – distributional, recognition and procedural justice – to establish an analytical framework and help develop quantification methodologies. We focused on Luquan District, Shijiazhuang City (Hebei Province, China), to assess energy justice levels following the implementation of China’s ‘coal-to-gas’ energy transition policy in rural regions. The findings indicate that China’s rural energy policy has not delivered energy justice. Analysis revealed a markedly low procedural justice index, registering a mere 0.37 on a scale of 0–1, attributable to factors such as the lack of involvement of rural households and a lack of transparency in the design and formulation of policy, as well as a lack of access of rural households to policy-related information. Furthermore, insufficient acknowledgment of the needs of specific groups during the energy transition has negatively impacted recognition justice, resulting in a mid-level index value of 0.69. By comparison, this study shows reveals a reasonably high energy distributional justice index value of 0.89. These findings suggest the need for the government to enhance energy policy communication and responsiveness to its stakeholders, to acknowledge and fairly address the energy transition needs of rural consumers, and to implement targeted energy subsidies to augment distributional justice and preclude the waste of limited financial resources. The analytical framework and calculation methods presented here could contribute to quantifying energy justice levels and to informing energy transition policy both in China and more broadly elsewhere in the world.Key policy insightsSince 2013, implementation of China’s ‘coal-to-gas’ energy transition policy has engendered impacts on different dimensions of social justice that have influenced the realization of a just transition.A composite index system is established, encompassing distributional justice, recognition justice, and procedural justice, and quantitative exploration of energy justice is undertaken using a reverse deduction method.The greatest losses in justice, following implementation of China’s ‘coal-to-gas’ energy transition policy, are related to procedural justice, whereas recognition justice incurs moderate losses, and distributional justice experiences the lowest level of losses.Acknowledging the disparities among different groups, the ideal allocation of energy subsidies should be actualized through preliminary surveys, consultation and coordination, thereby preventing resource wastage.Recognizing individual rights and guaranteeing that the policy implementation process is open, transparent and participatory, could enhance energy justice and movement toward a just transition in the context of climate change policy.KEYWORDS: Energy justiceloss of justicerural energy transitioncoal-to-gas policyjust transition AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to all editors for their helpful comments and suggestions, which have helped improve the quality of this paper considerably.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 The unit ‘mu’ is a Chinese measurement of unit area, where 1 mu is equivalent to 1/15th of a hectare, i.e., 3 mu translates to 0.2 ha.Additional informationFundingThis research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant Nos 2022YFC3800705, 2018YFD1100102 and 2018YFC1509007) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 41801208, 41371529 and 41071353).

TI  - Influences of Climate Change and Land Use Change on the Habitat Suitability of Bharal in the Sanjiangyuan District, China.
PY  - 2022
AB  - One of the biggest dangers to the degradation of biodiversity worldwide is climate change. Its oscillations in the future could result in potential alterations to species populations and habitat structure. With Sanjiangyuan District as the study site, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized to investigate the number and location of the bharal (<i>Pseudois nayaur</i>). The Maximum Entropy model and the Minimum Cumulative Resistance model (MaxEnt-MCR) were coupled to simulate the distribution of wildlife. On this basis, the future geographical distribution of bharal under different climate scenarios was simulated, and the ecological corridor and habitat centroid of bharal were revealed. The results showed that the suitable area of the bharal habitat was 4669 km<sup>2</sup>, which was mainly concentrated in the Maduo, Qumalai, and Gonghe counties. The potential distribution of the species under different future climate scenarios had a decreasing trend. Under the SSP-245 scenario, the habitat area of bharal in 2030 and 2050 decreased by 25.68 and 44.61% compared with the present situation and cumulatively decreased by 1199 and 2083 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Under the SSP-585 scenario, the habitat area of bharal in 2030 and 2050 decreased by 27.5 and 48.44%, with a total reduction of 1284 and 2262 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, a complete loss of habitat was predicted in Gonghe County by 2050. In addition, it was observed that the landscape structure in Sanjiangyuan District would be more fragmented and complex. The continued climate change will seriously affect the habitat distribution of this species. Therefore, preventive measures, such as protecting habitat areas and establishing ecological corridors for bharal, should be implemented in the Sanjiangyuan District. Such measures should not focus solely on the potential degradation but should also be extended to include potential distribution areas for future migration.

TI  - Who decides? The governance of rewilding in Scotland 'between the cracks': community participation, public engagement, and partnerships
PY  - 2023
AB  - Rewilding is a conservation approach which seeks to restore natural processes and ecosystem functionality. However, it also has a strong social dimension, characterised by a recently increasing emphasis on the place of people in rewilding. The role of local communities and the need for public engagement have become a specific concern for many contemporary rewilding efforts. Research on the role of participation in rewilding is however lacking, with rewilding governance in general being under-explored. Our examination of understandings and practices of rewilding governance, through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in Scotland, illustrated a range of conceptualisations and approaches. It became apparent that governance and participatory practices were very variable and selective, highlighting an interaction between land ownership and degrees of empowerment which underpinned rewilding activity and decision-making. Approaches ranged from relatively ubiquitous advocacy for public engagement with a pre-prescribed rewilding agenda, through the circumscribed participation of defined communities (mainly of interest) in specific activities, to much more involved and empowering but self-selecting partnerships (with other landowners) to achieve impact at scale. Key challenges to more participatory approaches in rewilding identified included: i) a strong conservation imperative; ii) concentrated ownership, and power and control over land; and iii) emerging ideas about the public interest. These influenced perceptions about the value, and the practice of greater representation in rewilding decisions, ultimately bounding and limiting the participation of communities and the public.

TI  - Concentrated Solar Power and Photovoltaic Systems: A New Approach to Boost Sustainable Energy for All (Se4all) in Rwanda
PY  - 2021
AB  - The energy sector of today’s Rwanda has made a remarkable growth to some extent in recent years. Although Rwanda has natural energy resources (e.g., hydro, solar, and methane gas, etc.), the country currently has an installed electricity generation capacity of only 226.7 MW from its 45 power plants for a population of about 13 million in 2021. The current national rate of electrification in Rwanda is estimated to 54.5% (i.e.; 39.7% grid-connected and 14.8% off-grid connected systems). This clearly demonstrates that having access to electricity is still a challenge to numerous people not to mention some blackout-related problems. With the ambition of having electricity for all, concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) systems are regarded as solutions to the lack of electricity. The production of CSP has still not been seriously considered in Rwanda, even though the technology has attracted significant global attention. Heavy usage of conventional power has led to the depletion of fossil fuels. At the same time, it has highlighted its unfriendly relationship with the environment because of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which is a major cause of global warming. Solar power is another source of electricity that has the potential to generate electricity in Rwanda. Firstly, this paper summarizes the present status of CSP and PV systems in Rwanda. Secondly, we conducted a technoeconomic analysis for CSP and PV systems by considering their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). The input data of the SWOT analysis were obtained from relevant shareholders from the government, power producers, minigrid, off-grid, and private companies in Rwanda. Lastly, the technical and economical feasibilities of CSP and PV microgrid systems in off-grid areas of Rwanda were conducted using the system advisor model (SAM). The simulation results indicate that the off-grid PV microgrid system for the rural community is the most cost-effective because of its low net present cost (NPC). According to the past literature, the outcomes of this paper through the SWOT analyses and the results obtained from the SAM model, both the CSP and PV systems could undoubtedly play a vital role in Rwanda’s rural electrification. In fact, PV systems are strongly recommended in Rwanda because they are rapid and cost-effective ways to provide utility-scale electricity for off-grid modern energy services to the millions of people who lack electricity access.

TI  - Observations on bark-stripping by red deer in a Picea sitchensis forest in Western Scotland over a 35-year period
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACTThe impact of bark-stripping by red deer on an 1825 ha plantation of Picea sitchensis is reported. Monitoring began in 1978 with initially 6500 trees at 37 sites; by 2014, only 10 sites remained due to felling. Sites became vulnerable to bark-stripping once the trees reached 7 years’ age, and from then until felling at age c. 45 years, incidence rates averaged 1% of the trees damaged yearly. Intense damage at a site in a year (>2% trees damaged) was often followed by intense damage next year, but, on average, 53% of sites were undamaged in a year. Many trees suffered repeat wounding, which reduced final impact by c. 30% compared to the theoretical impact calculated from annual damage and damage duration. The trees bark-stripped were on average smaller than plot mean girths once these means exceeded 20 cm; this had only a minor effect on the final impact since bark-stripped small trees had similar mortality to undamaged small trees. Most wounds (>90%) were small (<180 cm2) and healed quickly, so we...

TI  - Nutrient balancing or spring flush – What determines spruce bark stripping level by red deer?
PY  - 2022
AB  - The distribution and population density of red deer (Cervus elaphus) are increasing in several regions of Europe. The deer may cause severe damage in commercial forestry and agriculture. Bark stripping is the main problem in forests, especially on Norway spruce (Picea abies), and is thought to mostly occur during winter when other forage is scarce. It has been suggested that an imbalance in the nutrient intake, and especially a diet including high amounts of easily-digestible macronutrients, such as agricultural crops, can lead to an increased urge to consume bark. Feeding on brassicas, for example rapeseed (Brassica napus) might have this effect. The aim with this study was to investigate the relationship between intake of rapeseed and bark stripping on Norway spruce by red deer during early spring. We did this by a controlled feeding experiment with four groups of captive red deer in southern Sweden. All groups were given spruce logs every week, while only two groups had access to freshly harvested rapeseed plants. In addition, influence of air temperature and forage nutritional composition was taken into account. Our results show that red deer bark stripping can be considerable not only during winter but also during spring green-up. We found no significant influence of rapeseed on bark stripping performed by the deer. However, at a threshold temperature, deer suddenly started to ingest large amounts of bark biomass, coinciding with a significant change in the bark’s concentration of starch. We suggest that the lack of effect of rapeseed feeding can partly be explained by overshadowing effects caused by such seasonal changes of bark characteristics, and partly by the fact that the rapeseed plants in our study contained lower than expected concentrations of easily-digestible macronutrients (apart from protein). We conclude that the risk of damage on spruce can be especially high during certain periods, something that is important to consider when mitigating bark stripping. However, several interactive effects are involved and must be considered in order to more efficiently mitigate damage.

TI  - Cultural dimension of wolves in the Iberian Peninsula: implications of ethnozoology in conservation biology
PY  - 2011
AB  - In the Iberian Peninsula, the coexistence between pastoral communities and wolves has given origin to a rich ethnographic heritage, expressed in myths and legends, practices related to medical uses of wolf parts, and constructions for hunting wolves. This article assesses such cultural dimension through interviews with inhabitants, field prospecting and a literature review. Our review indicates that cultural manifestations related to wolves are associated with two distinct perceptions of this carnivore: as a real threat to livestock and as a symbolic creature. This cultural legacy is still present in the memory and practices of Iberian rural communities and is unparalleled in other European regions. Ethnographic knowledge can enhance our understanding of the perceptions of local people towards the wolf and help to promote the recreational and utilitarian value of this species as an important element in rural culture and tradition. Such an approach can be crucial in attenuating wolf–human conflict in human...

TI  - Spatial energy density of large-scale electricity generation from power sources worldwide.
PY  - 2022
AB  - This paper introduces the annual energy density concept for electric power generation, which is proposed as an informative metric to capture the impacts on the environmental footprint. Our investigation covers a wide range of sources classified by rated power and compares different regions to establish typical spatial flows of energy and evaluate the corresponding scalability to meet future net-zero emission (NZE) goals. Our analysis is conducted based on publicly available information pertaining to different regions and remote satellite image data. The results of our systematic analysis indicate that the spatial extent of electric power generation toward 2050 will increase approximately sixfold, from approximately 0.5% to nearly 3.0% of the world's land area, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) NZE 2050 targets. We investigate the worldwide energy density for ten types of power generation facilities, two involving nonrenewable sources (i.e., nuclear power and natural gas) and eight involving renewable sources (i.e., hydropower, concentrated solar power (CSP), solar photovoltaic (PV) power, onshore wind power, geothermal power, offshore wind power, tidal power, and wave power). In total, our study covers 870 electric power plants worldwide, where not only the energy density but also the resulting land or sea area requirements to power the world are estimated. Based on the provided meta-analysis results, this paper challenges the common notion that solar power is the most energy-dense renewable fuel source by demonstrating that hydropower supersedes solar power in terms of land use in certain regions of the world, depending on the topography.

TI  - From historical map to online 3D recreation: the 1861 cadastral map of Horta (Barcelona)
PY  - 2015
AB  - The recent study and classification of over 200 cadastral maps created in the nineteenth century in Catalonia have provided a valuable source of information about the agricultural landscape country’s past, but by linking them with data recorded in tax books known as amillaramientos, it is possible to gain a better knowledge of the past. By applying this method to the 1861 cadastral map of Horta and its corresponding amillaramiento, a planimetric map showing the land use distribution in the town was created. The resulting land use map was subsequently overlaid on top of a digital elevation model to create 3D visualizations which show the altitudinal distribution of crops and other features. Finally, the article explores a way of distributing the results online, making them accessible to the public and increasing the research impact of future findings. Therefore, the method described in this article allows the systematic recreation and distribution of past landscapes by using Catalan cadastral maps of the n...

TI  - First Spatial Reconstruction of Past Fires in Temperate Europe Suggests Large Variability of Fire Sizes and an Important Role of Human-Related Ignitions
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The spatial component of past forest fires in temperate Europe has been little studied, despite the value of such data in quantifying human and natural factors driving fire activity and associated forest dynamics. Changes in fire regimes reported across a range of ecosystems call for a better understanding of variability in historic fires and may help define reference points that can be relied upon when discussing climate change effects. We provide the first dendrochronological reconstruction of historical fire sizes in Central Europe and analyze the minimum extent of fires during the last four centuries in a 9.2 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (920 ha) conifer-dominated section of Białowieża Forest, one of the largest continuous lowland forests of the subcontinent. We recorded 82 fires between 1666 and 1946, using 275 sample trees, while 92% of fires (76 out of 82) spread beyond the studied area. Fires varied considerably in size, from events recorded at only one site (1–200 ha) to fires recorded in more than half of the studied area, thus exceeding 500 ha in size. The fire cycle was 11 years over the whole study period, with three distinct periods revealed by the regime shift analysis. In the years 1670–1750, the fire cycle averaged 12 years. It shortened to 7 years between 1755–1840 and increased to 22 years over the 1845–1955 period. In comparison with present day data, the reconstructed fire density of 3.2 fires per 100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (10 000 ha) and year exceeded lightning ignition density by one to two orders of magnitude, suggesting a significant contribution of human-related ignitions. Our results highlight the important role of fire disturbance in Białowieża Forest and provide critical baseline information to design biological conservation strategies for European forests.</jats:p>

TI  - New indicator of habitat functionality reveals high risk of underestimating trade-offs among sustainable development goals: The case of wild reindeer and hydropower.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Although biodiversity is crucial for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), following the current trajectory, we risk failing SDG 15. Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km<sup>2</sup> of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km<sup>2</sup>). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km<sup>2</sup>) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs. Using indices of functional connectivity is crucial for environmental impact assessments, as entire ecological networks for several species can be affected far beyond the reservoirs.

TI  - Rapid ecological response and intensified knowledge accumulation following a north European mega-fire
PY  - 2019
AB  - Deepened knowledge on response of biota and ecological processes following fire is essential for a future with warmer climate and more disturbances. In 2014 the first mega-fire (13,100 ha) for at least a century in Scandinavia hit south-central Sweden, in a production forest landscape shaped by clearcutting forestry. Ecological dynamics is followed in >20 projects from universities, authorities and citizen science initiatives, rapidly accumulating substantial amounts of data. We outline projects and summarize their results during the first four years, demonstrating a rapid succession of fungi, lichens, vascular plants, birds, mammals, ticks, butterflies, beetles, and drastically altered carbon dynamics. We characterize forest operations including regeneration measures and point to patterns in pest and pathogen infestations. 8,000 ha is set aside for natural succession, with the rest harvested and managed for forest production, offering excellent opportunities for studies on salvage logging effects, already evident for birds. We demonstrate a strong regrowth of deciduous trees, and the protected part will in some decades likely develop into the largest deciduous-dominated area in boreal north Europe outside Russia. Continued studies of biodiversity and ecological processes are urgent for this unique area.

TI  - Moose in our neighborhood: Does perceived hunting risk have cascading effects on tree performance in vicinity of roads and houses?
PY  - 2022
AB  - Like large carnivores, hunters both kill and scare ungulates, and thus might indirectly affect plant performance through trophic cascades. In this study, we hypothesized that intensive hunting and enduring fear of humans have caused moose and other forest ungulates to partly avoid areas near human infrastructure (perceived hunting risk), with positive cascading effects on recruitment of trees. Using data from the Norwegian forest inventory, we found decreasing browsing pressure and increasing tree recruitment in areas close to roads and houses, where ungulates are more likely to encounter humans. However, although browsing and recruitment were negatively related, reduced browsing was only responsible for a small proportion of the higher tree recruitment near human infrastructure. We suggest that the apparently weak cascading effect occurs because the recorded browsing pressure only partly reflects the long-term browsing intensity close to humans. Accordingly, tree recruitment was also related to the density of small trees 5-10 years earlier, which was higher close to human infrastructure. Hence, if small tree density is a product of the browsing pressure in the past, the cascading effect is probably stronger than our estimates suggest. Reduced browsing near roads and houses is most in line with risk avoidance driven by fear of humans (behaviorally mediated), and not because of excessive hunting and local reduction in ungulate density (density mediated).

TI  - Unnatural Pumas and Domestic Foxes: Relations with Protected Predators and Conspiratorial Rumours in Southern Chile
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Human-wildlife conflicts involving protected predators are a major social and environmental problem worldwide. A critical aspect in such conflicts is the role of state institutions regarding predators' conservation, and how this is construed by affected local populations. These interpretations are frequently embodied in conspiratorial rumours, sharing some common traits related to wild and domestic categories, spatial ordering and power relations. In southern Chile, a one-year, multi-sited ethnographic study of human-animal relations in and adjacent to protected areas was undertaken, foregrounding conspiratorial rumours concerning protected predators. Through an analysis of this study and related international cases, this article argues that the uncritical dismissal of rumours and the categories used to interpret such conflicts have detrimental impacts on the conservation of wild predators. Such rumours should be understood as significant comment devices within human-animal relations and the power dynamics that frame human groups affected by them.</jats:p>

TI  - Differing perceptions and tensions among tourists and locals concerning a national park region in Norway
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the context of national park management, landscape conservation, and tourism development in a mountain region in Norway, the aim of the research is to analyse how tourists, residents, and local stakeholders experience and practise their participation in the landscapes. A mixed methods approach was used, which included focus group meetings, semi-structured interviews, an on-site survey, and two Internet surveys to gain in-depth knowledge of tourists' and locals' relations to and evaluations of the landscape in the studied national park region, which comprised the park itself and eight protected landscape areas. The results revealed that many of the tourists visiting the national park considered the area it covered was a wilderness, while locals considered the area's authenticity was closely connected to cultural traditions and a long-lasting interconnectedness between people and landscape. As both locals and tourists shared a desire to maintain the wildlife and landscape characteristics of the national park, authenticity may serve as a common denominator for emphasizing local development, outdoor activities, and meeting points outside the boundary of the park. The authors conclude that involving tourists in a knowledge process that provides insights into the past and present livelihoods of communities and the use of the natural resources could help to enhance tourists' experiences, but without compromising local understandings of authenticity.

TI  - The social stereotypes of wolves and brown bears
PY  - 2022
AB  - Large carnivores are challenging to conserve because people are ambivalent. This research analyzed the social perception of wolves and brown bears from a novel psychological approach rarely used within conservation: animal species stereotypes (category-based generalizations). Spanish college students ascribed 17 characteristics to wolves (Study 1, N = 144 participants) and 18 to brown bears (Study 2, N = 199). Four domains – Physical (e.g., beautiful) Species-related (carnivorous), Cognitive (cunning), and Social (dangerous) – captured the stereotype content of both species, with the Social (Physical) domain being more relevant for wolves and bears. Results indicated that people a) identified stereotypes for large carnivores, as they do for people; and b) held ambivalent stereotypes (including positive and negative characteristics). Findings extend the stereotype content model and can inform the conservation of large carnivores in the 21st century.

TI  - Albic Podzols of Boreal Pine Forests of Russia: Soil Organic Matter, Physicochemical and Microbiological Properties across Pyrogenic History
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Albic podzols under pine forests are more prone to fires on the planet. The influence of fire extends to all soil components, including chemical properties, microbiological characteristics, and the composition and structure of soil organic matter, which persists for a long time. Here, we present the results of a study of the morphological, physicochemical, and microbiological properties and features of soil organic matter (SOM) in the albic podzols of pine forests (Pinus sylvestris L.) not exposed to fires for a long time (from 45 to 131 years). The study areas are characterized by different numbers of old fires (from four to five) that occurred over the previous several centuries in various territories of the Russian Federation such as Central Siberia (CS) and the European North (EN). In general, the albic podzols developing in CS and EN are characterized by similar morphological and physicochemical properties, with high acidity and poor mineral horizons. In terms of the lower vegetation layer and stand parameters, forest communities at the CS sites have a lower density and species diversity than those in EN. The ground cover is almost completely restored 45 years after the surface fire. The upper mineral horizon of albic podzols in EN contains higher PAHs in comparison with similar horizons of the CS sites. In the soil of EN pine forests, the MB content in the mineral horizons is, on average, three times higher than those in CS. Differences were also found in the qualitative composition of the studied soils’ microbiomes. The EN soil communities are represented by a wide variety of bacteria and fungi. The presented soil parameters can be used as a reference in assessing the increasing impact of fires on pine forests and podzols.</jats:p>

TI  - Abandoning grassland management negatively influences plant but not bird or insect biodiversity in Europe
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Grasslands are globally distributed and naturally occurring; however, in Europe, most grasslands are anthropogenically created or altered by livestock grazing or mowing. Low‐intensity use and management have led to species‐rich communities in European grasslands. The intensification of crop production and livestock farming with stabling throughout the year has led to an abandonment of grasslands that are no longer economically profitable. In this study, we looked at the influence of grassland abandonment on biodiversity. We hypothesized that abandonment of grasslands decreases the overall biodiversity, but has different effects depending on the focal taxonomic group (i.e., vascular plants, insects, or birds). We also hypothesized that the type of management before abandonment, the type of grassland, and the time after abandonment would influence grassland biodiversity. We conducted a Web of Science search, with pre‐defined terms, to find articles that compared biodiversity of managed and abandoned grasslands in Europe. We screened the articles and included 39 studies in a subsequent meta‐analysis. We found that overall biodiversity was reduced after abandonment; however, the biodiversity reduction in the grasslands differed among taxonomic groups. Plant species diversity was significantly lower after abandonment (plant summary effect size: −0.25 [−0.34; −0.16]), whereas the diversity of insects and birds showed no significant trend, but a visual trend toward an increase. None of the other environmental variables (type of management, type of grassland, or the time after abandonment) had a significant influence on the biodiversity of the grasslands. We conclude that maintaining grassland management is crucial to support biodiversity conservation in European grasslands.</jats:p>

TI  - Mind the gap: exploring the usefulness of historical data to assess the impacts of land-use change on bird diversity in a farmland mosaic of Northeastern Portugal (1980-2000)
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Agriculture intensification and land abandonment are the main threats to bird communities in farmlands. Although they represent the opposite endpoints of a gradient of land-use change, they are usually examined separately. In this study, we assessed the effects of the occurrence of both drivers in space and in time, on bird assemblages. The study was performed in a Mediterranean vineyard-dominated farmland mosaic located in North-Eastern Portugal, where land abandonment and (mechanized) intensification coexisted for twenty years. The aims of this study were (1) to describe the temporal patterns of land-use change; (2) to investigate whether these changes affected the local bird species composition and ecological guild structure; and (3) to assess which species/ecological traits were more responsive to land-use changes. We compared the occurrence of birds before (1979-84) and after (2002-03) the triggering of the land-use change proccess. Results showed the prevalence of three interacting gradients of land-use change: land intensification, and direct and indirect effects of land abandonment. While the composition and ecological structure of the bird communities remained stable during the period analyzed, trait and species-specific analysis showed significant correlations with the gradients of change. This suggest that the local bird communities were able to cope with the synergic dynamics of the land-use change, possibly due to a combination of a resilient pre-change bird assemblage and the buffering effect of the competing drivers. The pros and cons of the approach adopted and the utility of past datasets as baselines to assess and monitor the impacts of environmental change on farmland bird diversity are discussed.</jats:p>

TI  - Coexistence in ecological corridors: understanding tolerance of wolves in the Northwestern Apennines, Italy
PY  - 2022
AB  - Human-wolf (Canis lupus) conservation conflicts in Europe have increased as wolf presence has expanded. Understanding how different stakeholders perceive coexistence, especially in locations identified as ecologically important for wolves is necessary to minimize conflict. We conducted a survey in an area of northwest Italy identified as a critical corridor linking separate, cross-boundary populations. The objective was to understand how stakeholder identities, social demographics, communication, and exposure influence the success of coexistence strategies. The study found conservationists and, significantly, hunters were most positive about wolves, while farmers were least tolerant, irrespective of exposure. Tolerance also correlated positively with higher levels of formal education and engagement with science-based knowledge. In contrast, less tolerant attitudes were influenced more by informal knowledge discourses and age. The article concludes that coexistence strategies need to be inclusive, reflexive and adapted to the specific circumstances of different stakeholder types.

TI  - Under the influence of nature: The contribution of natural capital to tourism spend.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Tourism and outdoor leisure is an important economic sector for many countries, and has a substantial reliance on natural capital. Natural capital may be the primary purpose for tourism, or it may be a secondary factor, where the choice of location for a leisure activity is influenced by natural capital. Typically, when valuing tourism and outdoor leisure, all expenditure associated with the activity is assigned to the ecosystem it occurs in. However, this value illustrates the dependency on natural capital, rather than the contribution of natural capital. In natural capital accounting, a major challenge is to separately identify the contribution of natural capital from that of other forms of capital. In this study we develop a transparent and repeatable method that is able to attribute the contribution of natural capital (here defined as ecosystems) to the output of multiple tourism and outdoor leisure activities. Using national statistics from Great Britain, we calculate the natural capital contribution to tourism spend by activity at a national and regional scale, and for a case study map and value the contributing ecosystems. We estimated that, out of a total £36 billion spent on tourism and leisure activities in 2017, £22.5 billion was attributable to natural capital. This equates to 0.9% of the UK GDP. The Gross Value Added component of this attributable was £10.5 billion, equivalent to 0.4% of the UK GDP. Regions with the highest natural capital contribution in Great Britain were Scotland and Wales, with the lowest being Greater London and the West Midlands in England. For the case study, the ecosystems with the greatest contribution to terrestrial activities were marine and enclosed farmland. These methods can be applied worldwide for anywhere with aggregate economic statistics on expenditure associated with tourism and outdoor leisure, with the aid of open source GIS datasets.

TI  - Urban wildlife corridors: Building bridges for wildlife and people
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Urbanization is rapidly expanding across the globe, leading to increasing threats to wildlife in and around cities. Wildlife corridors are one strategy used to connect fragmented wildlife populations; however, building wildlife corridors in urban areas remains a challenge because of the number of barriers between habitat patches and the extensive number of property owners and stakeholders involved. Successful urban wildlife corridor conservation thus requires a collaborative approach and a cohesive plan that transcends municipal boundaries. Here we demonstrate how urban wildlife corridor conservation can provide a unique opportunity to build bridges not only for wildlife but also among scientists, non-profits, government agencies, and communities. Our case study centers on the conservation of a network of wildlife corridors in one of the world's megacities, Los Angeles, and the positive feedback loop sparked by collaboration between research and non-profit work. We discuss the benefits of and challenges to building complex collaborations for the purpose of strengthening urban resilience and redesigning sustainable cities.</jats:p>

TI  - Pre-Columbian red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) fire regimes of north-central Pennsylvania, USA
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Fire-dependent vegetation communities in the northeastern USA have undergone significant transitions since social and ecological disruptions associated with Euro-American colonization of North America. There is much interest, though little information available, about historical fire regimes of fire-adapted vegetation communities in the northeastern USA in pre-Columbian times (i.e., pre-1492 CE). We intensively investigated a red pine (<jats:italic>Pinus resinosa</jats:italic> Ait.)—oak (<jats:italic>Quercus</jats:italic> spp.) forested landscape in north-central Pennsylvania, USA, for exceptionally old red pine remnants (stumps, snags) where previous research had suggested the potential to develop fire-scar and tree-ring chronologies which extend to time periods prior to 1492.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>Tree-ring and fire-scar chronologies recovered from red pine trees extend back to 1370 and 1402, respectively.

Fire scars provide physical evidence that fire was an important ecological component of this landscape before and after 1492 and that the current period of reduced fire activity is unprecedented in the 500 years prior to fire exclusion practices that were widely adopted circa 1915. Beyond fire scars, the spatial and temporal extent of the red pine tree-ring record provides evidence that red pine, a fire-dependent species, was historically a more important component of this landscape than it is today. The conservation of red pine vegetation communities will require incorporating recurring fire into management plans, for the successful regeneration and perpetuation of red pine, and to sustain associated flora and fauna of conservation concern.</jats:p> </jats:sec>

TI  - Legacies of historic charcoal production affect the forest flora in a Swedish mining district
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Iron production was historically associated with major impacts on forests worldwide, as vast amounts of wood were harvested to produce the charcoal needed for heating the furnaces and reducing iron oxides in the ore to iron. This impact has left abundant legacies which potentially may remain in the present‐day vegetation. We investigated how remains of historic charcoal production, mainly from the 18th to the early 20th century, at still remaining charcoal kiln platforms (CKPs), affect the current species richness, species occurrences and cover of vascular plants in the ground vegetation in a Swedish mining district located in the boreo‐nemoral forest zone. CKPs have a significantly higher species richness than the surrounding forest, and they also affect cover (negatively) for ericaceous species typically dominating the forest ground vegetation. Several forest species are more frequent at CKPs, and these also harbor significantly more uncommon species, of which many are typical for traditionally managed grasslands. These latter species are likely to represent remnants in present‐day forests reflecting former land‐use such as livestock grazing. The soil chemistry at CKPs is strongly deviating from the surrounding forest, and this, together with a lower cover of ericaceous shrubs, are the most likely mechanisms behind the higher species richness. CKPs represent conspicuous and abundant historic anthropogenic habitats in the forest vegetation. As far as we are aware, the flora at CKPs in boreal and boreo‐nemoral forests has not previously been investigated in detail, and they deserve more attention, both from a biological and a cultural–historical perspective.</jats:p>

TI  - Analysis Long-Term and Spatial Changes of Forest Cover in Typical Karst Areas of China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>In recent decades, China has exhibited the fastest and most remarkable social-economic development in the world. As a result of such development, the forest cover of the country has undergone radical changes. This paper aims to develop a method for analyzing long-term and spatial changes in forest cover based on historical maps and remote sensing images. Moreover, we will focus on the reduction or restoration of forests distributed at different altitudes, slopes, soils, and lithologic types in different periods, to reveal the problems that should be paid attention to in forest restoration in karst areas. A typical county of China was selected as the study area. A historical military operation map was considered the principal source of basic data. These data were then combined with Landsat satellite images to conduct quantitative analysis on changes in the spatial area and location of forest cover with a long time series. The findings are as follows: in terms of time series, the forest area in the study area showed a trend of decreasing at first and then increasing, with the year 1986 as the turning point. In terms of spatial patterns, a considerable difference is observed in regions with changes in forest cover under different historical periods. Changes are obvious in limestone areas, rock soil areas, and areas with an elevation of 2000–2500 m and a slope gradient of 6°–15°. Spatial–temporal changes in forest cover reflect the effects of the war, national policy, and economic development to some extent. All these results indicate that, despite its limitations, a historical map is a valuable document for studying an ecological environment.</jats:p>

TI  - A review of reindeer (<i>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</i>) disturbance research in Northern Europe: towards a social-ecological framework?
PY  - 2022
AB  - Disturbance of wild reindeer from human activity is a key challenge for wildlife management. We reviewed recent literature on reindeer disturbance in Northern Europe and discuss a major lacuna in this field of research, namely knowledge about the complexity of human behaviour, which is the major agent of disturbance. Past studies have rarely included detailed data on human activities, but instead treated fixed infrastructure as valid proxies for human presence. However, ignoring the dynamic and flexible nature of human agency as a driver of disturbance may bias our interpretation of the observed responses. We argue that incorporating information about the spatiotemporal patterns of human use of infrastructure and the characteristics of the users may greatly improve our knowledge of the potential impacts on wild and semi-domestic reindeer populations and contribute to improved management of their ranges.

TI  - Socio-cultural values and biophysical supply: How do afforestation and land abandonment impact multiple ecosystem services?
PY  - NA
AB  - Humans have significantly modified the planet’s ecosystems with negative consequences for biodiversity and human wellbeing. However, not all land use is equal, and many traditional land uses, and emergent cultural landscapes support important biodiversity and provide multiple benefits to society. Despite their importance, cultural landscapes are threatened by several factors, the most prominent being abandonment of the traditional practices that maintain them. Afforestation schemes to mitigate atmospheric carbon are an additional emerging threat. Abandonment and afforestation threaten both ecological processes and socio-cultural values, but surprisingly, there is little knowledge on the concurrent social and ecological impacts. We used a multi-method approach of ecological field surveys to quantify the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services (ES) in four different vegetation types representing managed open vegetation, natural forest types for abandonment and planted forests to represent afforestation. We explored the match and/or mismatch between socio-cultural values and biophysical supply of ES in those vegetation types and investigated the socio-demographic factors that influence socio-cultural values for ES. Biophysical supply of ES was variable across vegetation types and synergies were as common as trade-offs. Socio-cultural values were high for most ES in open vegetation and natural forests and low for planted forests. Biophysical supply and socio-cultural values were well matched across the vegetation types for biodiversity and agricultural products, but strongly mismatched for climate regulation. We show that although trade-offs occur both within value- and between value domains, synergies are also common. Our results show that abandonment would impact on the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of some ES but that this impact would be lower than that of afforestation. We argue that our approach can be used to manage trade-offs and enhance synergies between value domains for a holistic approach to landscape stewardship that supports both people and nature.

Parr FL in the East Machias River drainage (mean = 127.7 mm) experienced a decrease of approximately 10 mm during the study period. Density dependence was evident across drainages, suggesting that habitats were at capacity or that parr were experiencing competition. Given that the production of parr in Maine is highly reliant on stock enhancement, localized high stocking densities may limit parr growth without further restoration or habitat improvements. Stocking intensities generally decreased in all three drainages after 2000, possibly relaxing density dependence and partially explaining the plateau or increase in FL during recent years in the Sheepscot and Narraguagus rivers.

AB  - Wilson SM, Brandt DH, Corsi MP, Dux AM. 2017. Early trophic responses to nutrient addition in Dworshak Reservoir, Idaho. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:58–73. Dworshak Reservoir, Idaho, responded favorably across multiple trophic levels after 4 yr of nutrient (primarily ammonium nitrate) additions. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the epilimnion did not increase, suggesting rapid biological uptake. Secchi depth was not significantly lower during the treatment period and chlorophyll a concentrations were unchanged. At the lowest trophic level, densities of heterotrophic bacteria increased by 109% and pico-cyanobacteria increased by 60% for the treatment period. While we did not observe a significant increase in the mean biovolume of phytoplankton, the proportion of Dolichospermum, an inedible taxa, in the phytoplankton community declined by 74%, coupled with a 94% increase in the proportion of the phytoplankton biovolume that was edible to zooplankton. The mean density of Daphnia for the treatment period was 70% higher than the untreated period. In the fourth year of treatment, kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) biomass increased to 233% of the untreated mean and 143% of the highest untreated estimate. Our observations are consistent with reports from similar projects throughout British Columbia, Alaska, and Scandinavia, which suggests ammonium nitrate enrichment should be further explored as a management strategy for mitigating oligotrophication in N limited waters.

TI  - A landscape perspective of Holocene organic carbon cycling in coastal SW Greenland lake-catchments
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Arctic organic carbon (OC) stores are substantial and have accumulated over millennia as a function of changes in climate and terrestrial vegetation. Arctic lakes are also important components of the regional C-cycle as they are sites of OC production and CO2 emissions but also store large amounts of OC in their sediments. This sediment OC pool is a mixture derived from terrestrial and aquatic sources, and sediment cores can therefore provide a long-term record of the changing interactions between lakes and their catchments in terms of nutrient and C transfer. Sediment carbon isotope composition (δ13C), C/N ratio and organic C accumulation rates (C AR) of 14C-dated cores covering the last ∼10,000 years from six lakes close to Sisimiut (SW Greenland) are used to determine the extent to which OC dynamics reflect climate relative to lake or catchment characteristics. Sediment δ13C ranges from −19 to −32‰ across all lakes, while C/N ratios are 20 (mean = 12), values that indicate a high proportion of the organic matter is from autochthonous production but with a variable terrestrial component. Temporal trends in δ13C are variable among lakes, with neighbouring lakes showing contrasting profiles, indicative of site-specific OC processing. The response of an individual lake reflects its morphometry (which influences benthic primary production), the catchment:lake ratio, and catchment relief, lakes with steeper catchments sequester more carbon. The multi-site, landscape approach used here highlights the complex response of individual lakes to climate and catchment disturbance, but broad generalisations are possible. Regional Neoglacial cooling (from ∼5000 cal yr BP) influenced the lateral transfer of terrestrial OC to lakes, with three lakes showing clear increases in OC accumulation rate. The lakes likely switched from being autotrophic (i.e. net ecosystem production > ecosystem respiration) in the early Holocene to being heterotrophic after 5000 cal yr BP as terrestrial OC transfer increased.

TI  - Expanded spatial extent of the Medieval Climate Anomaly revealed in lake‐sediment records across the boreal region in northwest Ontario
PY  - 2012
AB  - Multi-decadal to centennial-scale shifts in effective moisture over the past two millennia are inferred from sedimentary records from six lakes spanning a ~250 km region in northwest Ontario. This is the first regional application of a technique developed to reconstruct drought from drainage lakes (open lakes with surface outlets). This regional network of proxy drought records is based on individual within-lake calibration models developed using diatom assemblages collected from surface sediments across a water-depth gradient. Analysis of diatom assemblages from sediment cores collected close to the near-shore ecological boundary between benthic and planktonic diatom taxa indicated this boundary shifted over time in all lakes. These shifts are largely dependent on climate-driven influences, and can provide a sensitive record of past drought. Our lake-sediment records indicate two periods of synchronous signals, suggesting a common large-scale climate forcing. The first is a period of prolonged aridity during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, c. 900-1400 CE). Documentation of aridity across this region expands the known spatial extent of the MCA megadrought into a region that historically has not experienced extreme droughts such as those in central and western north America. The second synchronous period is the recent signal of the past ~100 years, which indicates a change to higher effective moisture that may be related to anthropogenic forcing on climate. This approach has the potential to fill regional gaps, where many previous paleo-lake depth methods (based on deeper centrally located cores) were relatively insensitive. By filling regional gaps, a better understanding of past spatial patterns in drought can be used to assess the sensitivity and realism of climate model projections of future climate change. This type of data is especially important for validating high spatial resolution, regional climate models.

TI  - Droplet digital PCR applied to environmental DNA, a promising method to estimate fish population abundance from humic-rich aquatic ecosystems
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Measures of environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations in water samples have the potential to be both a cost‐efficient and a nondestructive method to estimate fish population abundance. However, the inherent temporal and spatial variability in abiotic and biotic conditions in aquatic systems have been suggested to be a major obstacle to determine relationships between fish eDNA concentrations and fish population abundance. Moreover, once water samples are collected, methodological biases are common, which introduces additional sources of variation to potential relationships between eDNA concentrations and fish population abundance. Here, we evaluate the performance of applying the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to estimate fish population abundance in experimental enclosures. Using large‐scale enclosure ecosystems that contain populations of nine‐spined stickleback (<jats:italic>Pungitius pungitius</jats:italic>), we compared the concentrations of fish eDNA (COI mitochondrial region, 134 bp) obtained with the ddPCR method with high precision estimates of fish population abundance (i.e., number of individuals) and biomass. To evaluate the effects of contrasted concentrations of humic substances (potential PCR inhibitors) on the performance of ddPCR assays, we manipulated natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (range 4–11 mg/L) in the enclosures. Additionally, water temperature (+2°C) was manipulated in half of the enclosures. Results showed positive relationships between eDNA concentration and fish abundance and biomass estimates although unexplained variation remained. Still and importantly, fish eDNA estimates from high DOC enclosures were not lowered by potential inhibitory effects with our procedure. Finally, water temperature (although only 2°C difference) was neither detected as a significant factor influencing fish eDNA estimates. Altogether, our work highlights that ddPCR‐based eDNA is a promising method for future quantification of fish population abundance in natural systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Carbon budgets of boreal lakes: state of knowledge, challenges, and implications
PY  - 2015
AB  - Converging evidence suggests that freshwater systems play an important role in the carbon cycles at both regional and global scales. In addition, there are serious concerns that ongoing and future changes to the environment could alter these dynamics. This is particularly important in the boreal forest biome, which contains a very high density of lakes. In this review, we synthesize the current state of research to provide a critical overview of (i) the role of boreal lakes as emitters versus sinks of carbon, (ii) their contribution to the regional carbon balance, (iii) knowledge gaps that may inhibit an accurate evaluation of the role of boreal lakes in a landscape context, and (iv) impacts of environmental perturbations on carbon dynamics in boreal lakes. Several recent studies indicate that boreal lakes are actively processing, emitting, and storing carbon rather than being passive transport conduits. Yet, generalizing the role of lake ecosystems for the overall carbon balance of the boreal forest biom...

TI  - Centennial changes in water clarity of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea
PY  - 2013
AB  - Secchi depth is a valuable proxy for detecting long term changes in the water clarity of oceanic and coastal ecosystems. We analyse approximately 40 000 observations, which are available from ICES, from the Baltic Sea and the North Sea in the 20th century. Our results suggest pronounced effects of bottom depth and distance to coast on Secchi depth, and we account for this topographical effect in an assessment of the long term change in water clarity. Our results suggest a centennial Secchi depth shoaling of 3.2 � 0.2 and 5.8 � 0.6 m in areas that are shallower and deeper than 100 m in the Baltic Sea. For the North Sea the corresponding numbers were 1.8 � 0.3 and 5.2 � 0.9 m. We discuss potential ecosystem effects involving pronounced reductions in photic habitats and reduced visibility for visual predators. We suggest that the role of long term variations in colour dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on the transparency in the Baltic Sea and North Sea deserves future attention.

TI  - Terrestrial loads of dissolved organic matter drive inter-annual carbon flux in subtropical lakes during times of drought.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Lentic ecosystems are important agents of local and global carbon cycling, but their contribution varies along gradients of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and productivity. We investigated how contrasting summer and autumn precipitation can shape annual and inter-annual variation in ecosystem carbon (C) flux (gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and CO2 efflux) in two subtropical lakes differing substantially in trophic state and water color. Instrumented buoys recorded time series of free-water DO, terrestrial DOM (tDOM), chlorophyll a, water temperature profiles, and meteorological measurements over five years (2009–2011 and 2014–2015). Reduced precipitation caused immediate and prolonged effects on C flux in both lakes. During the drought year (2014) GPP and ER declined by 60 to 80% and both lakes were either CO2 sinks or neutral. In the subsequent wet year (2015), GPP and ER increased by 40 to 110%, and both lakes shifted to strong net CO2 emitters. Higher ecosystem R resulted from larger GPP while higher tDOM contributed to a dramatic increase in dissolved inorganic carbon, which intensified CO2 emission in both lakes. C flux was more responsive in the clear mesotrophic lake, declining by approximately 40% in the cumulative GPP and ER, and increasing by >400% in CO2 efflux whereas changes in the oligotrophic colored lake were more modest (approximately 30% and 300% for metabolic declines and efflux increases, respectively). Temporal variation and magnitude of C flux were governed by tDOM-mediated changes in epilimnetic nutrient levels and hypolimnetic light availability. This study demonstrated terrestrial loads of DOM strongly influence the inter-annual response and sensitivity of ecosystem C flux to variation in inter-annual precipitation. Our findings have important implications for predicting the trend, magnitude, duration, and sensitivity of the response of C flux in subtropical lakes/reservoirs to future changes in precipitation patterns under altered climatic conditions.

TI  - The response of North Atlantic diadromous fish to multiple stressors, including land use change: a multidecadal study
PY  - 2016
AB  - Reduction of freshwater habitat quality due to land use change can have major impacts on diadromous fish. Partitioning this impact from other potential drivers, such as changing marine conditions and climate, is hampered by a lack of long-term data sets. Here, four decades of data were used to assess the impact of land use change on Salmo salar and anadromous Salmo trutta in the Burrishoole catchment, Ireland, one of the few index sites for diadromous fish in the North Atlantic. Land use change was found to have no significant impact on the freshwater survival of either salmon or trout. However, climate impacted significantly on the survival of salmon and trout in fresh water, with poor survival in years with wetter, warmer winters, coinciding with positive North Atlantic Oscillation values. Additionally, cold springs were associated with higher survival in trout. The addition of hatchery fish into the salmon spawning cohort coincided with low freshwater survival. Our results highlight the necessity for a...

TI  - Effects of water level regulation in alpine hydropower reservoirs: an ecosystem perspective with a special emphasis on fish
PY  - 2017
AB  - Sustainable development of hydropower demands a holistic view of potential impacts of water level regulation (WLR) on reservoir ecosystems. Most environmental studies of hydropower have focused on rivers, whereas environmental effects of hydropower operations on reservoirs are less well understood. Here, we synthesize knowledge on how WLR from hydropower affects alpine lake ecosystems and highlight the fundamental factors that shape the environmental impacts of WLR. Our analysis of these impacts ranges from abiotic conditions to lower trophic levels and ultimately to fish. We conclude that the environmental effects are complex and case-specific and thus considering the operational regime of WLR (i.e. amplitude, timing, frequency, and rate of change) as well as the reservoir’s morphometry, geology and biotic community are prerequisites for any reliable predictions. Finally, we indicate promising avenues for future research and argue that recording and sharing of data, views and demands among different stakeholders, including operators, researchers and the public, is necessary for the sustainable development of hydropower in alpine lakes.

TI  - Terrestrial, benthic, and pelagic resource use in lakes: results from a three-isotope Bayesian mixing model
PY  - 2011
AB  - Fluxes of organic matter across habitat boundaries are common in food webs. These fluxes may strongly influence community dynamics, depending on the extent to which they are used by consumers. Yet understanding of basal resource use by consumers is limited, because describing trophic pathways in complex food webs is difficult. We quantified resource use for zooplankton, zoobenthos, and fishes in four low-productivity lakes, using a Bayesian mixing model and measurements of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. Multiple sources of uncertainty were explicitly incorporated into the model. As a result, posterior estimates of resource use were often broad distributions; nevertheless, clear patterns were evident. Zooplankton relied on terrestrial and pelagic primary production, while zoobenthos and fishes relied on terrestrial and benthic primary production. Across all consumer groups terrestrial reliance tended to be higher, and benthic reliance lower, in lakes where light penetration was low due to inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon. These results support and refine an emerging consensus that terrestrial and benthic support of lake food webs can be substantial, and they imply that changes in the relative availability of basal resources drive the strength of cross-habitat trophic connections.

TI  - Catchment-scale dissolved carbon concentrations and export estimates across six subarctic streams in northern Sweden
PY  - 2014
AB  - Climatic change is currently enhancing permafrost thawing and the flow of water through the landscape in sub- arctic and arctic catchments, with major consequences for the carbon export to aquatic ecosystems. We studied stream water carbon export in several tundra-dominated catchments in northern Sweden. There were clear seasonal differences in both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved in- organic carbon (DIC) concentrations. The highest DOC con- centrations occurred during the spring freshet while the high- est DIC concentrations were always observed during winter baseflow conditions for the six catchments considered in this study. Long-term trends for the period 1982 to 2010 for one of the streams showed that DIC concentrations has increased by 9 % during the 28 yr of measurement while no clear trend was found for DOC. Similar increasing trends were also found for conductivity, Ca and Mg. When trends were dis- cretized into individual months, we found a significant lin- ear increase in DIC concentrations with time for September, November and December. In these subarctic catchments, the annual mass of C exported as DIC was in the same order of magnitude as DOC; the average proportion of DIC to the total dissolved C exported was 61 % for the six streams. Fur- thermore, there was a direct relationship between total runoff and annual dissolved carbon fluxes for these six catchments. These relationships were more prevalent for annual DIC ex- ports than annual DOC exports in this region. Our results also highlight that both DOC and DIC can be important in high- latitude ecosystems. This is particularly relevant in environ- ments where thawing permafrost and changes to subsurface ice due to global warming can influence stream water fluxes of C. The large proportion of stream water DIC flux also has implications on regional C budgets and needs to be consid- ered in order to understand climate-induced feedback mech- anisms across the landscape.

TI  - Do experimental conditions bias plankton responses to increased concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM)? A meta-analytical synthesis of the published results.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems has manifold direct and indirect consequences for primary and secondary production. Theoretical approaches suggest a negative effect of DOM on phytoplankton and a positive effect on bacteria, both of which alter the development of metazooplankton, the main consumer of bacteria and phytoplankton. However, experimental observations give heterogeneous results on the effect sizes of plankton in relation to DOM addition. Here, the synthesis of 411 effect sizes of plankton in response to DOM is presented from 59 studies. The referenced studies display effect sizes in relation to various DOM sources and different experimental designs. Thus, the hypothesis that neither DOM quality nor the type of experiment bias the effect size response of plankton was tested; the hypothesis was tested separately for bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and metazooplankton with the use of a meta-analytical approach. DOM quality was represented by the five different sources of DOM that are used most often in these experiments, i.e., natural water, bog leachate, glucose/sucrose, terrestrial plant leachate, and soil leachate. The experiment types comprised in situ experiments, i.e., experiments taking place under manipulated conditions in a natural ecosystem, and ex situ experiments, i.e., those taking place outside of a natural ecosystem. The meta-analyses showed that, although total DOM had a positive influence on the effect size of bacterioplankton and an insignificant influence on metazooplankton, the effect sizes differed significantly in relation to DOM source and the type of experiment. The effect size of phytoplankton, although not significantly related with total DOM, differed in response to DOM source but not experiment type. The results suggest that experimental conditions may produce artifacts in the strength of responses of aquatic biota to DOM concentrations.

TI  - The importance of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as high-quality food in freshwater ecosystems with implications of global change.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Traditionally, trophic ecology research on aquatic ecosystems has focused more on the quantity of dietary energy flow within food webs rather than food quality and its effects on organisms at various trophic levels. Recent studies emphasize that food quality is central to consumer growth and reproduction, and the importance of food quality for aquatic ecosystems has become increasingly well recognized. It is timely to synthesise these findings and identify potential future research directions. We conducted a systematic review of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-PUFAs) as a crucial component of high-quality food sources in freshwater ecosystems to evaluate their impact on a variety of consumers, and explore the effects of global change on these high-quality food sources and their transfer to higher trophic consumers within and across ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems, algae rich in ω3 long-chain PUFAs, such as diatoms, dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, represent important high-quality food sources for consumers, whereas cyanobacteria, green algae, terrestrial vascular plants and macrophytes low in ω3 long-chain PUFAs are low-quality food sources. High-quality ω3-PUFA-containing food sources usually lead to increased growth and reproduction of aquatic consumers, e.g. benthic invertebrates, zooplankton and fish, and also provide ω3 long-chain PUFAs to riparian terrestrial consumers via emergent aquatic insects. Consumers feeding on high-quality ω3-PUFA-containing foods in turn represent high-quality food for their own predators. However, the ω3-PUFA content of food sources is sensitive to global environmental changes. Warming, eutrophication, increased light intensity (e.g. from loss of riparian shading), and pollutants potentially inhibit the synthesis of algal ω3-PUFAs while at the same time promoting the growth of lower-quality foods, such as cyanobacteria and green algae. These factors combined could lead to a significant reduction in the availability of ω3-PUFAs for consumers and constrain their overall fitness. Although the effect of individual environmental factors on high-quality ω3-PUFA-containing food sources has been investigated, multiple environmental factors (e.g. climate change, human activities, pollution) will act in combination and any synergistic effects on aquatic food webs remain unclear. Identifying the sources and fate of ω3-PUFAs within and across ecosystems could represent an important approach to understand the impact of multiple environmental factors on trophic relationships and the implications for populations of freshwater and riparian consumers. Maintaining the availability of high-quality ω3-PUFA-containing food sources may also be key to mitigating freshwater biodiversity loss due to global change.

TI  - Simulating the effects of regulation measures on ecosystem state changes in a shallow lake
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Ecosystem state changes are actively engaged in the theory and practice of shallow lake restoration and management. Previous research focus on the occurrence and driving mechanisms of abrupt state shifts (regime shifts). However, the regulation effects of potential measures on the process of ecosystem state changes remain relatively unknown. The study employed a mechanism-driven, mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of ecosystem state changes in a shallow lake. Parameters for building regulatory scenarios were selected from the parameter sensitivity analysis outcomes. The convenience of use of the measures in real lake management was taken into consideration. Finally, regulation effects on the process of ecosystem state changes have been analyzed with scenarios. Lake Baiyangdian in north China plain was taken as a case study for this research. Results demonstrated that the process of ecosystem state changes could be regulated by reducing total phosphorous concentration in incoming water (inflows). The ecosystem will have better performance toward the clear state when reducing total phosphorous concentration in inflows below 0.23 g m−3. The ecosystem will experience periodical oscillation of states within a narrow range of vegetation coverage once total phosphorus concentration in inflows is reduced to 0.18 g m−3.

TI  - Whole-genome sequencing illuminates multifaceted targets of selection to humic substances in Eurasian perch.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Extreme environments are inhospitable to the majority of species, but some organisms are able to survive in such hostile conditions due to evolutionary adaptations. For example, modern bony fishes have colonized various aquatic environments, including perpetually dark, hypoxic, hypersaline and toxic habitats. Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) is among the few fish species of northern latitudes that is able to live in very acidic humic lakes. Such lakes represent almost "nocturnal" environments; they contain high levels of dissolved organic matter, which in addition to creating a challenging visual environment, also affects a large number of other habitat parameters and biotic interactions. To reveal the genomic targets of humic-associated selection, we performed whole-genome sequencing of perch originating from 16 humic and 16 clear-water lakes in northern Europe. We identified over 800,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which >10,000 were identified as potential candidates under selection (associated with >3000 genes) using multiple outlier approaches. Our findings suggest that adaptation to the humic environment may involve hundreds of regions scattered across the genome. Putative signals of adaptation were detected in genes and gene families with diverse functions, including organism development and ion transportation. The observed excess of variants under selection in regulatory regions highlights the importance of adaptive evolution via regulatory elements, rather than via protein sequence modification. Our study demonstrates the power of whole-genome analysis to illuminate the multifaceted nature of humic adaptation and provides the foundation for further investigation of causal mutations underlying phenotypic traits of ecological and evolutionary importance.

TI  - Compositional variations in algal organic matter during distinct growth phases in karst water
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Inland surface water plays an important role in global carbon cycling, which responds to transformation between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Studies have shown that algae in karst lakes and reservoirs can convert DIC to organic matter (OM) and form stable carbon sinks <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> photosynthesis. However, the pathways of conversion of inorganic carbon to organic carbon during algal growth remain unclear and need further investigation. In this study, spectroscopic techniques were applied to investigate the variations in algal organic matter (AOM) composition in the growth metabolism of <jats:italic>Chlorella vulgaris</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Scenedesmus obliquus</jats:italic> under simulated karst water condition. The results showed that algal extracellular organic matter (EOM) contained high DIC concentration during the adaptation phase, which formed the carbon source for algal photosynthesis. In addition, DOC in algae increased after entering the stationary phase, while more OM was released into water. As algal growth proceeded, the amino groups in EOM were consumed to produce more aromatic protein-like material, while more lipid material was produced in intracellular organic matter (IOM). The spectral characterization results could intuitively determine AOM dynamics in different growth stages of algae, which can be used for establishing effective approaches for detecting organic carbon variations and responding to regional carbon cycling in karst water.</jats:p>

TI  - Interactive effects of N:P ratios and light on nitrogen-fixer abundance.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nitrogen-fixers can contribute significant amounts of nitrogen (N) and impact ecosystem functioning in diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. What determines N-fixer abundance still remains poorly understood. Here we experimentally investigate major environmental controls on the abundance of N-fixers: nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio and light. We grew a N-fixer, cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae, in a multispecies community of freshwater phytoplankton in replicated factorial design treatments with two N:P ratios and two light levels. We show that low N:P ratios promote the dominance of the N-fixer in the community, but only under high light. Under low light, N:P ratio did not have a significant effect on the abundance of the N-fixer. N fixation occurred at low N:P only and increased with increasing light. In contrast, the density of non N-fixing cyanobacteria did not depend on N:P ratios. Green algae dominated under high N:P and high light only, exhibiting the opposite pattern of dominance to N-fixers. These results are consistent with patterns observed in nature and help explain the N-fixer distribution along the environmental gradients of nutrients and light.

TI  - Seasonal-Spatial Distribution and Long-Term Variation of Transparency in Xin’anjiang Reservoir: Implications for Reservoir Management
PY  - 2015
AB  - Water transparency is a useful indicator of water quality or productivity and is widely used to detect long-term changes in the water quality and eutrophication of lake ecosystems. Based on short-term spatial observations in the spring, summer, and winter and on long-term site-specific observation from 1988 to 2013, the spatial, seasonal, long-term variations, and the factors affecting transparency are presented for Xin’anjiang Reservoir (China). Spatially, transparency was high in the open water but low in the bays and the inflowing river mouths, reflecting the effect of river runoff. The seasonal effects were distinct, with lower values in the summer than in the winter, most likely due to river runoff and phytoplankton biomass increases. The transparency decreased significantly with a linear slope of 0.079 m/year, indicating a 2.05 m decrease and a marked decrease in water quality. A marked increase occurred in chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration, and a significant correlation was found between the transparency and Chla concentration, indicating that phytoplankton biomass can partially explain the long-term trend of transparency in Xin’anjiang Reservoir. The river input and phytoplankton biomass increase were associated with soil erosion and nutrient loss in the catchment. Our study will support future management of water quality in Xin’anjiang Reservoir.

TI  - CDOM variations in Finnish lakes and rivers between 1913 and 2014.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract In lakes and rivers, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are closely related. We analysed three large spectrophotometer data sets of Finnish inland waters from the years 1913–1914, 1913–1931 and 2014 for long-term changes in optical properties. The first data set consists of absorption spectra in the band 467–709 nm of 212 filtered water samples, the second one contains 11–19 years of data for seven rivers, and the third one contains 153 sites with high resolution spectra over the band 200–750 nm. These data sets were supplemented with more recent monitoring data of DOC. The sites represent typical optical inland water types of north-eastern Europe. The results did not show any consistent large-scale changes in CDOM concentrations over the 101-year time period. The statistics of the absorption coefficients in 1913 and 2014 were almost identical, at 467 nm they were 1.9 ± 1.0 m− 1 in 1913 and 1.7 ± 1.2 m− 1 in 2014, and the shape of the CDOM absorption spectrum was unchanged, proportional to exp(–S·λ), S = 0.011 nm− 1 and λ is wavelength. Catchment properties, primarily lake and peat-land percentages, explained 50% of the variation of CDOM concentration in the lakes, and hydrological conditions explained 50% of the variation of CDOM in the rivers. Both illustrate the importance of catchments and hydrology to CDOM concentrations of boreal inland waters.

TI  - Functionally reversible impacts of disturbances on lake food webs linked to spatial and seasonal dependencies.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Increasing human impact on the environment is causing drastic changes in disturbance regimes and how they prevail over time. Of increasing relevance is to further our understanding on biological responses to pulse disturbances (short duration) and how they interact with other ongoing press disturbances (constantly present). Because the temporal and spatial contexts of single experiments often limit our ability to generalize results across space and time, we conducted a modularized mesocosm experiment replicated in space (five lakes along a latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia) and time (two seasons, spring and summer) to generate general predictions on how the functioning and composition of multitrophic plankton communities (zoo-, phyto- and bacterioplankton) respond to pulse disturbances acting either in isolation or combined with press disturbances. As pulse disturbance, we used short-term changes in fish presence, and as press disturbance, we addressed the ongoing reduction in light availability caused by increased cloudiness and lake browning in many boreal and subarctic lakes. First, our results show that the top-down pulse disturbance had the strongest effects on both functioning and composition of the three trophic levels across sites and seasons, with signs for interactive impacts with the bottom-up press disturbance on phytoplankton communities. Second, community composition responses to disturbances were highly divergent between lakes and seasons: temporal accumulated community turnover of the same trophic level either increased (destabilization) or decreased (stabilization) in response to the disturbances compared to control conditions. Third, we found functional recovery from the pulse disturbances to be frequent at the end of most experiments. In a broader context, these results demonstrate that top-down, pulse disturbances, either alone or with additional constant stress upon primary producers caused by bottom-up disturbances, can induce profound but often functionally reversible changes across multiple trophic levels, which are strongly linked to spatial and temporal context dependencies. Furthermore, the identified dichotomy of disturbance effects on the turnover in community composition demonstrates the potential of disturbances to either stabilize or destabilize biodiversity patterns over time across a wide range of environmental conditions.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in natural bog pools and those created by rewetting schemes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Anthropogenic drainage and cutting over of peatlands have historically occurred worldwide leading to erosion, issues with water quality, loss of biodiversity, and reduced rates of carbon accumulation. In recent years, rewetting measures have attempted to address these issues. Creating dams to block drainage ditches on peatlands is a common restoration tool, yet the ecological consequences of such management interventions are poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about the ecology of the thousands of pools created by drain blocking is limited even though they potentially provide valuable new habitat for aquatic species and food and water sources for terrestrial organisms. More research is needed to assess the suitability of these artificial pools as surrogates for naturally occurring peat pools with regard to the flora (e.g., bryophytes, algae, and macrophytes) and fauna (e.g., invertebrates and amphibians), which utilize them. Evidence suggests that (1) to maximize benefits to aquatic biota, land managers should consider creating an array of differently sized pools behind the dams as a broader size range would facilitate colonization by a wider range of taxa, (2) prioritizing landscapes close to existing water bodies would encourage faster colonization, and (3) even newly created pools with low macrophyte cover may be able to sustain substantial populations of larger fauna via algal primary production, consumption of detritus, and microbial processing of humic substances and methane. Ongoing programs of peatland restoration worldwide also afford unique opportunities to study how pool communities assemble and change over time.

TI  - Wind drives fast changes of light climate in a large, shallow re-established lake.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract With ever greater frequency, wetlands and shallow lakes that had been diverted for agriculture are being re-established to reduce nutrient loss and greenhouse gas emission, as well as to increase biodiversity. Here, we investigate drivers of water column light attenuation (Kd) at multiple time scales and locations in Lake Fil, Denmark, during the first five years after its re-establishment in 2012. We found that Kd was generally high (overall mean: 3.4 m−1), with resuspended sediment particles and colored dissolved organic matter being the main contributors. Using daily time series of light attenuation recorded at four stations, we used a generalized additive model to analyze the influence of wind speed and direction on Kd. This model explained a high proportion of the variation (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.74 m−1, and MAE = 0.55 m−1) and showed that higher wind speed increased Kd on the same day and, with smaller influence, on the next day. Furthermore, we found a significant influence of wind direction and an interaction between wind speed and wind direction, a combination that suggests that short-term variations in light climate depends on the interplay between wind direction and sources of particles. Wind from non-prevailing directions thus influence Kd more, as it can activate previously deposited particles. The maximum colonization depths of submerged vegetation occurred at ~2–6% of sub-surface light from 2014 to 2016 and peaked at 1.2 m in 2016. The fast, day-to-day variation of Kd in Lake Fil reveals the importance of wind on light climate and in turn biological elements such as phytoplankton and submerged macrophyte development in shallow lakes. The implications are essential for the prior planning and management of future lake re-establishment.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter modulates the impact of herbicides on a freshwater alga: a laboratory study of a three-way interaction
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract In freshwater environments, microorganisms such as microalgae are influenced by the concentrations of dissolved chemicals but can modify the fate of these substances by biosorption, accumulation and even metabolization. In this laboratory study, we assessed the growth and physiology of non-axenic cultures of the chlorophyte Sphaerellopsis sp. exposed to environmental concentrations of diuron, irgarol and S-metolachlor (0.5, 0.5 and 5 μg·L−1, respectively) singly and in mixture, in the presence or absence of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). The growth, photosynthetic efficiency and relative intracellular lipid content of Sphaerellopsis sp., as were measured after 14 days of exposure, as were the concentrations of bacteria in the cultures. DOM absorbance and fluorescence, and concentrations of the herbicides and their metabolites in the culture medium were also recorded. The growth of Sphaerellopsis sp. was very low in the absence of DOM but dramatically enhanced in treatments where DOM was added. As a result, the toxicity of the herbicides observed in treatments without DOM was overcome in those where DOM was added. The chemical characteristics of DOM were modified by the microalgae, and the fate of the herbicides was affected by the interaction between microorganisms (both bacteria and algae) and the DOM. Herbicide concentrations decreased over time, with a simultaneous increase in some of their metabolites, suggesting a biological degradation in the presence of DOM.

TI  - Brownification increases winter mortality in fish.
PY  - 2016
AB  - In northern climates, winter is a bottleneck for many organisms. Low light and resource availability constrains individual foraging rates, potentially leading to starvation and increased mortality. Increasing input of humic substances to aquatic ecosystems causes brownification of water and hence a further decrease of light availability, which may lead to further decreased foraging rates and starvation mortality during winter. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of experimentally increased humic water input on consumption and survival of young-of-the-year three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over winter in large outdoor enclosures. Population densities were estimated in autumn, and the following spring and food availability and consumption were monitored over winter. As hypothesized, mortality was higher under humic (76%) as compared to ambient conditions (64%). In addition, body condition and ingested prey biomass were lower under humic conditions, even though resource availability was not lower under humic conditions. Light conditions were significantly poorer under humic conditions. This suggests that increased mortality and decreased body condition and ingested prey biomass were not due to decreased resource availability but due to decreased search efficiency in this visual feeding consumer. Increased future brownification of aquatic systems may, therefore, negatively affect both recruitment and densities of fish.

TI  - Exploring the suitability of ecosystem metabolomes to assess imprints of brownification and nutrient enrichment on lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Loadings of colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) and nutrients affect lake ecosystem functioning in opposite ways, rendering assessments of combined effects challenging. We used the “ecosystem metabolome” as a conceptual framework to overcome this problem by characterizing the chemically diverse pool of DOM in lakes. The underlying rationale is that the diversity of dissolved metabolites bears the legacy of allochthonous inputs, autochthonous primary production, and a wealth of organic matter transformations resulting from microbial or photodegradation. Our objective was to assess whether high‐resolution mass‐spectrometric analyses can unlock that information on DOM origin and transformation pathways as well as environmental drivers imprinting the lake ecosystem metabolome. We performed a large‐scale enclosure experiment to assess the influences of brownification and nutrient enrichment on the composition and diversity of DOM, and a complementary bottle incubation to isolate the effect of photodegradation. For validation, we assessed whether the same patterns emerge from published observational data from 109 Swedish lakes. Ultra‐high‐resolution mass spectrometry distinguished ∼3000 metabolites in solid‐phase extracts of lake water. Network analysis revealed five metabolite clusters that could be related to different source processes based on molecular weight, position in van Krevelen diagrams and assignment to molecular categories (peptides, lipids, etc.). Emergent DOM properties such as molecular diversity provided insights into the processes generating each of the five DOM clusters. Overall, our data suggest that the thousands of molecular formulas comprising ecosystem metabolomes of lakes arise from few major processes and reflect imprints of environmental drivers such as brownification and nutrient enrichment.</jats:p>

TI  - Effects of light and substrate on the benthic diatoms in an oligotrophic lake: a comparison between natural and artificial substrates
PY  - 2012
AB  - Benthic diatoms form a particularly important community in oligotrophic lakes, but factors influencing their distribution are not well known. This study reports the depth distribution of living motile and total diatoms (living plus dead diatoms) on both natural (from sand to fine organic mud) and artificial substrates in an oligotrophic lake. On artificial substrates, motile diatom densities peaked in abundance (24-30 cells · mm(-2) ) between 0.6 and 1.9 m depth; on natural sediment surfaces, motile diatoms were generally more numerous and peaked in abundance (925 cells · mm(-2) ) at 1.3 m depth. Total diatom densities on artificial substrates were highest (1260 valves · mm(-2) ) at 0.6 m depth, with very low values below 3 m depth; on natural sediment surfaces, total diatom abundances were generally much higher (21600 valves · mm(-2) ) at 3 m depth and declined gradually with depth. Significant relationships were found between light and diatom densities on the artificial substrate. Ordination analysis indicated that substrate type significantly correlated with the variation of diatom composition on artificial and natural substrates. Our results suggest that in oligotrophic lakes, light influences benthic diatom abundance, whereas substrate type has more influence on benthic diatom composition.

TI  - Diatom response to mid-Holocene climate in three small Arctic lakes in northernmost Finnmark
PY  - 2015
AB  - Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from lake sediment biological records can be challenging, due to variation in non-climatic factors, which alter ecosystem responses. To consider this, it is important to replicate a study regionally, so as to gain information on spatial variability of ecosystem response and the influence of site-specific conditions. Previous pollen-based palaeoclimatic records from three well-dated Arctic lake sites highlight the response of regional Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forest-tundra transition to Holocene climatic variability, and suggest the northernmost Peninsulas of Finnmark to be climatically sensitive. This study analysed dated sediment sequences between c. 3,970 and c. 6,200 cal. yr BP from these three previously published shallow lakes: LitenCappesjavri (LCJ); over Gunnarsfjorden (OGF); and over Kobbkrokvatnet (OKV), for freshwater diatoms. Diatom assemblages showed an increase in the planktonic diatoms relative to benthic diatoms, with an onset towards higher abundances of small centric planktonic diatoms at OGF (between c. 5,270 and 5,350 cal. yr BP) and OKV (between c. 5,280 and 5,350 cal. yr BP). Additionally, a diatom compositional shift was detected at LCJ between c. 5,180 and 5,300 cal. yr BP. Trend analysis found the main diatom compositional change at all three sites to occur at 5,300 cal. yr BP. However, this synchronous diatom shift during the midHolocene varies in magnitude within the three Finnmark lakes. The abrupt planktonic:benthic diatom ratio changes are independent of the Pinus:Betula ratios, and are likely to be a result of lake ice-cover changes, allowing longer growing seasons, greater water column stability, and higher nutrient concentrations from surrounding catchments. This study highlights the significant differences in aquatic ecosystem and terrestrial vegetation response to climatic changes, with diatom assemblages at these sites either responding before the regional tree-line shift or to a separate climatic event within the mid-Holocene.

TI  - Trade-offs Between Light and Nutrient Availability Across Gradients of Dissolved Organic Carbon Lead to Spatially and Temporally Variable Responses of Lake Phytoplankton Biomass to Browning
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Northern lakes are experiencing widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that are likely to lead to changes in pelagic phytoplankton biomass. Pelagic phytoplankton biomass responds to trade-offs between light and nutrient availability. However, the influence of DOC light absorbing properties and carbon–nutrient stoichiometry on phytoplankton biomass across seasonal or spatial gradients has not been assessed. Here, we analyzed data from almost 5000 lakes to examine how the carbon–phytoplankton biomass relationship is influenced by seasonal changes in light availability, DOC light absorbing properties (carbon-specific visual absorbance, SVA<jats:sub>420</jats:sub>), and DOC–nutrient [total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)] stoichiometry, using TOC as a proxy for DOC. We found evidence for trade-offs between light and nutrient availability in the relationship between DOC and phytoplankton biomass [chlorophyll (chl)-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>], with the shape of the relationship varying with season. A clear unimodal relationship was found only in the fall, particularly in the subsets of lakes with the highest TOC:TP. Observed trends of increasing TOC:TP and decreasing TOC:TN suggest that the effects of future browning will be contingent on future changes in carbon–nutrient stoichiometry. If browning continues, phytoplankton biomass will likely increase in most northern lakes, with increases of up to 76% for a 1.7 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>increase in DOC expected in subarctic regions, where DOC, SVA<jats:sub>420</jats:sub>, DOC:TN, and DOC:TP are all low. In boreal regions with higher DOC and higher SVA<jats:sub>420</jats:sub>, and thus lower light availability, lakes may experience only moderate increases or even decreases in phytoplankton biomass with future browning.</jats:p>

TI  - Primary producers or consumers? Increasing phytoplankton bacterivory along a gradient of lake warming and browning
PY  - 2017
AB  - Eukaryotic phytoplankton form the basis of aquatic food webs and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Many of these evolutionarily diverse microalgae are also capable of feeding on other microbes, and hence simultaneously act both as primary producers and consumers. The net ecosystem impact of such mixotrophs depends on their nutritional strategy which is likely to alter with environmental change. Many temperate lakes are currently warming at unprecedented rates and are simultaneously increasing in water color (browning) due to increased run-off of humic substances. We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in light intensity and increased bacterial abundances would favor mixotrophic phytoplankton over obligate autotrophs, while higher temperatures might boost their rates of bacterivory. We tested these hypotheses in a mesocosm experiment simulating a gradient of increasing temperature and water color in temperate shallow lakes as expected to occur over the coming century. Mixotrophs showed a faster increase in abundance under the climate change scenario during spring, when they dominated the phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both bacterial abundances and rates of phytoplankton bacterivory increased under future climate conditions. Bacterivory contributed significantly to phytoplankton resource acquisition under future climate conditions, while remaining negligible throughout most of the season in treatments resembling today's conditions. Hence, to our knowledge, we here provide the first evidence for an increasing importance of bacterivory by phytoplankton in future temperate shallow lakes. Such a change in phytoplankton nutritional strategies will likely impact biogeochemical cycles and highlights the need to conceptually integrate mixotrophy into current ecosystem models.

TI  - Lowered nutritional quality of plankton caused by global environmental changes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Global environmental changes are causing widespread nutrient depletion, declines in the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) to total phosphorus (DIN:TP), and increases in both water temperature and terrestrial colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (browning) in high-latitude northern lakes. Declining lake DIN:TP, warming, and browning alter the nutrient limitation regime and biomass of phytoplankton, but how these stressors together affect the nutritional quality in terms of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents of the pelagic food web components remains unknown. We assessed the fatty acid compositions of seston and zooplankton in 33 lakes across south-to-north and boreal-to-subarctic gradients in Sweden. Data showed higher lake DIN:TP in the south than in the north, and that boreal lakes were warmer and browner than subarctic lakes. Lake DIN:TP strongly affected the PUFA contents-especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-in seston, calanoids, and copepods (as a group), but not in cladocerans. The EPA+DHA contents increased by 123% in seston, 197% in calanoids, and 230% in copepods across a lake molar DIN:TP gradient from 0.17 to 14.53, indicating lower seston and copepod nutritional quality in the more N-limited lakes (those with lower DIN:TP). Water temperature affected EPA+DHA contents of zooplankton, especially cladocerans, but not seston. Cladoceran EPA+DHA contents were reduced by ca. 6% for every 1 degrees C increase in surface water. Also, the EPA, DHA, or EPA+DHA contents of Bosmina, cyclopoids, and copepods increased in lakes with higher DOC concentrations or aromaticity. Our findings indicate that zooplankton food quality for higher consumers will decrease with warming alone (for cladocerans) or in combination with declining lake DIN:TP (for copepods), but impacts of these stressors are moderated by lake browning. Global environmental changes that drive northern lakes toward more N-limited, warmer, and browner conditions will reduce PUFA availability and nutritional quality of the pelagic food web components.

TI  - Drivers of metabolism and net heterotrophy in contrasting lakes
PY  - 2010
AB  - We investigated the influence of light, nutrients, and organic matter on gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP 5 GPP 2 R) in a dystrophic forest lake and an open eutrophic lake. Forest vegetation reduced incoming irradiance (20%) and wind speed (34%) in dystrophic Gribso, having thermal stratification 1 month longer than in eutrophic Slotsso. While Gribso had nutrient-limited phytoplankton during most of the year, Slotsso only experienced nutrient depletion during algal blooms. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbed most light (average 82%) in dystrophic Gribso, while phytoplankton and other particles absorbed most light (45%) in eutrophic Slotsso. GPP and NEP were positively related to irradiance in both lakes. However, because of higher CDOM absorbance, three times more light was needed to attain autotrophy in Gribso, being net heterotrophic (NEP , 0) for 79% of all days, compared to 59% in Slotsso. This difference vanished when NEP was scaled to light absorption by pigments, although the eutrophic lake maintained a higher photon yield. Metabolic rates varied much more in Slotsso, where higher light and nutrient availability facilitated occasional phytoplankton blooms, while low light and nutrient availability in Gribso dampened temporal variability. Both lakes were annually net heterotrophic with similar annual areal rates (NEP, 214 mol C m22). Net heterotrophy in dystrophic Gribso derives from high import of organic carbon-rich water, while heterotrophy in eutrophic Slotsso is fueled by degradation of sediment pools of organic matter accumulated under previous hypereutrophic conditions, emphasizing the importance of lake history on the contemporary metabolic state.

TI  - Invertebrates are declining in boreal aquatic habitat: The effect of brownification?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Surface water browning affects boreal lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. This process is expected to increase with global warming. Boreal lakes are the most numerous lakes on Earth. These ecosystems are particularly sensitive to disturbances due to their low biodiversity compared to other aquatic environments. The recent darkening of surface water is expected to hinder key ecosystem processes, particularly through lower primary productivity and loss of biodiversity. However, studies based on long-term data collections have rarely been conducted on the ecological consequences of water browning on aquatic food webs, especially concerning its impacts on invertebrate communities. For the first time, our analysis based on two decades of data collection in Finnish lakes highlighted a relation between water browning and a decline in aquatic macroinvertebrate abundances. Aquatic invertebrates are the main food resource for many secondary predators such as fish and waterbirds, hence such effect on their populations may have major consequences for boreal ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Boreal Lakes: High Spatial and Inter-annual Variability Controlled by Landscape Attributes and Wet-dry Periods
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Concentration and chemical composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence several lake functions; greenhouse gas exchange, nutrient cycling, food webs, and water treatability. To assess spatial and inter‐annual controls on DOC characteristics, 34 lakes were sampled annually for 8 years on the Boreal Plains, Western Canada—a region with heterogeneous surficial geology, and a sub‐humid climate with pronounced inter‐annual wet‐dry periods. Large spatial variability in long‐term average DOC concentration (10–49 mg C L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and aromaticity (SUVA<jats:sub>254</jats:sub>: 1.2–3.9 L mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> C m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) among lakes was found. Higher DOC concentrations and aromaticity were associated with lakes in watersheds with fine‐textured surficial geology and with relatively large contributions through shallow, organic‐rich flow paths. Lake DOC aromaticity was also higher in lakes with lower evaporative enrichment, regardless of surficial geology, indicating shorter lake water residence times and less within‐lake degradation of allochthonous DOC. High inter‐annual variability for both DOC and aromaticity was observed, with coefficients of variation at 10.9 ± 4.6% and 11.1 ± 2.5% among lakes, respectively. Inter‐annual variability in DOC concentrations had low synchronicity among lakes, with patterns of variability linked to surficial geology and primarily responsive to short‐term cumulative precipitation. Conversely, inter‐annual variability in aromaticity had high synchronicity among lakes, driven by longer‐term cumulative precipitation and shifts in lake water residence times. Our study shows it is necessary to consider lake hydrogeomorphic setting and climate to understand spatial and inter‐annual variability in lake DOC characteristics and associated lake functions, and that Boreal Plains lakes have high climate sensitivity.</jats:p>

TI  - Advances on Water Quality Detection by UV-Vis Spectroscopy
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water resources are closely linked to human productivity and life. Owing to the deteriorating water resources environment, accurate and rapid determination of the main water quality parameters has become a current research hotspot. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy offers an effective tool for qualitative analysis and quantitative detection of contaminants in a water environment. In this review, the principle and application of UV-Vis technology in water quality detection were studied. The principle of UV-Vis spectroscopy for detecting water quality parameters and the method of modeling and analysis of spectral data were presented. Various UV-Vis technologies for water quality detection were reviewed according to the types of pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand, heavy metal ions, nitrate nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon. Finally, the future development of UV-Vis spectroscopy for the determination of water quality was discussed.

TI  - Methane in Lakes: Variability in Stable Carbon Isotopic Composition and the Potential Importance of Groundwater Input
PY  - 2021
AB  - Methane (CH4) is an important component of the carbon (C) cycling in lakes. CH4 production enables carbon in sediments to be either reintroduced to the food web via CH4 oxidation or emitted as a greenhouse gas making lakes one of the largest natural sources of atmospheric CH4. Large stable carbon isotopic fractionation during CH4 oxidation makes changes in 13C:12C ratio (δ13C) a powerful and widely used tool to determine the extent to which lake CH4 is oxidized, rather than emitted. This relies on correct δ13C values of original CH4 sources, the variability of which has rarely been investigated systematically in lakes. In this study, we measured δ13C in CH4 bubbles in littoral sediments and in CH4 dissolved in the anoxic hypolimnion of six boreal lakes with different characteristics. The results indicate that δ13C of CH4 sources is consistently higher (less 13C depletion) in littoral sediments than in deep waters across boreal and subarctic lakes. Variability in organic matter substrates across depths is a potential explanation. In one of the studied lakes available data from nearby soils showed correspondence between δ13C-CH4 in groundwater and deep lake water, and input from the catchment of CH4 via groundwater exceeded atmospheric CH4 emissions tenfold over a period of one month. It indicates that lateral hydrological transport of CH4 can explain the observed δ13C-CH4 patterns and be important for lake CH4 cycling. Our results have important consequences for modelling and process assessments relative to lake CH4 using δ13C, including for CH4 oxidation, which is a key regulator of lake CH4 emissions.

TI  - The potential of remote sensing in ecological status assessment of coloured lakes using aquatic plants
PY  - 2014
AB  - Field-based survey methods for aquatic vegetation have been identified as resource-demanding. Recent advances in remote sensing (RS) with sub-decimetre resolution allow for surveying aquatic vegetation at the species level. Coloured lakes, mainly due to high concentrations of humic substances, are globally widespread. However, high colour impedes the identification of submerged vegetation via remote sensing. Here, we evaluate the potential of using only emergent, floating and floating-leaved taxa that are detectable by high-resolution RS (RS-taxa) to assess the ecological status of lakes. In a dataset covering 72 Swedish low alkaline coloured lakes, we identified 31 RS-taxa. The power of RS-taxa assemblages to predict non-RS assemblages was analysed by a combination of ordination (Detrended Correspondence Analysis, DCA, and Redundancy Analysis) and multiple regression analysis. We compared the performance of a trophic metric score based on RS-taxa with that based on field data from all taxa along different environmental gradients. Forty percent of the variability of the first non-RS taxa DCA-axis was predicted by the DCA-results based on RS-taxa. Correlations of the trophic metric score and total nitrogen concentrations were equally strong for the dataset based on RS-taxa compared to the dataset based on all taxa. For total phosphorous concentrations, the correlation was stronger for the dataset based on all taxa, but for a complex water quality gradient (including sulphate, N-species, chlorophyll and percent cover of wetlands in the riparian buffer) the correlation was higher for the RS-taxa dataset. The significant linkage between the two community fractions (remotely-sensible and non-sensible) revealed considerable assemblage concordance, suggesting a notable potential of the use of remote sensing in lake macrophyte monitoring. The established trophic metric score seems most qualified for surveillance monitoring that, in combination with the eased efforts of data acquisition, detects long-term changes of the aquatic environment caused by shifts in climate, land use and (related) eutrophication.

TI  - Phytoplankton Sensitivity to Heavy Metals in Baltic Coastal Lakes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - This study aimed to compare concentrations of chlorophyll-a between individual phytoplankton groups for four shallow Baltic coastal lakes, varying in type of connection with the sea. For two years, the research focused on quantifying the effects of abiotic factors-concentrations of heavy metals (Ba, Bi, Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and hydrological connectivity-on phytoplankton composition, biomass, and photosynthetic activity. Our results show that hydrological factors are the main predictors of phytoplankton structure. The lakes differed in salinity: freshwater vs. brackish vs. transitional lakes. Irrespective of lake type, the dominant group was that of Cyanobacteria (~80%), but their percentage contribution was lower in the brackish lake. Baltic seawater intrusion resulted in a decrease in heavy-metal concentrations in lake water for Fe, Zn, Pb, and Bi. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested positive effects of some heavy metals on the biomass of the Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. For the Cryptophyta only, a slight decrease in biomass was linked with increased metal concentrations in open water.

TI  - Forests fuel fish growth in freshwater deltas
PY  - 2014
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are fuelled by biogeochemical inputs from surrounding lands and within-lake primary production. Disturbances that change these inputs may affect how aquatic ecosystems function and deliver services vital to humans. Here we test, using a forest cover gradient across eight separate catchments, whether disturbances that remove terrestrial biomass lower organic matter inputs into freshwater lakes, thereby reducing food web productivity. We focus on deltas formed at the stream-lake interface where terrestrial-derived particulate material is deposited. We find that organic matter export increases from more forested catchments, enhancing bacterial biomass. This transfers energy upwards through communities of heavier zooplankton, leading to a fourfold increase in weights of planktivorous young-of-the-year fish. At least 34% of fish biomass is supported by terrestrial primary production, increasing to 66% with greater forest cover. Habitat tracers confirm fish were closely associated with individual catchments, demonstrating that watershed protection and restoration increase biomass in critical life-stages of fish.

TI  - Limitations on using CDOM as a proxy for DOC in temperate lakes.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has been widely studied as part of efforts to improve understanding of the aquatic carbon cycle, by laboratory, in situ, and remote sensing methods. We studied ecoregion-scale differences in CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to understand variability in organic matter composition and the use of CDOM as a proxy for DOC. Data from 299 lakes across the U.S. Upper Midwest showed that CDOM, measured as absorptivity at 440 nm (a440), correlated strongly with DOC (R2 = 0.81, n = 412). Colored lakes in the Northern Lakes and Forests (NLF) ecoregion drove this relationship. Lakes in the North Central Hardwood Forests (NCHF) had low color (most had a440

TI  - Process-oriented estimation of column-integrated algal biomass in eutrophic lakes by MODIS/Aqua
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Algal blooms happen widely in eutrophic lakes. The satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration are commonly used as indicators to judge the water quality. However, vertical migration of phytoplankton may seriously affect the assessment accuracy of water quality with the surface status as an indicator. In fact, the water column-integrated algal biomass is better for describing the water quality. To remotely estimate the algal biomass considering the vertical Chl-a profile (uniform or otherwise), this paper proposed a novel process-oriented algorithm applied successfully in Lake Chaohu, China. First, we built a decision tree to identify the pixel-based Chl-a profile types using the floating algae index, surface Chl-a concentration, and wind speed. Then, the nonuniform profile was expressed as a power decay function ( Chl - a ( z ) = n 1 × z n 2 ) and parameterized using the surface Chl-a concentration. Finally, the algal biomass was derived from MODIS/Aqua satellite data. The estimation results were acceptable and the bias was −19.95%. The monthly mean algal biomass varied significantly and exhibited two peaks in spring and summer. The annual mean algal biomass increased from 2003 to 2010 (Pearson r = 0.82; p

TI  - Living in the litter: the influence of tree leaf litter on wetland communities
PY  - 2010
AB  - Empirical research in streams has demonstrated that terrestrial subsidies of tree leaf litter influence multiple community factors including composition, diversity and growth of individuals. However, little research has examined the importance of tree litter species on wetlands, which are ubiquitous across the landscape and serve as important habitats for a unique and diverse community of organisms. Using outdoor mesocosms, we assessed the impact of 12 litter monocultures and three litter mixtures (from both broadleaf and conifer trees) on pond communities containing gray tree frog tadpoles Hyla versicolor, periphyton, phytoplankton and zooplankton. We found that leaf litter species had substantial and differential impacts on all trophic groups in the community including effects on algal abundance, zooplankton density and amphibian growth. In many instances, patterns of responses were specific to individual litter species yet some responses, including both pH values and periphyton biomass, were generalizable to broad taxonomic groups. In addition, while most responses of litter mixtures were additive, we found evidence for antagonistic effects of litter mixing among responses of periphyton and amphibian body mass. Our results highlight the potential impact of human and naturally driven changes in forest composition on wetland communities through associated changes in leaf litter.

TI  - Performance and competitiveness of red vs. green phenotypes of a cyanobacterium grown under artificial lake browning
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Increasing inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to northern lakes is resulting in ‘lake browning.’ Lake browning profoundly affects phytoplankton community composition by modifying two important environmental drivers—light and nutrients. The impact of increased DOM on native isolates of red and green-pigmented cyanobacteria identified as Pseudanabaena, which emerged from a Dolichospermum bloom (Dickson Lake, Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada) in 2015, were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. The genomes were sequenced to identify phylogenetic relatedness and physiological similarities, and the physical and chemical effects of increased DOM on cellular performance and competitiveness were assessed. Our study findings were that the isolated red and green phenotypes are two distinct species belonging to the genus Pseudanabaena; that both isolates remained physiologically unaffected when grown independently under defined DOM regimes; and that neither red nor green phenotype achieved a competitive advantage when grown together under defined DOM regimes. While photosynthetic pigment diversity among phytoplankton offers niche-differentiation opportunities, the results of this study illustrate the coexistence of two distinct photosynthetic pigment phenotypes under increasing DOM conditions.</jats:p>

TI  - Duck–fish competition in boreal lakes – a review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Ducks share the aquatic environment with invertebrate-eating fish. Thus, competitive interactions may take place. Fish have been introduced to many formerly fishless lakes, which has profoundly affected the competitive and predatory relations in these waters. In this paper we review recent findings on duck–fish competitive interactions in boreal lakes. On a general level, analyses based on presence/absence data of fish have indicated that ducks can be negatively affected by fish. More rigorous studies where fish density has been considered have corroborated the pattern emerging from presence/absence studies. For the Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), the effect of competition has been tested experimentally. In general, it appears that diving ducks such as Common Goldeneye, which forage in open water, are the most affected by fish, Common Teal (Anas crecca) is intermediate, whereas Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), which forage among the shore vegetation, is little affected. Likelihood or the strength of competition between ducks and fish may also depend on habitat productivity and structure. Numbers of invertebrates are higher among vegetation where there are less fish preying on them. Duck–fish interactions are important to take into account when planning wetland creation and restoration for ducks. There is also an urgent need to mitigate the effects of fish introductions in wetlands.

TI  - Ecological and biogeochemical implications of the recovery of Eurasian beavers
PY  - 2016
AB  - In pre-industrial times beavers, ecosystem engineers, inhabited most of the Holarctic. Intensive exploitation over the last millennium, particularly in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, led to a dramatic decline in beaver populations. By the end of the 19th century the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) was at the verge of extirpation in many regions of Eurasia. However, during the 20th century, changes in management policy and reintroductions have resulted in a fast recovery of the species. Presently, Eurasian beavers are colonizing large parts of their former distribution range, and their population is still growing. Once again, beaver engineering and its outcomes are becoming prominent features of many streams in the boreal landscapes. The goal of this thesis was to investigate how the reintroduction and population recovery of Eurasian beavers might affect ecosystem functioning at local and landscape scales. The work was based on measurements from 12 beaver systems of various colonization histories (pioneer and recolonized) in Swedish boreal forests. Based on water chemistry measurements together with field and lab experiments, I evaluated the effect of beavers on processes of mercury methylation, litter decomposition, and the growth and respiration of benthic biofilms. I also investigated how beavers alter the nutrient limitation of biofilm activity. To assess the environmental effects of the reintroduction of beavers at the landscape scale, this empirical approach was complemented by a meta-analysis of 76 published studies on a total of 16 environmental factors. The results showed that beavers increased MeHg concentrations, decreased algal biomass accrual, and sometimes increased litter decomposition rates downstream compared to upstream beaver systems. However, distinct contrasting patterns were observed in pioneer and recolonized systems: While all the above effects were prominent in pioneer systems, they were moderate or absent in recolonized systems. Albeit algal accrual and community respiration were nutrient limited, beaver systems had no effect on the degree of limitation. Based on the meta-analysis, this thesis demonstrates that, when compared to a reference site, beavers can potentially affect all studied factors. The meta-analysis also identified gaps in knowledge regarding the dependency of beaver effects on different stages of age and colonization history. In conclusion, this thesis highlights: a) the importance of incorporating the successional stage and the colonization history of beaver systems when considering the effects of reintroducing beavers into stream ecosystems; and b) the lack of knowledge regarding these issues.

TI  - Interactive effects of temperature and habitat complexity on freshwater communities.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Warming can lead to increased growth of plants or algae at the base of the food web, which may increase the overall complexity of habitat available for other organisms. Temperature and habitat complexity have both been shown to alter the structure and functioning of communities, but they may also have interactive effects, for example, if the shade provided by additional habitat negates the positive effect of temperature on understory plant or algal growth. This study explored the interactive effects of these two major environmental factors in a manipulative field experiment, by assessing changes in ecosystem functioning (primary production and decomposition) and community structure in the presence and absence of artificial plants along a natural stream temperature gradient of 5–18°C. There was no effect of temperature or habitat complexity on benthic primary production, but epiphytic production increased with temperature in the more complex habitat. Cellulose decomposition rate increased with temperature, but was unaffected by habitat complexity. Macroinvertebrate communities were less similar to each other as temperature increased, while habitat complexity only altered community composition in the coldest streams. There was also an overall increase in macroinvertebrate abundance, body mass, and biomass in the warmest streams, driven by increasing dominance of snails and blackfly larvae. Presence of habitat complexity, however, dampened the strength of this temperature effect on the abundance of macroinvertebrates in the benthos. The interactive effects that were observed suggest that habitat complexity can modify the effects of temperature on important ecosystem functions and community structure, which may alter energy flow through the food web. Given that warming is likely to increase habitat complexity, particularly at higher latitudes, more studies should investigate these two major environmental factors in combination to improve our ability to predict the impacts of future global change.

TI  - Carbon dioxide stimulates lake primary production
PY  - 2018
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is a fundamental ecosystem process that sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) and forms the resource base for higher trophic levels. Still, the relative contribution of different controls on GPP at the whole-ecosystem scale is far from resolved. Here we show, by manipulating CO2 concentrations in large-scale experimental pond ecosystems, that CO2 availability is a key driver of whole-ecosystem GPP. This result suggests we need to reformulate past conceptual models describing controls of lake ecosystem productivity and include our findings when developing models used to predict future lake ecosystem responses to environmental change.

TI  - Brownification of freshwaters - the role of dissolved organic matter and iron
PY  - 2013
AB  - The term brownification refers to the trend of increasing water color, i.e. the water becoming browner, which has been observed throughout the northern hemisphere over the last decades. Brownification has both ecological and societal implications. From an ecological point of view the impaired light climate may e.g. reduce aquatic primary production and affect predator-prey interactions within the water, while from a societal point of view brownification may obstruct drinking water purification and reduce the recreational value of lakes. Traditionally, the increasing water color has been ascribed to increasing concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the catchment, as DOM concentrations and water color often correlate both spatially and temporally. Several mechanisms have been proposed as the driver behind the increasing DOM concentration, e.g. decreasing acidification, land-use changes and climate change with increasing precipitation and temperature. Interestingly, in many cases the water color has increased more than the DOM concentration, implying that increasing DOM concentration alone is not sufficient to explain the increase in water color. Thus, there must be other factors also affecting the water color. In this thesis I show, in a field experiment, that lower acid load results in a higher net charge of the organic matter in soils and thereby a higher solubility and mobility, which should facilitate a higher transport of DOM from the terrestrial to the aquatic system. Moreover, concurrent with the increase in mobility, there was a change in the quality of the DOM, where DOM from a lower acid load was relatively more colored, aromatic and of higher molecular weight. Thus, a reduction in acid load may contribute to brownification by increasing the export and the color of terrestrially derived DOM to the aquatic system. Experiments were performed to test if the altered quality of the mobile soil DOM may affect its reactivity in the aquatic system. It was found that the susceptibility to photodegradation increases, while the susceptibility to bacterial degradation decreases. The relative importance of each turnover process may hence be altered due to the decreasing acidification. Another factor affecting the water color of freshwaters is the concentration of iron (Fe) in the water. Still, the potential role of Fe to brownification has not previously been addressed. Data from long-term monitoring showed that water color of most Swedish rivers have increased significantly since the early 1970’s. More surprisingly, most rivers also exhibit strongly increasing iron concentrations (up to 470 %). Increases is DOM concentration were significantly lower than the increase in water color and theoretically, variations in Fe concentration could explain on average 25 % and up to 75 % of increasing water color. Fe plays a key role in aquatic systems, affecting the biogeochemical cycling of many major elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus the increasing Fe concentrations may have profound consequences. By analyzing within-year variations in water chemistry, air temperature, and dis- charge of three Swedish rivers, I explored what control Fe concentrations. It appears that variations in Fe concentrations are primarily driven by redox dynamics in the catchment. High discharge and high temperature create conditions that favor bacterial activities and reductive dissolution of the largely insoluble Fe(III) to the more soluble Fe(II). Fe(II) may then be transported from the soil to the aquatic system. Once in the oxic stream water, interactions with DOM maintain the Fe in solution. Furthermore, long-term trends of increasing air temperature and discharge in these catch-ments may have extended the periods of reducing conditions by increasing microbial activity and soil saturation, and thus have facilitated Fe transport to the aquatic system. In summary, it appears that in south Sweden, where the acidification has been high historically, the impact of decreasing acidification on organic matter mobility may be a major factor behind brownification, whereas in the north where the acidification has been much more restricted, increasing Fe concentrations may be more important. Climate change with increasing precipitation and temperature may increase the prevalence of reducing conditions in the soils, further facilitating the export of Fe to the aquatic system and causing a continuous brownification of the freshwaters.

TI  - Diatom-inferred changes in effective moisture during the late Holocene from nearshore cores in the southeastern region of the Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (Canada)
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB), within the boreal forest region of northwest Ontario, is a region that is expected to be negatively affected by climate warming. Inferences of droughts over the past two millennia from Little Raleigh Lake were based on two nearshore sediment cores. The core locations were from depths of ~12 and 15 m and were based on sufficient nearshore sediment accumulation and distance from the modern benthic-to-planktonic diatom boundary, where a distinct shift from dominance of benthic taxa changed to dominance of planktonic taxa in surficial sediments at ~11.8 m. Diatom-inferred depth was based on a model developed from 60 surficial sediments within the study lake. Depth inferences indicate that prolonged periods of aridity occurred from ~ad 950 to 1300 (corresponds to ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’) and from ~ad 1625 to 1750 (aridity during ‘Little Ice Age’). We found that the core collected from a depth closer to the benthic-to-planktonic diatom boundary was more sensitive to changes in lake level than the deeper core where planktonic diatoms dominated the assemblage. The inferred low-water stands of the past two millennia are well outside of the range of the past ~100 years, suggesting that recent drought history may not be a good estimate of future extremes.

TI  - Roles of Terrestrial Carbon Subsidies to Aquatic Community Metabolism in Mountain Lake Ecosystems
PY  - 2016
AB  - Terrestrial–aquatic linkages of Japanese mountain lake ecosystems were examined to identify terrestrial carbon input into mountain lakes and the importance of the allochthonous carbon for the ecosystem metabolism of aquatic food webs therein. Stable carbon isotope analyses revealed that the flux of terrestrial dissolved organic matter from the surrounding catchments was relatively larger in smaller lakes with higher drainage ratios and tended to predominate carbon cycling in the epilimnetic water of such lakes. However, the metabolic balance of epilimnetic lake waters was net autotrophic or approximately in balance between gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) rates, suggesting that allochthonous organic matter generally subsidizes benthic and hypolimnetic communities. Empirical models established based on these observed GPP and CR values predict that climate change may increase carbon flows from both autochthonous and allochthonous pathways in epilimnetic communities of unproductive mountain lakes, directly through the functional dependence of community metabolism on the projected temperature rise and indirectly through the increased supply of terrestrial organic matter.

TI  - Droplet digital PCR assays for the quantification of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from environmental DNA collected in the water of mountain lakes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Classical methods for estimating the abundance of fish populations are often both expensive, time-consuming and destructive. Analyses of the environmental DNA (eDNA) present in water samples could alleviate such constraints. Here, we developed protocols to detect and quantify brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) populations by applying the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to eDNA molecules extracted from water samples collected in 28 Swedish mountain lakes. Overall, contemporary fish CPUE (catch per unit effort) estimates from standardized survey gill nettings were not correlated to eDNA concentrations for either of the species. In addition, the measured environmental variables (e.g. dissolved organic carbon concentrations, temperature, and pH) appear to not influence water eDNA concentrations of the studied fish species. Detection probabilities via eDNA analysis showed moderate success (less than 70% for both species) while the presence of eDNA from Arctic char (in six lakes) and brown trout (in one lake) was also indicated in lakes where the species were not detected with the gillnetting method. Such findings highlight the limits of one or both methods to reliably detect fish species presence in natural systems. Additional analysis showed that the filtration of water samples through 1.2 μm glass fiber filters and 0.45 μm mixed cellulose ester filters was more efficient in recovering DNA than using 0.22 μm enclosed polyethersulfone filters, probably due to differential efficiencies of DNA extraction. Altogether, this work showed the potentials and limits of the approach for the detection and the quantification of fish abundance in natural systems while providing new insights in the application of the ddPCR method applied to environmental DNA.

TI  - Community structure influences species' abundance along environmental gradients.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Species' response to abiotic environmental variation can be influenced by local community structure and interspecific interactions, particularly in restricted habitats such as islands and lakes. In temperate lakes, future increase in water temperature and run-off of terrestrial (allochthonous) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are predicted to alter community composition and the overall ecosystem productivity. However, little is known about how the present community structure and abiotic environmental variation interact to affect the abundance of native fish populations. We used a space-for-time approach to study how local community structure interact with lake morphometric and climatic characteristics (i.e. temperature and catchment productivity) to affect brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) yield in 283 Norwegian lakes located in different biogeographical regions. Brown trout yield (based on data from standardized survey gill net fishing; g 100 m(-2) gill net night(-1)) was generally lower in lakes where other fish species were present than in lakes with brown trout only. The yield showed an overall negative relationship with increasing temperature and a positive relationship with lake shoreline complexity. Brown trout yield was also negatively correlated with DOC load (measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) and lake size and depth (measured using terrain slope as a proxy), but only in lakes where other fish species were present. The observed negative response of brown trout yield to increasing DOC load and proportion of the pelagic open-water area is likely due to restricted (littoral) niche availability and competitive dominance of more pelagic fishes such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)). Our study highlights that, through competitive interactions, the local community structure can influence the response of a species' abundance to variation in abiotic conditions. Changes in biomass and niche use of top predators (such as the brown trout), associated with predicted changes in direct and indirect climatic factors, may have further influences on the structure and function of temperate lake ecosystems.

TI  - The effects of storm-induced events on the seasonal dynamics of epilithic algal biomass in subtropical mountain streams
PY  - 2014
AB  - Information concerning the drivers of seasonal variation in algal biomass in subtropical mountain streams is limited. To identify the drivers of biomass dynamics for epilithic algae, a 20-month study was conducted in mountain streams in Taiwan, an area characterised by different levels of riparian vegetation coverage and agricultural activity, in which a process-based model was optimally fit to field data. We found that episodic typhoon-induced floods were the major drivers shaping the seasonal variations in algal biomass. Flow-induced detachment was frequently observed in periods of higher algal biomass. In contrast, an increased flow stimulated algal growth during periods with slower flow rates. Increased temperature stimulated algal growth at sites with an open canopy cover and higher light availability but constrained biomass at sites with dense canopy shading. Overall, scraper biomass exerted less influence on algal biomass than did environmental factors. The effects of grazing were visible only at the pristine, low-stream-order site in winter. The effects of minimal algal biomass required for recovery was comparable to environmental factors only at sites with intermediate canopy cover, moderate discharge, and higher nutrient concentrations. We suggest that agricultural activity and riparian vegetation can affect epilithic algal biomass in subtropical mountain streams.

TI  - Colour classification of 1486 lakes across a wide range of optical water types
PY  - 2018
AB  - Remote sensing by satellite-borne sensors presents a significant opportunity to enhance the spatio-temporal coverage of environmental monitoring programmes for lakes, but the estimation of classic water quality attributes from inland water bodies has not reached operational status due to the difficulty of discerning the spectral signatures of optically active water constituents. Determination of water colour, as perceived by the human eye, does not require knowledge of inherent optical properties and therefore represents a generally applicable remotely-sensed water quality attribute. In this paper, we implemented a recent algorithm for the retrieval of colour parameters (hue angle, dominant wavelength) and derived a new correction for colour purity to account for the spectral bandpass of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We used this algorithm to calculate water colour on almost 45,000 observations over four years from 1486 lakes from a diverse range of optical water types in New Zealand. We show that the most prevalent lake colours are yellow-orange and blue, respectively, while green observations are comparatively rare. About 40% of the study lakes show transitions between colours at a range of time scales, including seasonal. A preliminary exploratory analysis suggests that both geo-physical and anthropogenic factors, such as catchment land use, provide environmental control of lake colour and are promising avenues for future analysis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in the sign and magnitude of ecosystem engineer effects on lake ecosystem production
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ecosystem engineers can have diverse and conflicting effects on their ecosystems, and the balance between these effects can depend on the physical environment. This context dependence means that environmental variation can produce large differences in engineer effects through space and time. Here, we explore how local variability in environmental conditions can lead to large spatiotemporal variation in the effect of tube‐building midges on benthic ecosystem metabolism in a shallow subarctic lake. Using field experiments, we found that midge engineering increases both gross primary production (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">GPP</jats:styled-content>) and respiration (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">RESP</jats:styled-content>) in the sediment. Gross primary production and <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">RESP</jats:styled-content> have opposing influences on net ecosystem production, and the net effect of midges on the benthic ecosystem depends on the balance between their effects on <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">GPP</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">RESP</jats:styled-content>. Variation in light mediates this balance—under high light conditions, primary producers are able to exploit the structural benefits provided by midges, while in the dark, the elevation of respiration from midge engineering predominates. Benthic light levels vary spatially and temporally due to episodic cyanobacterial blooms that prevent almost all light from reaching the benthos. By quantifying the nonlinear relationship between midge engineering and light, we were able to project ecosystem‐wide consequences of natural variation in light conditions across the lake. Our results illustrate how the sign and magnitude of ecosystem‐wide effects of ecosystem engineers can vary through space and time.</jats:p>

TI  - Quality transformation of dissolved organic carbon during water transit through lakes : contrasting controls by photochemical and biological processes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be removed, transformed, or added during water transit through lakes, resulting in changes in DOC composition and pigmentation (color). However, the process-based understanding of these changes is incomplete, especially for headwater lakes. We hypothesized that because heterotrophic bacteria preferentially consume noncolored DOC, while photochemical processing removes colored fractions, the overall changes in DOC color upon water passage through a lake depend on the relative importance of these two processes, accordingly. To test this hypothesis we combined laboratory experiments with field studies in nine boreal lakes, assessing both the relative importance of different DOC decay processes (biological or photochemical) and the loss of color during water transit time (WTT) through the lakes. We found that influence from photo-decay dominated changes in DOC quality in the epilimnia of relatively clear headwater lakes, resulting in systematic and selective net losses of colored DOC. However, in highly pigmented brown-water lakes (absorbance at 420 nm > 7 m−1) biological processes dominated, and there was no systematic relationship between color loss and WTT. Moreover, in situ data and dark experiments supported our hypothesis on the selective microbial removal of nonpigmented DOC, mainly of low molecular weight, leading to persistent water color in these highly colored lakes. Our study shows that brown headwater lakes may not conform to the commonly reported pattern of the selective removal of colored constituents in freshwaters, as DOC can show a sustained degree of pigmentation upon transit through these lakes.

TI  - Cyanobacterial Responses to UV Radiation
PY  - 2012
AB  - The influence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on populations of microorganisms has been the subject of serious investigation for at least the past 20–25 years. UVR that is applicable to the Earth’s surface (past or present) is arbitrarily divided into UVA (400–320 or 315 nm), UVB (280–320 or 315 nm), UVC (∼180–280 nm). Although essentially all organisms are affected by UVR, microorganisms show more rapid, immediate and measurable effects than macro-organisms. This chapter is mainly relegated to UVR and cyanobacteria, although UV effects on other phototrophs and microorganisms, when relevant, will be included. Some ancestors of living cyanobacteria, the oldest oxygenic organisms, may have evolved in the Archean or early Proterozoic Eons, from 3.5 to 2.5 Gyr, respectively, in a time when UV radiation fluxes reaching the surface, particularly UVB and UVC, were much higher than at present. The latter wavelength region (UVC) does not reach the Earth’s surface at present. Thus, cyanobacteria and other microorganisms in that distant age had to have evolved a strategy to tolerate these greater levels of UV radiation, and at present this strategy may demonstrably involve multiple devices, even within one organism. The best understood in the past several years for numerous organisms has been the active metabolic strategies that compensate for the destruction of vital genetic components, such as the development of efficient metabolic DNA repair systems. The implementation of gliding motility system for escaping the effects of high visible and UV radiation has been better described and understood. Some of the most revealing results in the last 10 years have been an almost complete understanding of the regulation of the UV-protective compounds, scytonemin and mycosporine-like compounds, that partially or completely avoid the damage caused by UV radiation.

TI  - Responses of benthic algae to nutrient enrichment in a shallow lake: Linking community production, biomass, and composition
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding how nutrient limitation affects algal biomass and production is a long‐standing interest in aquatic ecology. Nutrients can influence these whole‐community characteristics through several mechanisms, including shifting community composition. Therefore, incorporating the joint responses of biomass, taxonomic composition, and production of algal communities, and relationships among them, is important for understanding effects of nutrient enrichment. In shallow subarctic Lake Mývatn, Iceland, benthic algae compose a majority of whole‐lake primary production, support high secondary production, and influence nutrient cycling. Given the importance of these ecosystem processes, the factors that limit benthic algae have a large effect on the function and dynamics of the Mývatn system. In a 33‐day nutrient enrichment experiment conducted in Lake Mývatn, we measured the joint responses of benthic algal biomass, primary production, and composition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supplementation. We enriched N and P using nutrient‐diffusing agar overlain by sediment, with three levels of N and P that were crossed in a factorial design. We found little evidence of community‐wide nutrient limitation, as chlorophyll‐a concentrations showed a negligible response to nutrients. Gross primary production (GPP) was unaffected by P and inhibited by N enrichment after 10 days, although the inhibitory effect of N diminished by day 33. In contrast to biomass and primary production, community composition was strongly affected by N and marginally affected by P, with some algal groups increasing and others decreasing with enrichment. The taxa with the most negative and positive responses to N enrichment were Fragilariaceae and Scenedesmus, respectively. The abundances of particular algal groups, based on standardised cell counts, were related to GPP measured at the end of the experiment. Oocystis was negatively associated with GPP but was unaffected by N or P, while Fragilariaceae and Scenedesmus were positively associated with GPP but had opposite responses to N. As a result, nutrient‐induced compositional shifts did not alter GPP. Overall, our results show that nutrient enrichment can have large effects on algal community composition while having little effect on total biomass and primary production. Our study suggests that nutrient‐driven compositional shifts may not alter the overall ecological function of algal communities if (1) taxa have contrasting responses to nutrient enrichment but have similar effects on ecological processes, and/or (2) taxa that have strong influences on ecological function are not strongly affected by nutrients.

TI  - Trophic transfer of biodiversity effects: functional equivalence of prey diversity and enrichment?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Producer diversity is frequently assumed to be detrimental to herbivores, because less edible taxa are more likely to dominate diverse communities. Many producers are, however, complementary in their resource use, and primary production is often positively related to producer diversity. We performed an experiment with microalgae and a generalist herbivore to explore the hypothesis that such positive effects are transferred up the food chain and are functionally comparable to effects of enrichment with a limiting resource. In both absence and presence of grazers, primary production was positively affected by both light supply and producer diversity. Survival, reproduction, and biomass of herbivores were also positively affected by light supply and producer diversity, with both factors contributing equally to grazer performance. We conclude that producer diversity can indeed have similar positive effects on secondary production as enrichment with a limiting resource and discuss conditions under which such positive effects are likely to dominate over negative ones.

TI  - Toward a more comprehensive theory of zooplankton diel vertical migration: integrating ultraviolet radiation and water transparency into the biotic paradigm
PY  - 2011
AB  - The current prevailing theory of diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is focused largely on two biotic drivers: food and predation. Yet recent evidence suggests that abiotic drivers such as damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation and temperature are also important. Here we integrate current knowledge on the effects of abiotic factors on DVM with the current biologically based paradigm to develop a more comprehensive framework for understanding DVM in zooplankton. We focus on “normal” (down during the day, up at night) DVM of holoplanktonic, primarily herbivorous zooplankton. This new transparency-regulator hypothesis differentiates between structural drivers, such as temperature and food, that vary little over a 24-h period and dynamic drivers, such as damaging UV radiation and visual predation, that show strong variation over a 24-h period. This hypothesis emphasizes the central role of water transparency in regulating these major drivers of DVM. In less transparent systems, temperature and food are often optimal in the surface waters, visual predators are abundant, and UV radiation levels are low. In contrast, in more transparent systems, vertical thermal gradients tend to be more gradual, food quality and quantity are higher in deeper waters, and visual predator abundance is often lower and damaging UV radiation higher in the surface waters. This transparency-regulator hypothesis provides a more versatile theoretical framework to explain variation in DVM across waters of differing transparency. This hypothesis also enables clearer predictions of how the wide range of ongoing transparency-altering local, regional, and global environmental changes can be expected to influence DVM patterns in both inland and oceanic waters of the world.

AB  - There is limited knowledge of microbial carbon fixation rate, and carbon-fixing microbial abundance and diversity in saline lakes. In this study, the inorganic carbon uptake rates and carbon-fixing microbial populations were investigated in the surface sediments of lakes with a full range of salinity from freshwater to salt saturation. The results showed that in the studied lakes light-dependent bicarbonate uptake contributed substantially (> 70%) to total bicarbonate uptake, while the contribution of dark bicarbonate uptake (1.35-25.17%) cannot be ignored. The light-dependent bicarbonate uptake rates were significantly correlated with pH and turbidity, while dark bicarbonate uptake rates were significantly influenced by dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, temperature, and salinity. Carbon-fixing microbial populations using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CCB) pathway were widespread in the studied lakes, and they were dominated by the cbbL and cbbM gene types affiliated with Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, respectively. The cbbL and cbbM gene abundance and population structures were significantly affected by different environmental variables, with the cbbL and cbbM genes being negatively correlated with salinity and organic carbon concentration, respectively. In summary, this study improves our knowledge of the abundance, diversity and function of carbon-fixing microbial populations in the lakes with a full range of salinity.

TI  - Habitat-Mediated Responses of Zooplankton to Decreasing Light in Two Temperate Lakes Undergoing Long-Term Browning
PY  - 2020
AB  - Increases in dissolved organic matter and the consequent “browning” of some lakes in recent decades are reducing water transparency to both ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation with important, but poorly understood ecosystem-level consequences for zooplankton grazers. The prevailing resource-based unimodal hypothesis posits that nutrients in dissolved organic matter stimulate primary production in clear-water lakes, while shading by dissolved organic matter inhibits primary production in browner lakes, with zooplankton responses following the patterns of their food resources. Support for this hypothesis derives primarily from short-term experiments, space-for-time analyses, and modeling studies. Here we use three decades of long-term monitoring data from two temperate lakes to assess zooplankton responses to changes in not only resources (chlorophyll) as drivers of change, but also light-related habitat variables (ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation, surface and deep-water temperatures, deep-water dissolved oxygen, and pH). The study lakes include one clear-water lake and one browner lake, both of which have experienced long-term browning. Given that zooplankton depth distribution and body size can vary with water transparency, color, and temperature, we test for responses in not only overall zooplankton abundance, but also in vertical distribution and body size. We also examine the ability of the relationship between short-term interannual variation in the driver versus response variables to predict long-term zooplankton trends. The primary responses of zooplankton were strong changes in abundance that varied with taxon and life history stage in response to habitat variables rather than food resources. Only two groups showed vertical distribution responses, and they trended toward deeper distributions with browning. There was no significant change in body size ratio. The directionality of the response of zooplankton abundance to interannual variability in the driver variables was consistent with those observed in the long-term trends for 33 of 80 comparisons (41%), though only three of those (4%) had statistically significant short-term interannual variability relationships. We conclude that habitat-related changes associated with browning in lakes have important consequences for zooplankton community structure with stronger effects in clear-water lakes than in browner lakes, and that even at the whole-lake scale short-term data are generally not adequate to predict long-term responses.

TI  - Foraging success of juvenile pike Esox lucius depends on visual conditions and prey pigmentation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Young-of-the-year pike Esox lucius foraging on copepods experienced different foraging success depending on prey pigmentation in water visually degraded by brown colouration or algae. Both attack rate and prey consumption rate were higher for E. lucius foraging on transparent prey in brown water, whereas the opposite was true in algal turbid water. Pigments in copepod prey may have a cryptic function in brown water instead of a photo-protective function even if prey-size selectivity was stronger than selection based on pigmentation in juvenile E. lucius.

TI  - Differentiation in Aquatic Metabolism between Littoral Habitats with Floating-Leaved and Submerged Macrophyte Growth Forms in a Shallow Eutrophic Lake
PY  - 2019
AB  - The metabolic balance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) is known to display large spatial and temporal variations within shallow lakes. Thus, although estimation of aquatic metabolism using free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration has become increasingly common, the explanation of the variance in the metabolic regime remains an extremely difficult task. In this study, rates of GPP, respiration (R) and the metabolic balance (net ecosystem production, NEP) were estimated in four littoral habitats with different macrophyte growth forms (floating-leaved vs submerged) over a 28-month period in lake of Kastoria (Greece), a shallow eutrophic lake. Our results showed that net heterotrophy prevailed over the studied period, suggesting that allochthonous organics fuel respiration processes in the littoral. Temporal variation in the metabolic rates was driven mainly by the seasonal variation in irradiance and water temperature, with the peak of metabolic activity occurring in summer and early autumn. Most importantly, significant spatial variation among the four habitats was observed and associated with the different macrophyte growth forms that occurred in the sites. The results highlight the importance of habitat specific characteristics for the assessment of metabolic balance and underline the potentially high contribution of littoral habitats to the whole lake metabolism.

TI  - Decoupled trophic responses to long-term recovery from acidification and associated browning in lakes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Increases in the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been documented in many inland waters in recent decades, a process known as "browning". Previous studies have often used space-for-time substitution to examine the direct consequences of increased DOM on lake ecosystems. However, browning often occurs concomitant with other ecologically important water chemistry changes that may interact with or overwhelm any potential ecological response to browning itself. Here we examine a long-term (~20 year) dataset of 28 lakes in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA, that have undergone strong browning in response to recovery from acidification. With these data, we explored how primary producer and zooplankton consumer populations changed during this time and what physical and chemical changes best predicted these long-term ecosystem changes. Our results indicate that changes in primary producers are likely driven by reduced water clarity due to browning, independent of changes in nutrients, counter to previously hypothesized primary producer response to browning. In contrast, declines in calcium concomitant with browning play an important role in driving long-term declines in zooplankton biomass. Our results indicate that responses to browning at different trophic levels are decoupled from one another. Concomitant chemical changes have important implications for our understanding of the response of aquatic ecosystems to browning.

TI  - Water Transparency Drives Intra-Population Divergence in Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Trait combinations that lead to a higher efficiency in resource utilization are important drivers of divergent natural selection and adaptive radiation. However, variation in environmental features might constrain foraging in complex ways and therefore impede the exploitation of critical resources. We tested the effect of water transparency on intra-population divergence in morphology of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) across seven lakes in central Sweden. Morphological divergence between near-shore littoral and open-water pelagic perch substantially increased with increasing water transparency. Reliance on littoral resources increased strongly with increasing water transparency in littoral populations, whereas littoral reliance was not affected by water transparency in pelagic populations. Despite the similar reliance on pelagic resources in pelagic populations along the water transparency gradient, the utilization of particular pelagic prey items differed with variation in water transparency in pelagic populations. Pelagic perch utilized cladocerans in lakes with high water transparency and copepods in lakes with low water transparency. We suggest that under impaired visual conditions low utilization of littoral resources by littoral perch and utilization of evasive copepods by pelagic perch may lead to changes in morphology. Our findings indicate that visual conditions can affect population divergence in predator populations through their effects on resource utilization.

TI  - Understanding the Effects of Climate Change via Disturbance on Pristine Arctic Lakes—Multitrophic Level Response and Recovery to a 12-Yr, Low-Level Fertilization Experiment
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Effects of climate change‐driven disturbance on lake ecosystems can be subtle; indirect effects include increased nutrient loading that could impact ecosystem function. We designed a low‐level fertilization experiment to mimic persistent, climate change‐driven disturbances (deeper thaw, greater weathering, or thermokarst failure) delivering nutrients to arctic lakes. We measured responses of pelagic trophic levels over 12 yr in a fertilized deep lake with fish and a shallow fishless lake, compared to paired reference lakes, and monitored recovery for 6 yr. Relative to prefertilization in the deep lake, we observed a maximum pelagic response in chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (+201%), dissolved oxygen (DO, −43%), and zooplankton biomass (+88%) during the fertilization period (2001–2012). Other responses to fertilization, such as water transparency and fish relative abundance, were delayed, but both ultimately declined. Phyto‐ and zooplankton biomass and community composition shifted with fertilization. The effects of fertilization were less pronounced in the paired shallow lakes, because of a natural thermokarst failure likely impacting the reference lake. In the deep lake there was (a) moderate resistance to change in ecosystem functions at all trophic levels, (b) eventual responses were often nonlinear, and (c) postfertilization recovery (return) times were most rapid at the base of the food web (2–4 yr) while higher trophic levels failed to recover after 6 yr. The timing and magnitude of responses to fertilization in these arctic lakes were similar to responses in other lakes, suggesting indirect effects of climate change that modify nutrient inputs may affect many lakes in the future.</jats:p>

TI  - Changes in spectral quality of underwater light alter phytoplankton community composition
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Light is a fundamental resource for phytoplankton. To utilize the available light, most phytoplankton species possess pigments in taxon‐specific combinations and quantities, which in turn result in a specific use of certain wavelengths. This optimizes the light use efficiency, allows for a complementary use of light, and may be an additional driver for community structure. While the effects of light intensity on phytoplankton biomass production and community composition have been intensively studied, here we focused on the effects of specific light spectrum quality (thus light color) on a natural phytoplankton community. In a controlled mesocosm experiment we reduced the supplied wavelength range to its blue, green, or red part of the light spectrum and compared the responses of each treatment to a full spectrum control over 28 d. Highest community growth rates were observed under blue, lowest under red light. Light absorption by the communities showed adaptation toward the supplied wavelength range. Community composition was significantly affected by light quality treatments, driven by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta, whereas pigment composition was not. Furthermore, lower species richness but higher evenness occurred when communities were exposed to red light compared to the full spectrum. We expected the response of phytoplankton communities to changes in the light spectrum to be driven by a combination of species sorting and pigment acclimation; however, the effect of species sorting turned out to be stronger. Our study showed that, even if species might acclimate, changes in the available light spectrum affect primary production and phytoplankton community composition.</jats:p>

TI  - Riparian soil temperature modification of the relationship between flow and dissolved organic carbon concentration in a boreal stream
PY  - 2011
AB  - Discharge is often strongly correlated to the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]) in watercourses. One recently proposed way to model this is the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM) concept that accounts for the role of flow pathway control on [DOC] dynamics in streams. However, in boreal systems, there is also commonly a seasonal pattern, which cannot be explained by variability in discharge alone. The objectives with this study were to (1) demonstrate RIM as a tool for studying variability in stream water chemistry, (2) investigate factors related to stream water DOC variability, and (3) modify RIM to account for these factors. RIM was used with 14 years of daily discharge and almost 500 stream measurements of [DOC] from a forested boreal headwater stream. We used the calibrated RIM to account for discharge influences and then investigated variables that could be related to DOC variability (air and soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, antecedent flow and stream sulfate). Five alternative formulations of RIM, with temporally varying soil concentration profiles based on the variability in soil temperature and/or antecedent flow, were evaluated. The model where only the effects of riparian soil temperature on dynamics in DOC depth profiles were included performed best overall. This dynamic RIM improved the Nash-Sutcliffe to 0.58 compared to 0.42 for the flow-only formulation and reduced the median absolute error from 3.0 to 2.1 mg L (-1). This study demonstrates that RIM is a simple way of modeling stream DOC and exploring controls on stream water chemistry.

TI  - Impact of future climate scenarios on peatland and constructed wetland water quality: A mesocosm experiment within climate chambers
PY  - 2021
AB  - Water purification is one of the most essential services provided by wetlands. A lot of concerns regarding wetlands subjected to climate change relate to their susceptibility to hydrological change and the increase in temperature as a result of global warming. A warmer condition may accelerate the rate of decomposition and release of nutrients, which can be exported downstream and cause serious ecological challenges; e.g., eutrophication and acidification. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on water quality in peatland and constructed wetland ecosystems subject to water level management. For this purpose, the authors simulated the current climate scenario base on the database from Malmo station (Scania, Sweden) for 2016 and 2017 as well as the future climate scenarios for the last 30 years of the century based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and different regional climate models (RCM) for a region wider than Scania County. For future climate change, the authors simulated low (RCP 2.6), moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate scenarios. All simulations were conducted within climate chambers for experimental peatland and constructed wetland mesocosms. Our results demonstrate that the effect of climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands (interactive effect) for the combined chemical variables. The warmest climate scenario RCP 8.5 is linked to a higher water purification function for constructed wetlands, but to a lower water purification function and a subsequent deterioration of peatland water qualities, even if subjected to water level management. The explanation for the different response of constructed wetlands and peatlands to climate change could be due to the fact that the substrate in the constructed wetland mesocosms and peatlands was different in terms of the organic matter quality and quantity. The utilization of nutrients by the plants and microbial community readily exceed the mineralization under a limited nutrient content (as we had in constructed wetland) when the temperature rises. However, concerning the extreme scenario RCP 8.5, the peatlands have shown a tendency to have reverse processes.

TI  - Size-related photosynthesis of algae in a strongly stratified humic lake
PY  - 2009
AB  - We studied the size-specific phytoplankton production and chlorophyll-based biomass in Lake Valkea-Kotinen, where the epilimnetic nutrient concentrations during stratification are low and the phytoplankton community mainly consists of flagellates. We hypothesized that in this humic lake, where large diatoms are few, small species are favoured. For a complete size range, autotrophic picoplankton (APP) were included in the study. We sampled the pristine headwater lake in 2005 and in addition to size-fractionated production and biomass, we also identified the species and calculated the biovolume-based biomass estimates. In contrast to our hypothesis, most of the production was composed of a few large cell size taxa with flagella, e.g. Gonyostomum semen during stratification and Peridinium spp. during overturn periods. The large micro-plankton, mainly G. semen, were the dominant primary producers (46―72% of the total primary production) from late June until the late September. G. semen was also superior in terms of chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic rate, whereas APP were less efficient and thus less successful. Our results indicate that in this lake, the large-sized flagellated phytoplankton could largely overcome nutrient limitation and thus solar irradiance was presumably the main driver for the production of phytoplankton.

TI  - Carbon gas fluxes from a brown‐water and a clear‐water lake in the boreal zone during a summer with extreme rain events
PY  - 2010
AB  - We studied CO2 and CH4 fluxes from two boreal lakes with differing trophic status (chlorophyll a 17.8 vs. 48.7 mg m−2) and water color (100 vs. 20 mg Pt L−1) throughout an open-water period when summer precipitation doubled, using both floating chambers and concentration gradients. Fluxes measured in chambers were higher, but irrespective of the method, both lakes were heterotrophic and were annual sources of carbon gases to the atmosphere. However, with the annual CO2 flux of 6.85 (chambers) or 5.43 mol m−2 (gradients), the humic lake had notably higher emissions than the clear-water lake, where the fluxes were 3.97 and 3.38 mol m−2, respectively. The annual CH4 flux from the clear-water lake was 28.5 (chambers) or 20.5 mmol m−2 (gradients) and from the humic lake 20.7 or 16.2 mmol m−2, respectively. There were interlake differences in seasonal patterns, but the most obvious changes in fluxes occurred during or just after the rains. In the humic lake, the resulting peak in CO2 and CH4 flux was responsible for 46% and 48% of the annual flux, respectively. Before the rains, the clear-water lake was a small sink of CO2 or had near-zero efflux but afterwards became a source of CO2. In the humic lake, biological mineralization explained the majority of the fluxes, whereas in the clear-water lake the association between the biological processes and fluxes was less pronounced.

TI  - Feasting on terrestrial organic matter: Dining in a dark lake changes microbial decomposition.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Boreal lakes are major components of the global carbon cycle, partly because of sediment-bound heterotrophic microorganisms that decompose within-lake and terrestrially derived organic matter (t-OM). The ability for sediment bacteria to break down and alter t-OM may depend on environmental characteristics and community composition. However, the connection between these two potential drivers of decomposition is poorly understood. We tested how bacterial activity changed along experimental gradients in the quality and quantity of t-OM inputs into littoral sediments of two small boreal lakes, a dark and a clear lake, and measured the abundance of operational taxonomic units and functional genes to identify mechanisms underlying bacterial responses. We found that bacterial production (BP) decreased across lakes with aromatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediment pore water, but the process underlying this pattern differed between lakes. Bacteria in the dark lake invested in the energetically costly production of extracellular enzymes as aromatic DOM increased in availability in the sediments. By contrast, bacteria in the clear lake may have lacked the nutrients and/or genetic potential to degrade aromatic DOM and instead mineralized photo-degraded OM into CO2 . The two lakes differed in community composition, with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and pH differentiating microbial assemblages. Furthermore, functional genes relating to t-OM degradation were relatively higher in the dark lake. Our results suggest that future changes in t-OM inputs to lake sediments will have different effects on carbon cycling depending on the potential for photo-degradation of OM and composition of resident bacterial communities.

TI  - Regime shifts between macrophytes and phytoplankton – concepts beyond shallow lakes, unravelling stabilizing mechanisms and practical consequences
PY  - 2015
AB  - espanolExiste el concepto teorico para lagos poco profundos de los mecanismos de retroalimentacion que ocurren entre los macrofitos y la fase clara del agua y que resultan en estados alternativos de estabilidad. En este trabajo, reviso estudios recientes aplicando este concepto a otros sistemas de aguas continentales, descifrando los mecanismos de estabilizacion y discutiendo las consecuencias de los cambios de regimen. Modelos recientes predicen que pueden ocurrir cambios abruptos entre estados de aguas claras y turbias tambien en las partes bajas de los rios, tanto en el tiempo como en el espacio. Estos resultados se apoyan en largas series temporales de datos en rios de Espana y Alemania. Un modelo en un lago profundo revelo que los macrofitos sumergidos tambien pueden reducir significativamente la biomasa de fitoplancton entre un 50 y 15% en lagos oligotroficos de entre 11 y 100 m de profundidad. Pero los mecanismos que determinan las condiciones para la estabilidad de la fase de aguas claras estan aun lejos de ser bien comprendidos. Los datos disponibles sugieren que la composicion de la comunidad de macrofitos afecta el numero y tipo de mecanismos que estabilizan las condiciones de aguas claras. No hay duda de los efectos alelopaticos generados por los macrofitos en el fitoplancton, sin embargo, se ha encontrado que la colonizacion bacteriana en macrofitos y fitoplancton, las interacciones del fitoplancton, las adaptaciones locales y la sensibilidad especifica de cada cepa modulan estas interacciones. Estan apareciendo nuevos aspectos acerca de las propiedades de la estabilidad en ecosistemas lacustres someros basados en estudios, experimentales o de modelizacion, de los aportes de materia organica de origen terrestre, tanto disuelta (tDOM) como particulada (tPOM). Estos estudios sugieren que la probabilidad de que los lagos someros cambien hacia o permanezcan en un estado de aguas turbias, aumenta con la predictibilidad futura de un incremento en los aportes de tDOM y tPOM. Todavia existen muchas incognitas en la restauracion de lagos someros, como la disponibilidad y dispersion de propagulos para el restablecimiento de una vegetacion diversa de macrofitos sumergidos. Sin embargo, la importancia de los cambios en el estado del lago esta cada vez mas demostrada en trabajos que cuantifican las consecuencias para la produccion primaria, las emisiones y el secuestro de carbono. EnglishFeedback mechanisms between macrophytes and water clarity resulting in the occurrence of alternative stable states have been described in a theoretical concept for shallow lakes. Here, I review recent studies applying the concept to other freshwater systems, unravelling stabilizing mechanisms and discussing consequences of regime shifts. Recent modelling studies predict that abrupt changes between clear and turbid water states can also occur in lowland rivers, both in time and in space. These findings were supported by long-term data from rivers in Spain and Germany. A deep lake model revealed that submerged macrophytes may also significantly reduce phytoplankton biomass by 50-15% in 100-11 m deep and oligotrophic lakes. Some of the mechanisms stabilizing clear-water conditions are still far from fully understood. Available data suggest that the macrophyte community composition affects number and type of mechanisms stabilizing clear-water conditions. Allelopathic effects of macrophytes on phytoplankton are no longer doubted, however, bacterial colonization of macrophytes and phytoplankton, phytoplankton interactions, local adaptations and strain-specific sensitivities have been found to modulate these interactions. New aspects on stability properties of shallow lake ecosystems arose from experimental and modelling studies on terrestrial organic matter input, both in dissolved (tDOM) and particulate (tPOM) form. These suggest that the likelihood that shallow lakes will shift to or stay in the turbid state is enhanced with a predicted future increase in tDOM and tPOM input. Shallow lake restoration still suffers from knowledge gaps such as the role of propagule availability and dispersal for the re-establishment of a diverse submerged macrophyte vegetation. The importance of lake regime shifts, however, is increasingly supported by studies on quantitative consequences for processes such as primary production, carbon emissions and carbon burial.

TI  - Hatching under brownification: DOC-mediated changes in physical, but not chemical properties of water affect hatching patterns of Cladocera resting eggs.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is often related to the brownification of water in continental aquatic systems and to changes in the physiology of zooplankton organisms. Zooplankton resting eggs are particularly sensitive to changes in light and chemical characteristics of water, but the physical and chemical effects associated to DOC on dormant stages have never been tested before. Herein, we tested how DOC affects hatching rates and time to hatching of Cladocera (Diaphanosoma birgei) resting eggs. In order to analyze the chemical (i.e., toxic) and physical (i.e., light attenuation) effects of DOC on hatching patterns, resting eggs were exposed to different concentrations of DOC (0, 50, and 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) in an experimental design which isolated chemical from physical effects. When evaluating the physical effects of DOC, hatching was more than 150% less in 100 than 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC and time to hatching was 66% lesser in 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC than control. Hatchling numbers and time to hatching were not affected by DOC chemical effects. We conclude DOC effects on hatching mainly relied on light attenuation, while chemical effects were likely of minor importance. DOC may change Cladocera emergence patterns mainly through light attenuation in the water column.

TI  - DOM quality in a peatland and forest headwater stream: seasonal and event characteristics
PY  - 2016
AB  - Peatlands and peaty riparian zones are major sources of DOM, but are poorly understood in terms of export dynamics and controls thereof. The quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in discharge from a bog and 10 a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA254), apparent molecular size (SR) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. The forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in concentrations and quality 15 compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog. During snowmelt and spring events surface-near protein-like DOM pools were exported. During drought a microbial DOM fraction originating from groundwater and deep peat layers was exported, characterized by high FI, high SR and increasing humic-like fluorophores C1% or C4%. During discharge events this deep sourced DOM pool was diluted by humic-rich surface-near DOM pools, which were more aromatic, also of microbial origin with high FI and SR, and an increase in humic-like fluorophores C2% and C3% at the forested site. The FI suggested export 20 of DOM of strong microbial alteration particularly under discharge events with dry preconditions. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site. Our study demonstrated that DOM export dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but assessing DOM quality can greatly improve our understanding of DOM sources and their response under different hydrological preconditions.

TI  - Predicted warming and browning affect timing and magnitude of plankton phenological events in lakes: a mesocosm study
PY  - 2012
AB  - 1. Aquatic ecosystems in Northern Europe are expected to face increases in temperature and water colour (TB) in future. While effects of these factors have been studied separately, it is unknown whether and how a combination of them might affect phenological events and trophic interactions. 2. In a mesocosm study, we combined both factors to create conditions expected to arise during the coming century. We focused on quantifying effects on timing and magnitude of plankton spring phenological events and identifying possible mismatches between resources (phytoplankton) and consumers (zooplankton). 3. We found that the increases in TB had important effects on timing and abundance of different plankton groups. While increased temperature led to an earlier peak in phytoplankton and zooplankton and a change in the relative timing of different zooplankton groups, increased water colour reduced chlorophyll-a concentrations. 4. Increased TB together benefitted cladocerans and calanoid copepods and led to stronger top-down control of algae by zooplankton. There was no sign of a mismatch between primary producers and grazers as reported from other studies. 5. Our results point towards an earlier onset of plankton spring growth in shallow lakes in future with a stronger top-down control of phytoplankton by zooplankton grazers. (Less)

TI  - Dissolved carbon in a large variety of lakes across five limnetic regions in China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Dissolved carbon in lakes play a vital role in the global carbon cycling. The concentration and dynamics of lake dissolved carbon can be inﬂuenced by both the surrounding landscape and a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes within the lakes themselves. From 2009 to 2016, we conducted a large-scale assessment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in 249 lakes across a diverse range of climatic, geopedologic, topographical and hydrological conditions in ﬁve Chinese limnetic regions: the East Limnetic Region (ELR), the Northeast Limnetic Region (NLR), the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region (MXR), the Yungui Limnetic Region (YGR), and the Tibet-Qinghai Limnetic Region (TQR). We found that the density of the organic matter in the soil in the surrounding landscape plays an important role in the DOC and DIC in lake water, as was evidenced by the high DOC and DIC levels in the NLR, where the soil is respectively organically rich. Conditions in the arid and semi-arid environments (i.e. TQR and MXR) have created a number of brackish/saline lakes and here we found that, DOC and DIC levels (median: 21.79 and 93.72 mg/L, respectively) are signiﬁcantly higher than those in the freshwater lakes (median: 5.80 and 29.38 mg/L). It also appears to be the case that the trophic state of freshwater lakes inﬂuences the spatial variation of DOC. This can be seen in the relationships between DOC and trophic state index (TSI) in agriculturally-dominated regions such as the ELR (R2 = 0.59, p < 0.01), NLR (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.001), and YGR (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Additionally, a close relationship between DOC and DIC can be found in lake waters with diﬀerent trophic states (eutrophic: slp = 0.63, R2= 0.69; mesotrophic: slp = 1.03, R2 = 0.65; oligotrophic: slp = 1.00, R2 = 0.64). This indicates that human activities inﬂuence the quantity and quality of dissolved carbon in inland water across China. This study is able to provide insights regarding the potential eﬀects of climate change and changes in land-use upon the amount of dissolved carbon in lake water.

TI  - CONSEQUENCES OF SALINIZATION ON CARBON AND NUTRIENT RELEASE FROM A RESTORED COASTAL FORESTED WETLAND
PY  - 2016
AB  - Given that wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as improving water quality and protecting inland regions from storms, it is necessary to understand how sea level rise and climate change will alter their structure and function. Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle, thus much work has focused on how they will respond to climatic change. One aspect that has not received much attention is how increasing salinity, due to drought and sea level rise, alters the export of dissolved organic carbon and the process of flocculation. This study combined long-term field observations, laboratory assays, and a field experiment to examine the effects of salinity on the process of flocculation and the subsequent fate of particulate organic carbon (POC). I compiled long-term field data to determine control mechanisms on POC concentration. To assess the effects of salinity and floc reversibility, I conducted a lab assay. I also conducted a field saltwater addition with adapted sediment traps to determine if salt induced flocculation and changes in water clarity and nutrients. I then determined the bioavailability of the floc for heterotrophic microbial respiration. In the long-term field data, salinity did not enter the site and POC formation was variable and was weakly correlated to nitrate. In the lab assays, salinity induced POC formation and resulted in an increase in light penetration, and the floc did not re-dissolve after a simulated storm event. In the field experiment, salt addition induced flocculation and established a potential mechanism for phosphorus retention. DOC was converted to recalcitrant POC, reducing bioavailability for microbial respiration, which led to increased floc deposition. Salinity mobilized nitrogen and stimulated algal biomass production. My results suggest that saltwater intrusion could increase organic sediment accumulation in wetlands with high DOC loads and increase the potential for algal blooms in legacy impacted wetlands with low flows. My results suggest that increased salinity to freshwater wetlands could reduce carbon export and increase soil accretion rates, increasing ecosystem resilience to low salinity perturbations.

TI  - Altered energy flow in the food web of an experimentally darkened lake
PY  - 2015
AB  - Theory suggests that alternative resources may begin to support a food web when highly used resources become less available relative to alternatives. To test the potential for alternative resources to support consumers, we experimentally darkened a lake whose consumers had relied heavily on algal resources (phytoplankton and benthic algae). We estimated the support consumers received from resources before and after darkening using a Bayesian mixing model and stables isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Between a prior year and the darkened year, phytoplankton biomass diminished by 60%, and surface dissolved oxygen saturation, pCO2, and net ecosystem production indicated a shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Although a specialist copepod maintained a high reliance on phytoplankton after darkening, a generalist zooplankton predator (Chaoborus spp.) derived more support from terrestrial sources. Fishes received less support from benthic algae after darkening, and received greater support from float...

TI  - Determination of food sources for benthic invertebrates and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in Canadian Boreal Shield lakes using stable isotope analysis
PY  - 2012
AB  - Allochthonous inputs can be an important contribution of organic matter in lake eco- systems. Yet, our understanding of the patterns of energy dependence of littoral invertebrates and fish is poor. We measured carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) stable isotope values for primary pro- ducers, terrestrial detritus, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in 8 oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes to determine food sources that support benthic consumers and brook trout. Mixing models used to determine animal diets from stable iso- tope analysis showed leaf litter to be the principal food source for benthic primary consumers in 6 out of 8 lakes. Brook trout derived its carbon mainly from benthic predatory macroinvertebrates in all lakes, with a contribution ranging from 60 to 90%. Zooplankton also contributed to brook trout diet in 3 of 8 lakes, ranging from 28 to 37%. δ 15 N increased from primary producers to consumers at different trophic positions in all lakes. Nitrogen isotopic signatures of brook trout became more positive with increasing fish length, indicating a change in fish foraging strategy related to size. Our study (1) suggests that carbon from terrestrial habitat (leaf litter) may contribute significantly to the food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes and (2) highlights the importance of carbon originating from benthic habitats in supporting brook trout in these lakes.

TI  - The importance of freshwater systems to the net atmospheric exchange ofcarbon dioxide and methane with a rapidly changing high Arctic watershed
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract. A warming climate is rapidly changing the distribution and exchanges of carbon within high Arctic ecosystems. Few data exist, however, which quantify exchange of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) between the atmosphere and freshwater systems, or estimate freshwater contributions to total catchment exchange of these gases, in the high Arctic. During the summers of 2005 and 2007–2012, we quantified CO2 and CH4 concentrations in, and atmospheric exchange with, common freshwater systems in the high Arctic watershed of Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada. We identified four types of biogeochemically distinct freshwater systems in the watershed; however mean CO2 concentrations (21–28 µmol L−1) and atmospheric exchange (−0.013 to +0.046 g C–CO2 m−2 day−1) were similar between these systems. Seasonal flooding of ponds bordering Lake Hazen generated considerable CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (+0.008 g C–CH4 m−2 day−1), while all other freshwater systems were minimal emitters of this gas (

TI  - Light availability regulates the response of algae and heterotrophic bacteria to elevated nutrient levels and warming in a northern boreal peatland
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary Light attenuation associated with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter (i.e. browning) is likely to affect the response of benthic biofilms to nutrient enrichment and warmer temperatures expected for northern aquatic ecosystems with climate change. To examine how these factors will interact to regulate the association between algae and heterotrophic bacteria in northern peatlands, we manipulated light (100%, 60%, 30%, 20% and 5% of ambient), nutrients (unenriched, enriched) and temperature (ambient, warming), in a full factorial design by shading nutrient diffusing substrates inside mesocosms with or without warming (3 °C) in an Alaskan fen. After 12 days of experimental conditions, there was no effect of light or temperature on the abundance of algae or bacteria in the absence of nutrient enrichment. Enrichment with a combination of nitrogen and phosphorus significantly increased the abundance of algae and heterotrophic bacteria at ambient light levels (418 μmol m−2 s−1), and warming significantly enhanced the positive effects of nutrients on algal accrual. Although warming enhanced the effects of nutrient enrichment on bacterial growth, the magnitude of the effect was not statistically significant compared to nutrient enrichment alone. The positive influence of nutrient enrichment and the synergistic effects of nutrients and warming on algae and bacteria were lost at ≤30% ambient light (below 125 μmol m−2 s−1). We conducted a separate laboratory incubation using recirculating water baths maintained at either ambient or elevated water temperature (warming of 5 °C) to evaluate the effects of warming on the use of algal exudates by heterotrophic bacteria. During the 16-day assay, the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria increased rapidly in the presence of a common solution of algal exudates and the rate of exudate assimilation by bacteria was significantly enhanced by warming compared with ambient temperature. The positive association between light availability and heterotrophic bacteria, coupled with accelerated bacterial growth in the presence of algal exudates, support bacterial dependence on algal subsidies in the presence of recalcitrant organic substrates in this northern peatland. Within a predictive context, our results demonstrate that greater light attenuation associated with browning of surface water may reduce the positive influence of warmer temperatures and elevated nutrient levels on the microbial loop by reducing algal production on submerged surfaces in northern peatlands.

TI  - Under Ice and Early Summer Phytoplankton Dynamics in Two Arctic Lakes with Differing DOC
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We investigated Arctic lake phytoplankton response along vertical gradients in the water column during seasonal succession from ice‐covered to open‐water conditions. Two oligotrophic lakes in West Greenland with different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were selected. We assessed which factors: (1) promote under‐ice growth of phytoplankton, and (2) trigger shifts in the community structure. Our results suggest that DOC is an important driver of the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton biomass—high DOC exacerbates light limitation under ice resulting in low phytoplankton biomass, but supports phytoplankton growth during the open‐water period when photolytic and biological degradation of organic matter contributes to the pool of available nutrients. Under‐ice phytoplankton biomass in a clear, low DOC lake was as high as during the open‐water period, suggesting the importance of under‐ice processes for lake metabolic balance, also evidenced by persistent oxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Species composition was dynamic, reflecting rapidly changing conditions over the course of the season. Our data suggest that phytoplankton under ice provides seed populations for early spring blooms and that the largest shifts in species composition occur later during the summer, likely as a result of nutrient depletion and intensified grazing pressure. Early spring temperatures in West Greenland have risen rapidly in recent decades, triggering shifts in the timing of lake ice‐out and the onset of stratification; therefore, it is important to understand phytoplankton seasonal dynamics to disentangle the effects of climate‐driven shifts on aquatic biota.</jats:p>

TI  - Indirect versus Direct Effects of Freshwater Browning on Larval Fish Foraging
PY  - 2019
AB  - O_LIThe larval stage in fish development is characterized as a critical period with unusually high mortality rates. Additional stress may be imposed on fish larvae as fresh waters brown in color due to increased inputs of dissolved organic matter from the terrestrial watershed. Both energy transfer and foraging efficacy are predicted to decrease as light availability declines with browning.nC_LIO_LIHere, we investigated the balance between indirect versus direct effects of browning on zooplankton-larval fish interactions. Experimental tanks were established in the laboratory where water color was altered with increasing concentrations of SuperHume (water color measured as absorbance at 440 nm = 1.6 - 10.8 m-1). Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were monitored across treatments for one month to assess possible changes in community structure leading up to fish spawning (i.e., late Spring in central Virginia, USA). We then introduced larval largemouth bass to the tanks to assess indirect effects on larval fish feeding rate and growth. Additionally, direct effects on the foraging efficiency and selectivity of largemouth bass and bluegill were determined with separate short-term feeding experiments using the same experimental setup.nC_LIO_LIBrowning did not directly alter the ability of larval fish to see and capture prey across our brown water treatments. However, significant indirect effects on larval fish foraging, growth, and survival were observed as phytoplankton and zooplankton densities decreased with increasing water color.nC_LIO_LIOur data suggest lake browning will reduce energy transfer to larval fish, during a critical stage of development, due to a reduction in prey availability but not visual foraging.nC_LI

TI  - Whole-Lake Sugar Addition Demonstrates Trophic Transfer of Dissolved Organic Carbon to Top Consumers
PY  - 2017
AB  - Terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) provides an external carbon source to lake ecosystems. However, there is ongoing debate about whether external DOC that enters a lake can pass up the food web to support top consumers. We show, from experimental manipulation of a whole lake, that externally loaded DOC can contribute appreciably to fish biomass. Monthly additions of cane sugar with a distinct carbon stable isotope value during 2 years rapidly enriched the 13C content of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, with a more gradual 13C enrichment of fish. After sugar addition stopped, the 13C content of consumers reverted towards original values. A simple isotope mixing model indicated that by the end of the sugar addition almost 20% of fish carbon in the lake was derived from the added sugar. Our results provide the first direct experimental demonstration at relevant ecological spatial and temporal scales that externally loaded DOC to lakes can indeed transfer to top consumers.

AB  - <jats:p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of constant bright light on the cornea and retina of <jats:italic>Clarias gariepinus</jats:italic> (Burchell, 1822) and to examine whether it can change after constant exposure to dim light. Twenty-one adult individuals of <jats:italic>C. gariepinus</jats:italic> were divided into three groups (n = 7). The first group was maintained under normal light (NL). The second group was exposed to the intense bright light (BL) (3020 Lux) of white light lamps for seven days. The third group was exposed to dim light for seven days (DL) following the previous exposure to intense bright light for seven days. The eyes of each fish group were removed and fixed. The following aspects of the eye were investigated: histopathological, immunohistochemical (GFAP and BAX) staining and biochemical study for lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Also, isoenzyme electrophoresis of LDH, G6PDH and SOD were performed. The present study found that, seven-days BL exposure caused damage to both cornea and retina. However, after exposure to dim-light after bright light there was partial improvement in corneal and retinal structure and an increase in the assayed SOD and G6PDH levels, along with a reduction in MDA content and activity of LDH. These findings demonstrate a plasticity that may help <jats:italic>C. gariepinus</jats:italic> survive disturbances in the aquatic environment.</jats:p>

Recovery from acid rain is regarded as an important driver for this lake color increase, indicating a general browner lake color in preindustrial times. However, the lack of long-term monitoring data makes it challenging to unravel historical changes in lake color. In this study, we estimated long-term development in lake color (1800 to 2015) based on the optical properties of alkaline extractable dissolved organic matter (DOM) from sediment using UV–Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that the present lake color (2015) was significantly browner (four times higher in absorption coefficient) than for the period from 1800 to 1915 when lake color was at a lower and more stable level. Fluorescence excitation–emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) indicate that terrestrially derived DOM was the main source of sediment DOM. However, the importance of in-lake source of DOM has significantly increased with time. The long-term trend in DOM burial was not consistent with the anthropogenic sulfur (S) deposition pattern. However, along with the increased sediment DOM, there has been increased precipitation, temperature and forest growth with time, which affect the production and degradation of DOM. Even though S deposition might have delayed the runoff of terrestrial DOM for a certain period, it comes in addition to other color-regulating factors. Thus, there is no single driver for the observed lake browning, but rather an interplay between different drivers varying in strength over time, such as afforestation, changes in areal use, declined S deposition, and increased temperature and precipitation.

TI  - Reviewing phosphorus and nitrogen targets for the SSSI meres
PY  - 2010
AB  - 1. The meres in the North-West Midlands of England are a regional cluster of lakes of high conservation importance, yet impacted by high nutrient concentrations from surrounding land-use and population settlements. Despite their long-history of being in a eutrophic state, the most rapid enrichment and consequent changes to aquatic flora have occurred over the last 50-100 years. In many lowland temperate lakes, these changes have largely resulted from phosphorus enrichment and national legislation has set target concentrations for this element to prevent or reduce nutrient enrichment. However other nutrients, such as nitrogen, can also limit or co-limit productivity and is probably of more widespread importance than generally recognised, but currently no target concentrations exist for this nutrient. 2. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to: • review existing phosphorus target concentrations for 26 meres with SSSI status • assess the applicability of nitrogen target concentrations for these meres • recommend P and N target concentrations for the 26 SSSI meres • recommend further research to address data gaps and improve understanding and management of the meres. 3. The review considered key published and unpublished literature and recent work in setting P and chlorophyll standards for the Water Framework Directive. It also analysed data on current concentrations of nitrogen & phosphorus provided by the Environment Agency and macrophyte species provided by Natural England. 4. There is not a single way to assess nutrient-limitation so eight approaches were used: i) N:P ratios, ii) comparison of Chla: total phosphorus (TP) versus European average response, iii) comparison of Chla: total nitrogen (TN) versus European average response, iv) Chla:TP ratios, v) Chla:TN ratios, vi) seasonal minima of phosphate and nitrate, vii) modelling using a stoichiometric model ‘Metabolake and viii) direct bioassays. 5. Although nitrogen-limitation is becoming recognised as being more widespread then hitherto thought, in the case of the meres, the frequently high concentrations of TP caused by input from glacial deposits, low rates of TP loss caused by low flushing rates or lack of a distinct outflow coupled with potential loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere via denitrification will tend to favour nitrogen-limitation and this was reflected in the analysis. 6. The analyses indicated that at the 22 sites where data were available, 7 sites were mainly phosphorus-limited (32%), 8 sites were mainly nitrogen-limited (36%) and 7 sites were either mainly co-limited or not limited by nutrients (32%). Direct bioassay data showed that nutrient-limitation can vary over a year. 7. Nutrient targets are needed to manage water quality or achieve conservation objectives. They are not something essential of themselves. 8. Macrophyte diversity, a possible conservation objective, does not appear to relate to nutrient availability in the meres, possibly because most of the meres have relatively high nutrient concentrations and possibly because the macrophyte populations have adapted to these concentrations over many decades. Total number of species vs nitrate in the meres is not markedly different from the UK data-set used to establish the relationship between macrophyte diversity and nitrogen so this is unlikely to be the cause of the lack of a relationship. 9. In terms of setting targets, many of the meres have high alkalinities so high-baseline targets for TP would be expected. Site-specific Water Framework Directive TP targets for the meres at the High/ Good boundary range from 14 µg L-1 for Oak Mere (low alkalinity) to 46 µg L-1 for Quoisley Little Mere. The Good/ Moderate boundary targets range from 21 to 57 µg L-1. These concentrations are generally below the inferred TP concentrations from around 1850 which range between 31 and 50 µg L-1 at the five sites where cores have been analysed. Consequently, even Good/ Moderate Water Framework Directive targets may not be achievable. 10. The presence of nitrogen limitation or co-limitation in the meres means that nitrogen targets are also appropriate at some of the sites. Total nitrogen targets were derived from European datasets relating concentrations of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen for different types of lakes. In turn, the chlorophyll a target was derived from Water Framework Directive standards for different lake types. The Good/ Moderate total nitrogen target varied between 0.4 mg to 1.4 mg L-1. 11. Where possible, mere-specific targets are preferable to general targets, but these require better data to implement. A range of different future projects addressing data gaps and uncertainty over the functioning of the meres are suggested. In particular, the role of trophic-interactions, for example grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton and control of zooplankton by fish, in moderating water quality needs to be assessed and managed.

TI  - Phytoremediation Systems for the Recovery of Nutrients from Eutrophic Waters
PY  - 2013
AB  - Eutrophication and availability of freshwater for human consumption is one of the main issues in front of the environmentalists. Eutrophication, acidification, and contamination by toxic substances are posing a threat to the freshwater resources and ecosystems. The consequence of anthropogenic-induced eutrophication of freshwater has resulted in severe deterioration of surface water. Effective control measures need to be taken in order to control eutrophication and restore eutrophic water bodies. In this row, phytoremediation is emerging as a simple low-cost clean up technology for wastewater. Phytoremediation is defined as the engineered use of green plants to remove, or render harmless, various environmental contaminates such as inorganic and organic compounds. Development of aquatic plant systems for nutrient recovery from eutrophic water is essentially required to control eutrophication. The performance of phytoremediation system depends upon many factors such as growth performances of the plants selected for phytoremediation, their nutrients removal potential, efficiency to grow in experimental environment. In order to develop high-efficient nutrients phytoremediation systems aquatic plant species in combinations (mono, bi, tri species culture) can be used. Sufficient work has been done and huge amount of capital is invested so far for the restoration of some major water bodies that are falling under direct threat of eutrophication but the results are unsatisfactorily.

TI  - Intra-annual variability of organic carbon concentrations in running waters : Drivers along a climatic gradient
PY  - 2014
AB  - Trends in surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have received considerable scientific interest during recent decades. However, intra-annual DOC variability is often orders of magnitude larger than long-term trends. Unraveling the controls on intra-annual DOC dynamics holds the key to a better understanding of long-term changes and their ecological significance. We quantified and characterized intra-annual DOC variability and compared it with long-term DOC trends in 136 streams and rivers, varying in size and geographical characteristics, across a 1400 km latitudinal gradient during 2000–2010. Discharge, temperature, and month of the year were the most significant predictors of intra-annual DOC variability in a majority of the running waters. Relationships between DOC, discharge, and temperature were, however, different along a mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient. Running waters with low MAT generally displayed positive DOC-discharge correlations whereas the relationships in sites with higher MAT were more variable. This reflected contrasting relationships between temperature and discharge with discharge positively correlated with temperature in cold areas, while it was negatively correlated with temperature in catchments with higher MAT. Sites where flow, temperature, and month were poorly related to intra-annual DOC dynamics were large catchments or sites with extensive upstream lake cover. DOC trends were generally much smaller than intra-annual DOC variability and did not show any north-south gradient. Our findings suggest that DOC in running waters could respond to a changing climate in ways not predictable, or even discernible, from extrapolation of recent interannual trends.

TI  - Centers of endemism of freshwater protists deviate from pattern of taxon richness on a continental scale.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Here, we analyzed patterns of taxon richness and endemism of freshwater protists in Europe. Even though the significance of physicochemical parameters but also of geographic constraints for protist distribution is documented, it remains unclear where regional areas of high protist diversity are located and whether areas of high taxon richness harbor a high proportion of endemics. Further, patterns may be universal for protists or deviate between taxonomic groups. Based on amplicon sequencing campaigns targeting the SSU and ITS region of the rDNA we address these patterns at two different levels of phylogenetic resolution. Our analyses demonstrate that protists have restricted geographical distribution areas. For many taxonomic groups the regions of high taxon richness deviate from those having a high proportion of putative endemics. In particular, the diversity of high mountain lakes as azonal habitats deviated from surrounding lowlands, i.e. many taxa were found exclusively in high mountain lakes and several putatively endemic taxa occurred in mountain regions like the Alps, the Pyrenees or the Massif Central. Beyond that, taxonomic groups showed a pronounced accumulation of putative endemics in distinct regions, e.g. Dinophyceae along the Baltic Sea coastline, and Chrysophyceae in Scandinavia. Many other groups did not have pronounced areas of increased endemism but geographically restricted taxa were found across Europe.

TI  - Antagonistic effects of temperature and dissolved organic carbon on fish growth in California mountain lakes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Resources and temperature play major roles in determining biological production in lake ecosystems. Lakes have been warming and ‘browning’ over recent decades due to climate change and increased loading of terrestrial organic matter. Conflicting hypotheses and evidence have been presented about whether these changes will increase or decrease fish growth within lakes. Most studies have been conducted in low-elevation lakes where terrestrially derived carbon tends to dominate over carbon produced within lakes. Understanding how fish in high-elevation mountain lakes will respond to warming and browning is particularly needed as warming effects are magnified for mountain lakes and treeline is advancing to higher elevations. We sampled 21 trout populations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California to examine how body condition and individual growth rates, measured by otolith analysis, varied across independent elevational gradients in temperature and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We found that fish grew faster at warmer temperatures and higher nitrogen (TN), but slower in high DOC lakes. Additionally, fish showed better body condition in lakes with higher TN, higher elevation and when they exhibited a more terrestrial δ13C isotopic signature. The future warming and browning of lakes will likely have antagonistic impacts on fish growth, reducing the predicted independent impact of warming and browning alone.

PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Shifts in the composition of terrestrial plant communities could have significant effects on freshwater zooplankton due to changes in the quality of inputs of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Leachate from native red maple (RM) and invasive Amur honeysuckle (AH) were used to explore the effects of DOM source on survival and growth of juvenile Daphnia ambigua. Prior research with both terrestrial and aquatic organisms indicates that AH-derived DOM has negative effects. Comparing bioassays in the presence and absence of algae with no additional DOM, RM- or AH-derived DOM, RM had stronger negative effects on both Daphnia survival and growth while AH only decreased growth. The negative effects seen in the presence and absence of algae provided evidence for both indirect and direct effects due to phytotoxicity and plant secondary compounds, respectively. DOM source may play a key role in regulating consumers in aquatic ecosystems.</jats:p>

TI  - Towards modeling data-poor lakes at the regional scale using parameters from data-rich lakes and relationships to lake characteristics.
PY  - 2023
AB  - AbstractLakes that are pivotal for recreation and economically relevant activities are often remote and not very well studied, which hinders the application of predictive lake models for their management. Here, we provide an approach to simulate, by means of the process-oriented model MyLake, water temperature, ice cover duration, dissolved oxygen, and light attenuation in 198 data-poor lakes based on parameters obtained for a subgroup of 12 data-rich lakes and morphometric data. Specifically, the model is first calibrated using a genetic algorithm on well-studied lakes. Then, simple relationships between the fitted parameters and lake-catchment morphometric properties are derived. The results of simulations using fitted and derived parameters are then compared. The loss in goodness-of-fit, expressed as root mean square error (RMSE), incurred by using estimated rather than calibrated parameters, is 0.17 oC for water temperature and 0.82 mg L-1 for dissolved oxygen. These general relationships are then used to provide the model parameters for 198 data-poor lakes distributed throughout Sweden and model these lakes. Overall, this proof of concept allows simulating lakes selected based on their relevance for lake management rather than based on the availability of extensive field datasets.Keywords: LakesLake modelingoxythermal habitatsclimate change impactmodel calibrationdata-poor lakesDisclaimerAs a service to authors and researchers we are providing this version of an accepted manuscript (AM).

TI  - Depth and basin shape constrain ecosystem metabolism in lakes dominated by benthic primary producers
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Metabolism is one of the most fundamental ecosystem processes, but the drivers of variation in metabolic rates among lakes dominated by benthic primary producers remain poorly constrained. Here, we report the magnitudes and potential drivers of whole‐lake metabolism across 43 Swedish arctic–alpine lakes, based on the free‐water diel oxygen technique with sondes deployed during the open‐water season near the surface and bottom of the lakes. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) were strongly coupled and ranged from 0.06 to 0.45 mg and 0.05 to 0.43 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> among lakes. On average, GPP and R decreased eightfold from relatively shallow to deep lakes (mean depth 0.5–10.9 m) and twofold from concave to convex lakes (mean depth: maximum depth 0.2–0.5). We attribute this to light limitation and shape‐specific sensitivity of benthic GPP to disturbance by lake ice. Net ecosystem production (GPP‐R) ranged from −0.09 to 0.14 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and switched, on average, from positive to negative towards deeper lakes and lakes richer in dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 0.5–7.4 mg DOC L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Uncertainties in metabolism estimates were high (around one and three times mean R and GPP), especially in deep lakes with low insulation and diurnally variable wind speed. Our results confirm the role of DOC in stimulating net heterotrophy and highlight novel effects of lake shape on productivity in benthic‐dominated lake ecosystems and its response to changes in lake ice cover.</jats:p>

TI  - Importance of coastal primary production in the northern Baltic Sea
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this study, we measured depth-dependent benthic microalgal primary production in a Bothnian Bay estuary to estimate the benthic contribution to total primary production. In addition, we compiled data on benthic microalgal primary production in the entire Baltic Sea. In the estuary, the benthic habitat contributed 17 % to the total annual primary production, and when upscaling our data to the entire Bothnian Bay, the corresponding value was 31 %. This estimated benthic share (31 %) is three times higher compared to past estimates of 10 %. The main reason for this discrepancy is the lack of data regarding benthic primary production in the northern Baltic Sea, but also that past studies overestimated the importance of pelagic primary production by not correcting for system-specific bathymetric variation. Our study thus highlights the importance of benthic communities for the northern Baltic Sea ecosystem in general and for future management strategies and ecosystem studies in particular.

TI  - A source of terrestrial organic carbon to investigate the browning of aquatic ecosystems.
PY  - 2013
AB  - There is growing evidence that terrestrial ecosystems are exporting more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems than they did just a few decades ago. This “browning” phenomenon will alter the chemistry, physics, and biology of inland water bodies in complex and difficult-to-predict ways. Experiments provide an opportunity to elucidate how browning will affect the stability and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. However, it is challenging to obtain sources of DOC that can be used for manipulations at ecologically relevant scales. In this study, we evaluated a commercially available source of humic substances (“Super Hume”) as an analog for natural sources of terrestrial DOC. Based on chemical characterizations, comparative surveys, and whole-ecosystem manipulations, we found that the physical and chemical properties of Super Hume are similar to those of natural DOC in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, Super Hume attenuated solar radiation in ways that will not only influence the physiology of aquatic taxa but also the metabolism of entire ecosystems. Based on its chemical properties (high lignin content, high quinone content, and low C:N and C:P ratios), Super Hume is a fairly recalcitrant, low-quality resource for aquatic consumers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that Super Hume can subsidize aquatic food webs through 1) the uptake of dissolved organic constituents by microorganisms, and 2) the consumption of particulate fractions by larger organisms (i.e., Daphnia). After discussing some of the caveats of Super Hume, we conclude that commercial sources of humic substances can be used to help address pressing ecological questions concerning the increased export of terrestrial DOC to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Changing lake water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations are of concern for lake management because of corresponding effects on aquatic ecosystem functioning, drinking water resources and carbon cycling between land and sea. Understanding the importance of human activities on TOC changes requires knowledge of past concentrations; however, water-monitoring data are typically only available for the past few decades, if at all. Here, we present a universal model to infer past lake water TOC concentrations in northern lakes across Europe and North America that uses visible-near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy on lake sediments. In the orthogonal partial least-squares model, VNIR spectra of surface-sediment samples are calibrated against corresponding surface water TOC concentrations (0.5–41 mg L–1) from 345 Arctic to northern temperate lakes in Canada, Greenland, Sweden and Finland. Internal model-cross-validation resulted in a R2 of 0.57 and a prediction error of 4.4 mg TOC L–1. First applications to lakes...

TI  - Photoautotrophic nutrient utilization and limitation during semi-continuous growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
PY  - 2010
AB  - Microbial photosynthesis presents a valuable opportunity to capture abundant light energy to produce renewable bioenergy and biomaterials. To understand the factors that control the productivity of photosynthetic microorganisms, we conducted a series of semi-continuous experiments using bench-scale photobioreactor (PBR) systems, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 (PCC6803), and light conditions imitating actual day-night light irradiance (LI). Our results demonstrate that using normal BG-11 medium resulted in severe phosphate (P(i)) limitation for continuous operation. Mitigation of P(i)-limitation, by augmenting the P(i) content of BG-11, allowed higher biomass productivity; however, once P(i)-limitation was alleviated, limitation by inorganic carbon (C(i)) or LI occurred. C(i)-limitation was detected by a low total C(i) concentration (<5 mg C/L) and high and fluctuating pH. C(i)-limitation was relieved by delivering more CO(2), which led to a stable pH in the range of 7-9 and at least 5 mg/L of C(i) in HCO(3)(-). LI limitation, evidenced by an average LI <14 W/m(2) for PCC6803, was induced by a high biomass concentration of 1,300 mg/L. Thus, this work provides quantitative tools of stoichiometry and kinetics to evaluate limitation on PBRs.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen enrichment on zooplankton biomass and N:P recycling ratios across a DOC gradient in northern-latitude lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We used data from whole-lake studies to assess how changes in food quantity (phytoplankton biomass) and quality (phytoplankton community composition, seston C:P and N:P) with N fertilization affect zooplankton biomass, community composition and C:N:P stoichiometry, and their N:P recycling ratio along a gradient in lake DOC concentrations. We found that despite major differences in phytoplankton biomass with DOC (unimodal distributions, especially with N fertilization), no major differences in zooplankton biomass were detectable. Instead, phytoplankton to zooplankton biomass ratios were high, especially at intermediate DOC and after N fertilization, implying low trophic transfer efficiencies. An explanation for the observed low phytoplankton resource use, and biomass responses in zooplankton, was dominance of colony forming chlorophytes of reduced edibility at intermediate lake DOC, combined with reduced phytoplankton mineral quality (enhanced seston N:P) with N fertilization. N fertilization, however, increased zooplankton N:P recycling ratios, with largest impact at low DOC where phytoplankton benefitted from light sufficiently to cause enhanced seston N:P. Our results suggest that although N enrichment and increased phytoplankton biomass do not necessarily increase zooplankton biomass, bottom-up effects may still impact zooplankton and their N:P recycling ratio through promotion of phytoplankton species of low edibility and altered mineral quality.</jats:p>

TI  - Investigating Temporal Variation of Water Quality and Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Taudaha Lake, Kathmandu, Nepal
PY  - 2016
AB  - Taudaha Lake is one of the important wetlands in Nepal, as it provides critical habitats for thousands of migratory birds and fishes. Despite being a critically important water body, there is a lack of detail chemical and biological studies on this lake. The present study investigates the effects of seasonal water quality variations in distribution and abundance of macroinvertebrates in Taudaha Lake, during four different seasons in 2006. The results indicate that all the water quality parameters, except secchi depth, and total alkalinity, significantly varied among seasons. The gross primary productivity of the lake also significantly varied among the seasons, with highest primary production during summer (3.92 ± 0.18 gC/m3/day) and lowest during spring (2.44 ± 0.67 gC/m3/day). A total of 2166 individual benthic macroinvertebrates from 10 families and 7 orders were collected during the study period. Unlike water quality parameters, the macroinvertebrate species composition did not vary significantly among the seasons. The results suggested that the change in lake water quality did not have significant impacts on community metrics such as species diversity, species richness, and species evenness.

TI  - Challenges in assessing biological recovery from acidification in Swedish lakes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Since the 1980s, Swedish lakes have in general become less acidified. Assessment of biological recovery is, however, hampered by poor pre-acidification data, confounding effects of climate change, and few lakes with annual sampling of fish and other organisms. Only three critically acidified, but non-limed, lakes had two decades of fish monitoring. The lakes had not yet recovered to pre-industrial chemical targets. Fish had low species richness compared to other organism groups. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) and/or European perch (Perca fluviatilis) were the dominant fish species, and the acid-sensitive roach had been lost from one of the lakes. Calcium decreased, possibly approaching pre-acidification concentrations, but exceeded minimum levels needed to sustain some Daphnia species. High or increasing levels of total organic carbon, likely due to reduced acidification and climate change, might influence the biological communities in unexpected ways, for example, facilitating more frequent occurrence of the invasive algae Gonyostomum semen.

TI  - Viruses direct carbon cycling in lake sediments under global change.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Global change is altering the vast amount of carbon cycled by microbes between land and freshwater, but how viruses mediate this process is poorly understood. Here, we show that viruses direct carbon cycling in lake sediments, and these impacts intensify with future changes in water clarity and terrestrial organic matter (tOM) inputs. Using experimental tOM gradients within sediments of a clear and a dark boreal lake, we identified 156 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), of which 21% strongly increased with abundances of key bacteria and archaea, identified via metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MAGs included the most abundant prokaryotes, which were themselves associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Increased abundances of virus-like particles were separately associated with reduced bacterial metabolism and with shifts in DOM toward amino sugars, likely released by cell lysis rather than higher molecular mass compounds accumulating from reduced tOM degradation. An additional 9.6% of vOTUs harbored auxiliary metabolic genes associated with DOM and GHGs. Taken together, these different effects on host dynamics and metabolism can explain why abundances of vOTUs rather than MAGs were better overall predictors of carbon cycling. Future increases in tOM quantity, but not quality, will change viral composition and function with consequences for DOM pools. Given their importance, viruses must now be explicitly considered in efforts to understand and predict the freshwater carbon cycle and its future under global environmental change.

TI  - Spatial Variation in Nutrient and Water Color Effects on Lake Chlorophyll at Macroscales.
PY  - 2016
AB  - The nutrient-water color paradigm is a framework to characterize lake trophic status by relating lake primary productivity to both nutrients and water color, the colored component of dissolved organic carbon. Total phosphorus (TP), a limiting nutrient, and water color, a strong light attenuator, influence lake chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL). But, these relationships have been shown in previous studies to be highly variable, which may be related to differences in lake and catchment geomorphology, the forms of nutrients and carbon entering the system, and lake community composition. Because many of these factors vary across space it is likely that lake nutrient and water color relationships with CHL exhibit spatial autocorrelation, such that lakes near one another have similar relationships compared to lakes further away. Including this spatial dependency in models may improve CHL predictions and clarify how well the nutrient-water color paradigm applies to lakes distributed across diverse landscape settings. However, few studies have explicitly examined spatial heterogeneity in the effects of TP and water color together on lake CHL. In this study, we examined spatial variation in TP and water color relationships with CHL in over 800 north temperate lakes using spatially-varying coefficient models (SVC), a robust statistical method that applies a Bayesian framework to explore space-varying and scale-dependent relationships. We found that TP and water color relationships were spatially autocorrelated and that allowing for these relationships to vary by individual lakes over space improved the model fit and predictive performance as compared to models that did not vary over space. The magnitudes of TP effects on CHL differed across lakes such that a 1 μg/L increase in TP resulted in increased CHL ranging from 2–24 μg/L across lake locations. Water color was not related to CHL for the majority of lakes, but there were some locations where water color had a positive effect such that a unit increase in water color resulted in a 2 μg/L increase in CHL and other locations where it had a negative effect such that a unit increase in water color resulted in a 2 μg/L decrease in CHL. In addition, the spatial scales that captured variation in TP and water color effects were different for our study lakes. Variation in TP–CHL relationships was observed at intermediate distances (~20 km) compared to variation in water color–CHL relationships that was observed at regional distances (~200 km). These results demonstrate that there are lake-to-lake differences in the effects of TP and water color on lake CHL and that this variation is spatially structured. Quantifying spatial structure in these relationships furthers our understanding of the variability in these relationships at macroscales and would improve model prediction of chlorophyll a to better meet lake management goals.

TI  - Evaluating common drivers for color, iron and organic carbon in Swedish watercourses
PY  - 2014
AB  - The recent browning (increase in color) of surface waters across much of the northern hemisphere has important implications for light climate, ecosystem functioning, and drinking water treatability. Using log-linear regressions and long-term (6–21 years) data from 112 Swedish watercourses, we identified temporal and spatial patterns in browning-related parameters [iron, absorbance, and total organic carbon (TOC)]. Flow variability and lakes in the catchment were major influences on all parameters. Co-variation between seasonal, discharge-related, and trend effects on iron, TOC, and absorbance were dependent on pH, landscape position, catchment size, latitude, and dominant land cover. Large agriculture-dominated catchments had significantly larger trends in iron, TOC, and water color than small forest catchments. Our results suggest that while similarities exist, no single mechanism can explain the observed browning but show that multiple mechanisms related to land cover, climate, and acidification history are responsible for the ongoing browning of surface waters.

TI  - The influence of natural dissolved organic matter on herbicide toxicity to marine microalgae is species-dependent.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Microalgae, which are the foundation of aquatic food webs, may be the indirect target of herbicides used for agricultural and urban applications. Microalgae also interact with other compounds from their environment, such as natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can itself interact with herbicides. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of natural DOM on the toxicity of three herbicides (diuron, irgarol and S-metolachlor), singly and in ternary mixtures, to two marine microalgae, Chaetoceros calcitrans and Tetraselmis suecica, in monospecific, non-axenic cultures. Effects on growth, photosynthetic efficiency (Ф’M) and relative lipid content were evaluated. The chemical environment (herbicide and nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic carbon and DOM optical properties) was also monitored to assess any changes during the experiments. The results show that, without DOM, the highest irgarol concentration (I0.5: 0.5 mg.L−1) and the strongest mixture (M2: irgarol 0.5 μg.L−1 + diuron 0.5 μg.L−1 + S-metolachlor 5.0 μg.L−1) significantly decreased all parameters for both species. Similar impacts were induced by I0.5 and M2 in C. calcitrans (around −56% for growth, −50% for relative lipid content and −28% for Ф’M), but a significantly higher toxicity of M2 was observed in T. suecica (−56% and −62% with I0.5 and M2 for growth, respectively), suggesting a possible interaction between molecules. With DOM added to the culture media, a significant inhibition of these three parameters was also observed with I0.5 and M2 for both species. Furthermore, DOM modulated herbicide toxicity, which was decreased for C. calcitrans (−51% growth at I0.5 and M2) and increased for T. suecica (-64% and −75% growth at I0.5 and M2, respectively). In addition to the direct and/or indirect (via their associated bacteria) use of molecules present in natural DOM, the characterization of the chemical environment showed that the toxic effects observed on microalgae were accompanied by modifications of DOM composition and the quantity of dissolved organic carbon excreted and/or secreted by microorganisms. This toxicity modulation in presence of DOM could be explained by (i) the modification of herbicide bioavailability, (ii) a difference in cell wall composition between the two species, and/or (iii) a higher detoxification capacity of C. calcitrans by the use of molecules contained in DOM. This study therefore demonstrated, for the first time, the major modulating role of natural DOM on the toxicity of herbicides to marine microalgae.

TI  - 13 Years of Storms: An Analysis of the Effects of Storms on Lake Physics on the Atlantic Fringe of Europe
PY  - 2020
AB  - While winter storms are generally common in western Europe, the rarer summer storms may result in more pronounced impacts on lake physics. Using long-term, high frequency datasets of weather and lake thermal structure from the west of Ireland (2005 to 2017), we quantified the effects of storms on the physical conditions in a monomictic, deep lake close to the Atlantic Ocean. We analysed a total of 227 storms during the stratified (May to September, n = 51) and non-stratified (November to March, n = 176) periods. In winter, as might be expected, changes were distributed over the entire water column, whereas in summer, when the lake was stratified, storms only impacted the smaller volume above the thermocline. During an average summer (May–September) storm, the lake number dropped by an order of magnitude, the thermocline deepened by an average of 2.8 m, water column stability decreased by an average of 60.4 j m−2 and the epilimnion temperature decreased by a factor of five compared to the average change in winter (0.5 °C vs. 0.1 °C). Projected increases in summer storm frequency will have important implications for lake physics and biological pathways.

TI  - Linkages between pelagic and benthic biota in a deteriorated coastal lake after restoration, Maruit, Egypt.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Until the 1960s, Lake Maruit was one of Egypt's most productive coastal brackish lakes. Continuous polluted discharge from Alexandria city resulted in long-term deterioration. The Egyptian government started a lake restoration program in 2010. Biological linkages between pelagic and benthic communities were assessed in November 2012 using parasitism and predation. This study examined ectoparasites infesting tilapia fish from 300 samples. The platyhelminth ectoparasite, Monogenea, and parasitic-copepod Ergasilus lizae were detected. Platyhelminthes parasitized Oreochromis niloticus and Oreochromis aureus, whereas the crustacean parasitized Coptodon zillii. The parasitic prevalence was low for Cichlidogyrus sp. and Ergasilus lizae. Benthic biotas were similar across basins. Fish abundance does not respond directly to benthic biotic components. Phytoplankton and benthic microalgae were not the main fish diet. Data on Halacaridae and fish clustered, indicating that either Halacaridae responds to their environment like fish or fish prey upon them because of their size. Linear correlations between pelagic, benthic biota, and parasite-infected fish indicate parasites may control their hosts. Some bioindicators indicate that stressed ecosystems differ from unstressed ecosystems. Fish species and biota abundances were low. Inconsistency in the food web and an absence of direct interactions between prey and predators are bioindicators of disturbed ecosystems. The low prevalence of ectoparasites and lack of heterogenous distribution of the various examined biota are bioindicators of habitat rehabilitation. Ongoing biomonitoring to better understand habitat rehabilitation is suggested.

TI  - Leaf litter species identity alters the structure of pond communities
PY  - 2015
AB  - The input of leaf litter resources is a major driver of ecosystem processes in terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Although variation exists in the quantity and composition of litter inputs due to natural and anthropogenic causes, few studies have examined how such variation influences the structure and composition of aquatic food webs. Using outdoor mesocosms, we examined the bottom–up effects of 10 chemically distinct tree litter species on microbial, algal, invertebrate and vertebrate fauna found in temperate ponds. We hypothesized that individual litter species, which differ in their traits, would differentially and predictably affect abiotic and biotic elements of pond communities. We further hypothesized that the presence of leaf litter, regardless of species, would elevate resource supply and increase the biomass of community members. Finally, we hypothesized that a mixture of litter species would have non-additive effects on community responses. We followed the system for > 4 months and measured > 30 abiotic and biotic responses related to primary and secondary production. The different species of leaf litter had major effects on abiotic and biotic responses, including phytoplankton, periphyton, zooplankton, snails, amphipods and tadpoles. Most biological responses were negatively associated with soluble carbon content of litter, or litter decay rate. Other litter traits, including phenolic concentrations and litter C:N were of secondary importance but did exhibit both positive and negative associations with several responses. The absence of litter had pervasive effects on abiotic attributes, but did not promote substantial changes in organism biomass. Most responses to the litter mixture were additive. Our results suggest that changes in temperate forest composition can strongly affect pond communities.

TI  - Human Activity Coupled With Climate Change Strengthens the Role of Lakes as an Active Pipe of Dissolved Organic Matter
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in lakes is controlled by multiple environmental drivers, but the relative importance of various drivers remains poorly understood at the continental scale. Here, we established a model resolving possible influencing pathways of climate, land cover, societal development, and water retention time of lakes on the quantity and quality of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) from 182 lakes spanning across strong climatic and economic gradients in China. Our results indicate that land cover and societal development both exhibit positive direct effects on lake CDOM quantity, highlighting the significant role of well‐vegetated soils and anthropogenic activities as sources of lake DOM on a continental scale. Climate has two strong but opposite effects—a warming and wet climate facilitates soil OM production and export, while it also enhances CDOM in‐lake transformation. Three proxies are proposed as indicators of the magnitude of biogeochemical drivers influencing lake DOM across different ecoclimatic zones, including fluorescent DOM/DOC indicating economic activity, percentages of a degraded fluorescent DOM component indicating solar irradiation, and percent tyrosine‐like DOM reflecting DOM processing time within the watershed and lake. Collectively, our findings indicate that the effects of climate change and rapid societal development will result in increased loadings of terrestrial and anthropogenic DOM into lakes and drive higher rates of within‐lake processing of DOM. Consequently, lakes will play a more important role as an “active pipe” in mediating the flux and transformation of organic carbon, intensifying the coupling between terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles on a continental scale.</jats:p>

TI  - The fitness of the environments of air and water for photosynthesis, growth, reproduction and dispersal of photoautotrophs: An evolutionary and biogeochemical perspective
PY  - 2014
AB  - Life has evolved to exploit aquatic and terrestrial environments, but these present very different challenges and opportunities for photoautotrophs. This paper outlines how the physical and chemical ‘fitness’ of air and water have interacted with the evolution of the physical structures and physiological properties of aquatic and terrestrial algae and plants and altered the biogeochemistry of the planet. The two environments are particularly different for photosynthesis and the consequences of water stress in air and potential carbon and light stress under water are discussed, as are the consequences of the lower density of air compared to water for investment in support. The properties of air and water also affect mineral nutrition, reproduction and dispersal of photoautotrophs and the nature of competition between different types of plants. Furthermore, the pivotal role of photoautotrophs in global biogeochemical cycles and major feedbacks are emphasised. They have altered the environment dramatically, changed the availability of essential resources and created niches that can be exploited by new or different species or types of organism. Recent rapid anthropogenic changes, particularly in CO2, are noted and discussed in relation to the security of human requirements.

TI  - Abiotic control of underwater light in a drinking water reservoir: Photon budget analysis and implications for water quality monitoring
PY  - 2015
AB  - In optically complex inland waters, the underwater attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is controlled by a variable combination of absorption and scattering components of the lake or river water. Here we applied a photon budget approach to identify the main optical components affecting PAR attenuation in Lake St. Charles, a drinking water reservoir for Quebec City, Canada. This analysis showed the dominant role of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption (average of 44% of total absorption during the sampling period), but with large changes over depth in the absolute and relative contribution of the individual absorption components (water, nonalgal particulates, phytoplankton and CDOM) to PAR attenuation. This pronounced vertical variation occurred because of the large spectral changes in the light field with depth, and it strongly affected the average in situ diffuse absorption coefficients in the water column. For example, the diffuse absorption coefficient for pure-water in the ambient light field was 10-fold higher than the value previously measured in the blue open ocean and erroneously applied to lakes and coastal waters. Photon absorption budget calculations for a range of limnological conditions confirmed that phytoplankton had little direct influence on underwater light, even at chlorophyll a values above those observed during harmful algal blooms in the lake. These results imply that traditional measures of water quality such as Secchi depth and radiometric transparency do not provide a meaningful estimate of the biological state of the water column in CDOM-colored lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - Forest defoliator outbreaks alter nutrient cycling in northern waters.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Insect defoliators alter biogeochemical cycles from land into receiving waters by consuming terrestrial biomass and releasing biolabile frass. Here, we related insect outbreaks to water chemistry across 12 boreal lake catchments over 32-years. We report, on average, 27% lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 112% higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in lake waters when defoliators covered entire catchments and reduced leaf area. DOC reductions reached 32% when deciduous stands dominated. Within-year changes in DOC from insect outbreaks exceeded 86% of between-year trends across a larger dataset of 266 boreal and north temperate lakes from 1990 to 2016. Similarly, within-year increases in DIN from insect outbreaks exceeded local, between-year changes in DIN by 12-times, on average. As insect defoliator outbreaks occur at least every 5 years across a wider 439,661 km2 boreal ecozone of Ontario, we suggest they are an underappreciated driver of biogeochemical cycles in forest catchments of this region. Defoliating insects disrupt nutrient cycling of boreal catchments by redistributing carbon and nitrogen from forests to lakes. The resulting shift in lake biogeochemistry exceeds broader between-year trends observed across the boreal and north temperate region.

TI  - Recent organic pollution and its biosensing methods
PY  - 2010
AB  - Rapid economic growth in Japan resulted in serious organic pollution in the 1960s. In contrast, recent organic pollution is caused primarily by phosphorus-based anthropogenic eutrophication, which also induces heavy metal pollution. In the present review, causes of the recent organic pollution are briefly introduced, and our approaches, based on studies of environmental water biosensing methods as tools for estimating the degrees of the recent organic pollution, eutrophication, and heavy metal pollution, are introduced.

TI  - Productivity of lakes varying in water mass dynamics
PY  - 2011
AB  - The aim of the study was to reveal differences in the productivity of lakes varying distinctively in water mass dynamics, as shown by the examples of Lakes Track, Miodowko and Szeląg Wielki situated in the Olsztynskie Lake District. The selected lakes are also characteristic for a high content of nutrients. The analysis of the obtained results has revealed that in the peak of the summer stagnation the productivity was the highest in the polymictic Lake Track. The content of chlorophyll a, which is a measure of primary production, in the Track waters reached the value of 123 mg m -3 whereas the water transparency measured as the visibility of a Secchi disc was below 0.6 m. The lowest primary production in the summer was observed in the bradymictic Lake Miodowko. The transparency of water in this lake was nearly 3 m while the content of chlorophyll a merely 1.7 mg m -3 . Lake Szeląg Wielki, featuring the characteristics of a eumictic reservoir, in the peak of the summer period was noted for the average values of the analysed parameters (1.2 m water transparency, 40.3 mg m -3 chlorophyll a).

TI  - A shady phytoplankton paradox: when phytoplankton increases under low light
PY  - 2018
AB  - Light is a fundamental driver of ecosystem dynamics, affecting the rate of photosynthesis and primary production. In spite of its importance, less is known about its community-scale effects on aquatic ecosystems compared with those of nutrient loading. Understanding light limitation is also important for ecosystem management, as human activities have been rapidly altering light availability to aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that decreasing light can paradoxically increase phytoplankton abundance in shallow lakes. Our results, based on field manipulation experiments, field observations and models, suggest that, under competition for light and nutrients between phytoplankton and submersed macrophytes, alternative stable states are possible under high-light supply. In a macrophyte-dominated state, as light decreases phytoplankton density increases, because macrophytes (which effectively compete for nutrients released from the sediment) are more severely affected by light reduction. Our results demonstrate how species interactions with spatial heterogeneity can cause an unexpected outcome in complex ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that partial surface shading for controlling harmful algal bloom may, counterintuitively, increase phytoplankton abundance by decreasing macrophytes. Therefore, to predict how shallow lake ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations, it is essential to consider effects of light on the interactions between pelagic and benthic producers.

TI  - Alluvial ground water influences dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry of pools within intermittent dryland streams
PY  - 2015
AB  - SUMMARY 1. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry of intermittent rivers is affected by periods of disconnection and drying after cessation of surface flow, with a pronounced concentration of solutes as pools evaporate and contract. However, inputs of alluvial ground water to stream pools may offset the effects of evaporation and influence the quantity and composition of DOM. 2. We used d 18 O and d 2 H values of surface water and alluvial ground water (AW) together with DOM fluorescence excitation–emission spectroscopy to investigate changes in DOM biogeochemistry of pools from four intermittent streams in semi-arid north-west Australia. Our objective was to determine whether the fluorescence characteristics of DOM in pools are driven by their connectivity to alluvial ground water. 3. Pool water d 18 O values ranged from 8 to 13.1 & and showed progressive enrichment as pools became disconnected from AW and subsequently evaporated. Parallel factor analysis of DOM fluorescence revealed that DOM in pools was generally dominated by humic-like components, with lesser contributions from tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like components. 4. DOC concentrations were higher in more evaporated pools. Humic-like and tryptophan-like DOM were also highest in pools isolated from AW, suggesting that inputs of AW had a dilution effect while also moderating evaporative concentration of solutes. In contrast, tyrosine-like DOM was only weakly correlated with the hydrological status of pools. 5. The proportion that each component contributed to total DOM fluorescence remained mostly consistent across both AW-connected and evaporating pools. However, some pools with AW throughflow had higher contributions from tyrosine-like fluorescence and lower contributions from humiclike fluorescence. 6. Disconnection from AW and subsequent evaporative concentration of solutes is an important control on DOM fluorescence characteristics in these intermittent streams. However, production and removal of DOM were only rarely influenced by AW connectivity, likely reflecting the high hydrological variability of intermittent rivers, even following cessation of surface flow.

TI  - Lake browning may fuel phytoplankton biomass and trigger shifts in phytoplankton communities in temperate lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Lake browning—the increase in catchment-derived (allochthonous) dissolved organic matter (DOM) to lakes—is altering lake physicochemical environments, with consequences for phytoplankton biomass and community composition. We hypothesized that as lakes brown, there will be an increase in phytoplankton biomass and a shift to cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton communities as a result of the reduced light availability and increased DOM-bound nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, iron). We tested this hypothesis by sampling temperate lakes in central Ontario (Canada) spanning DOM quantity and quality gradients. We found that lake browning results in larger concentrations of more refractory (i.e., aromatic, high molecular weight) DOM and greater concentrations of nutrients; however, internal nutrient loading was also an important nutrient source in these lakes. We also found that these changes were related to the predominant species in the phytoplankton community. Diatoms dominated in clear oligotrophic lakes. Low levels of lake browning, with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) between 4 and 8 mg L− 1, resulted in a shift from diatoms to cyanobacteria. Higher levels of lake browning, with concentrations of DOC between 8 and 12 mg L− 1, resulted in a replacement of cyanobacteria with mixotrophic species. Lake browning appears to fuel phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations while triggering shifts to phytoplankton able to survive if not thrive in progressively browner waters. Lake browning may therefore have consequences on energy transfer through the lower food web.

TI  - Lake size and fish diversity determine resource use and trophic position of a top predator in high-latitude lakes.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Prey preference of top predators and energy flow across habitat boundaries are of fundamental importance for structure and function of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as they may have strong effects on production, species diversity, and food-web stability. In lakes, littoral and pelagic food-web compartments are typically coupled and controlled by generalist fish top predators. However, the extent and determinants of such coupling remains a topical area of ecological research and is largely unknown in oligotrophic high-latitude lakes. We analyzed food-web structure and resource use by a generalist top predator, the Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.), in 17 oligotrophic subarctic lakes covering a marked gradient in size (0.5–1084 km2) and fish species richness (2–13 species). We expected top predators to shift from littoral to pelagic energy sources with increasing lake size, as the availability of pelagic prey resources and the competition for littoral prey are both likely to be higher in large lakes with multispecies fish communities. We also expected top predators to occupy a higher trophic position in lakes with greater fish species richness due to potential substitution of intermediate consumers (prey fish) and increased piscivory by top predators. Based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, the mean reliance of Arctic charr on littoral energy sources showed a significant negative relationship with lake surface area, whereas the mean trophic position of Arctic charr, reflecting the lake food-chain length, increased with fish species richness. These results were supported by stomach contents data demonstrating a shift of Arctic charr from an invertebrate-dominated diet to piscivory on pelagic fish. Our study highlights that, because they determine the main energy source (littoral vs. pelagic) and the trophic position of generalist top predators, ecosystem size and fish diversity are particularly important factors influencing function and structure of food webs in high-latitude lakes.

TI  - Benthic–planktonic coupling, regime shifts, and whole‐lake primary production in shallow lakes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Alternative stable states in shallow lakes are typically characterized by submerged macrophyte (clear-water state) or phytoplankton (turbid state) dominance. However, a clear-water state may occur in eutrophic lakes even when macrophytes are absent. To test whether sediment algae could cause a regime shift in the absence of macrophytes, we developed a model of benthic (periphyton) and planktonic (phytoplankton) primary production using parameters derived from a shallow macrophyte-free lake that shifted from a turbid to a clear-water state following fish removal (biomanipulation). The model includes a negative feedback effect of periphyton on phosphorus (P) release from sediments. This in turn induces a positive feedback between phytoplankton production and P release. Scenarios incorporating a gradient of external P loading rates revealed that (1) periphyton and phytoplankton both contributed substantially to whole-lake production over a broad range of external P loading in a clear-water state; (2) during the clear-water state, the loss of benthic production was gradually replaced by phytoplankton production, leaving whole-lake production largely unchanged; (3) the responses of lakes to biomanipulation and increased external P loading were both dependent on lake morphometry; and (4) the capacity of periphyton to buffer the effects of increased external P loading and maintain a clear-water state was highly sensitive to relationships between light availability at the sediment surface and the of P release. Our model suggests a mechanism for the persistence of alternative states in shallow macrophyte-free lakes and demonstrates that regime shifts may trigger profound changes in ecosystem structure and function.

TI  - Decrease of Population Divergence in Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis) in Browning Waters : Role of Fatty Acids and Foraging Efficiency
PY  - 2016
AB  - Due to altered biogeochemical processes related to climate change, highly colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources will lead to a water "brownification" in many freshwater systems of the Northern Hemisphere. This will create deteriorated visual conditions that have been found to affect habitat-specific morphological variations in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a previous study. So far, potential drivers and ultimate causes of these findings have not been identified. We conducted a field study to investigate the connection between morphological divergence and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of perch from six lakes across a gradient of DOC concentration. We expected a decrease in the prevalence of PUFAs, which are important for perch growth and divergence with increasing DOC concentrations, due to the restructuring effects of DOC on aquatic food webs. In general, rate of morphological divergence in perch decreased with increasing DOC concentrations. Proportions of specific PUFAs (22:6n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, and 20:4n-6) identified to primarily contribute to overall differences between perch caught in clear and brown-water lakes tended to be connected to overall decline of morphological divergence. However, no overall significant relationship was found, indicating no severe limitation of essential fatty acids for perch inhabiting brown water lakes. We further broaden our approach by conducting a laboratory experiment on foraging efficiency of perch. Therefore, we induced pelagic and littoral phenotypes by differences in habitat-structure and feeding mode and recorded attack rate in a feeding experiment. Generally, fish were less efficient in foraging on littoral prey (Ephemeroptera) when visual conditions were degraded by brown water color. We concluded that browning water may have a strong effect on the forager's ability to find particular food resources, resulting in the reduced development of evolutionary traits, such as habitat- specific morphological divergence.

TI  - Integration of palaeo-and-modern food webs reveal slow changes in a river floodplain wetland ecosystem
PY  - 2020
AB  - Large rivers, including the Murray River system in southeast Australia, are disturbed by many activities. The arrival of European settlers to Australia by the mid-1800s transformed many floodplain wetlands of the lower Murray River system. River impoundment and flow regulation in the late 1800s and, from the 1930s, resulted in species invasion, and elevated nutrient concentrations causing widespread eutrophication. An integrated palaeoecology, and palaeo-and-modern food web approach, incorporating mixing models, was undertaken to reveal changes in a regulated wetland (i.e. Kings Billabong). The lack of preserved sediment suggests the wetland was naturally intermittent before 1890. After this time, when used as a water retention basin, the wetland experienced net sediment accumulation. Subfossil cladocerans, and δ13C of Daphnia, chironomid, and bulk sediment, all reflected an early productive, likely clear water state and shifts in trophic state following river regulation in the 1930s. Food web mixing models, based on δ13C and δ15N in subfossil and modern Daphnia, fish, and submerged and emergent macrophytes, also indicated a shift in the trophic relationships between fish and Daphnia. By the 1970s, a new state was established but a further significant alteration of nitrogen and carbon sources, and trophic interactions, continued through to the early 2000s. A possible switch from Daphnia as a prey of Australian Smelt could have modified the food web of the wetland by c. 2006. The timing of this change corresponded to the expansion of emergent macrophytes possibly due to landscape level disruptions. The evidence of these changes suggests a need for a broader understanding of the evolution of wetlands for the management of floodplains in the region.

TI  - Radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity fuel underwater darkening in lakes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Long-term decreases in the incident total radiation and water clarity might substantially affect the underwater light environment in aquatic ecosystems. However, the underlying mechanism and relative contributions of radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity to the underwater light environment on a national or global scale remains largely unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset of unprecedented scale in China’s lakes to address the combined effects of radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity on underwater darkening. Long-term total radiation and sunshine duration showed 5.8% and 7.9% decreases, respectively, after 2000 compared to 1961–1970, resulting in net radiation dimming. An in situ Secchi disk depth (SDD) dataset in 170 lakes showed that the mean SDD significantly decreased from 1.80 ± 2.19 m before 1995 to 1.28 ± 1.82 m after 2005. SDD remote sensing estimations for 641 lakes with areas ≥ 10 km2 showed that SDD markedly decreased from 1.26 ± 0.62 m during 1985–1990 to 1.14 ± 0.66 m during 2005–2010. Radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity jointly caused an approximately 10% decrease in the average available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the euphotic layer. Our results revealed a more important role of decreasing water clarity in underwater darkening than radiation dimming. A meta-analysis of long-term SDD observation data from 61 various waters further elucidated a global extensive underwater darkening. Underwater darkening implies a decrease in water quality for potable water supplies, recession in macrophytes and benthic algae, and decreases in benthic primary production, fishery production, and biodiversity.

TI  - Zooplanktivore fish body growth responses to browning‐induced light limitation vary over ontogeny, but not with fish density
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ongoing climate change is leading to browning of many lakes and coastal areas, which can impair fish body growth and biomass production. However, whether and how effects of light limitation caused by browning on fish body growth vary over early ontogeny is unknown. In this study, we set up a mesocosm experiment to test whether roach (<jats:italic>Rutilus rutilus</jats:italic>) body growth responses to browning depend on body size, and if findings are robust over roach densities. We also studied a potential mechanism for size‐specific responses by conducting an aquaria experiment to test if size‐specific prey selectivity in roach changes with browning. We found that roach body growth responses to browning‐induced light limitation vary over ontogeny (independent of roach density), negatively affecting body growth of young‐of‐the‐year (YOY) but not of 1‐year‐old individuals. We also show that this difference in growth response is likely a consequence of browning‐induced alterations in zooplankton community composition and variation in prey selectivity between YOY and 1‐year‐old fish. This suggests that we should account for the diverse effects of browning over fish ontogeny, mediated via altered prey composition and ontogenetic changes in prey preference, when assessing overall impacts of browning on aquatic ecosystems.</jats:p>

TI  - Carbon dynamics and changing winter conditions: a review of current understanding and future research directions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract. Despite the important role of winters for northern ecosystems, it remains the least understood of all the seasons. Here, we summarize existing empirical studies on winter climate and carbon dynamics and highlight some important future research directions. The existing studies include field-scale snow-cover manipulation experiments representing extreme soil climate conditions, laboratory soil incubations studying the influential factors, and time-series of climate and carbon data showing long-term natural variations and existing trends. Most of the field and laboratory experiments indicate an increased soil organic carbon loss due to soil frost. Long-term data demonstrate temporal changes in winter CO2 efflux and its important contribution to the annual fluxes. A number of research priorities to improve our understanding of winter conditions include (i) ecosystem processes in the fall-winter and winter-spring shoulder seasons, (ii) extreme events, (iii) partitioning into organic- and inorganic carbon, (iv) carry-over effects of winter and growing season on each other, (v) long-term cumulative impacts, and (vi) improved winter process modelling. These areas of research would enable an improved understanding of the role of the snow covered period for carbon cycling, and provide a basis for more realistic models that include winter processes.

TI  - Catchment-scale carbon exports across a subarctic landscape gradient
PY  - 2013
AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Climatic change is currently enhancing permafrost thawing and hydrological cycling in subarctic and arctic catchments with major consequences for the carbon export to aquatic ecosystems. We studied stream water carbon export in several tundra dominated catchments in northern Sweden. There were clear seasonal differences in both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. The highest DOC concentrations occurred during the spring freshet while the highest DIC concentrations were always observed during winter baseflow conditions for the six catchments considered in this study. In these subarctic catchments, DIC accounted for at least about half of the annual mass of C exported. Further, there was a direct relationship between both hydrologic flow pathway length and the maximum flow to minimum flow ratio (which serves as a proxy for fractioning between surface and subsurface flow pathways) and annual carbon fluxes for these six catchments. Further, these relationships were more prevalent for annual DIC exports than annual DOC exports in this region. These results highlight that there can be large regional differences in high latitude ecosystems and emphasize the importance of proper representation of subsurface hydrogeological conditions. This is particularly relevant in subarctic environments were thawing permafrost and changes to subsurface ice due to global warming can influence stream water fluxes of C. The large proportion of stream water DIC flux also has implications on regional C budgets and needs to be considered in order to understand climate induced feedback mechanisms across the landscape.</jats:p>

TI  - AFTER THE FALL: HOW CHANGES IN TEMPERATE FORESTS ALTER WETLAND COMMUNITIES
PY  - 2013
AB  - The composition of species is continually shifting due to natural succession, disturbance, and human influences. Predicting effects of these changes requires understanding species interactions, phenotypic traits responsible these interaction, and general relationships between diversity and ecological processes. In this thesis, I explore how changes in temperate forest tree composition alter processes within forest wetland ecosystems, the chemical traits of litter responsible for these effects, and general relationships between litter diversity and ecological processes. Forest wetlands often receive massive amounts of tree leaf litter, and contain diverse food webs that recycle energy and nutrients within litter into myriad inorganic and organic forms. In the first study, I hypothesized that the abiotic and biological components of forest wetlands respond to changes in the input of tree leaf litter species. I provided different litter species to wetland communities in outdoor mesocosms, using ten common deciduous tree litter species. Effects were dramatic, including variation in the biomass, density, and survival of consumers. In this study, I also demonstrate that several traits of litter explain much of the variation in these effects. In the second study, I hypothesized that variation in litter inputs also induce phenotypic changes in consumer development and morphology. Using wood frogs as a model species, I found that variation in litter species alters development rate and several morphological features, such as tail length, mouth size, and gut length. In the third study, I hypothesized that variation in litter inputs alters predator-prey interactions by changing the chemical and physical structure of wetland ecosystems. The results of this study suggest that interactions between litter resources and top-down interactions should be considered to accurately predict the consequences of shifting litter species composition. In the final study, I hypothesized that a general, positive relationship exists between litter chemical trait diversity and wetland consumer biomass. I found strong effects of trait diversity on decomposition rate, but no effects across a diverse array of consumer species. This suggests that wetland communities – although responsive to changes in single litter species chemistry – respond positively to increased litter species richness and may be resistant to fluctuations of litter chemical diversity.

TI  - Old before your time: Ancient carbon incorporation in contemporary aquatic foodwebs
PY  - 2017
AB  - The current paradigm in trophic dynamic theory is that organisms will gain more energy from fresh, “young” organic materials because they contain the essential elements and chemical characteristics for enhancing growth, unlike more aged and thus conceptually degraded resources. However, a growing body of recent literature is raising exceptions to this resource-age paradigm and highlights that organisms present in diverse aquatic settings in fact incorporate old organic carbon into their biomass. This shift in resource utilization has the potential to alter foodweb stability, structure, and dynamics, but has yet to be integrated into ecological studies and conceptual frameworks. In this review, we first outline a number of recent studies providing direct evidence of the transport and incorporation of old organic carbon in aquatic food webs, and then discuss the ecological implications of this changing view in resource utilization. We ultimately highlight future research avenues that will provide new insights into the response of aquatic foodwebs to the increased mobilization and delivery of old organic carbon to aquatic settings following anthropogenic perturbations and ongoing climatic change.

TI  - Prediction of Algal Chlorophyll-a and Water Clarity in Monsoon-Region Reservoir Using Machine Learning Approaches
PY  - 2019
AB  - The prediction of algal chlorophyll-a and water clarity in lentic ecosystems is a hot issue due to rapid deteriorations of drinking water quality and eutrophication processes. Our key objectives of the study were to predict long-term algal chlorophyll-a and transparency (water clarity), measured as Secchi depth, in spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic reservoirs largely influenced by the Asian monsoon during 2000–2017 and then determine the reservoir trophic state using a multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). We tested the models to analyze the spatial patterns of the riverine zone (Rz), transitional zone (Tz) and lacustrine zone (Lz) and temporal variations of premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon. Monthly physicochemical parameters and precipitation data (2000–2017) were used to build up the models of MLR, SVM and ANN and then were confirmed by cross-validation processes. The model of SVM showed better predictive performance than the models of MLR and ANN, in both before validation and after validation. Values of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were lower in the SVM model, compared to the models of MLR and ANN, indicating that the SVM model has better performance than the MLR and ANN models. The coefficient of determination was higher in the SVM model, compared to the MLR and ANN models. The mean and maximum total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)), water temperature (WT), conductivity and algal chlorophyll (CHL-a) were in higher concentrations in the riverine zone compared to transitional and lacustrine zone due to surface run-off from the watershed. During the premonsoon and postmonsoon, the average annual rainfall was 59.50 mm and 54.73 mm whereas it was 236.66 mm during the monsoon period. From 2013 to 2017, the trophic state of the reservoir on the basis of CHL-a and SD was from mesotrophic to oligotrophic. Analysis of the importance of input variables indicated that WT, TP, TSS, TN, NP ratios and the rainfall influenced the chlorophyll-a and transparency directly in the reservoir. These findings of the algal chlorophyll-a predictions and Secchi depth may provide key clues for better management strategy in the reservoir.

TI  - Partial coupling and differential regulation of biologically and photo-chemically labile dissolved organic carbon across boreal aquatic networks
PY  - 2014
AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Despite the rapidly increasing volume of research on the biological and photochemical degradation of DOC in aquatic environments, little is known on the large-scale patterns in biologically and photo-chemically degradable DOC (Bd-DOC and Pd-DOC, respectively) in continental watersheds, and on the links that exist between these two key properties that greatly influence the flow of carbon from continents to oceans. Here we explore the patterns of Bd- and Pd-DOC across hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands spanning a large range of system trophy and terrestrial influence, and compared the drivers of these two reactive pools of DOC at the landscape level. Using standardized incubations of natural waters, we found that the concentrations of Bd- and Pd-DOC co-varied across all systems studied but were nevertheless related to different pools of dissolved organic matter (DOM, identified by fluorescence analyses) in ambient waters. A combination of nutrients and protein-like DOM explained nearly half of the variation in Bd-DOC, whereas Pd-DOC was exclusively predicted by DOM optical properties, consistent with the photochemical degradability of specific fluorescent DOM (FDOM) pools that we experimentally determined. The concentrations of colored DOM (CDOM), a proxy of terrestrial influence, almost entirely accounted for the observed relationship between FDOM and the concentrations of both Bd- and Pd-DOC. The concentrations of CDOM and of the putative bio-labile fluorescence component shifted from complete decoupling in clear-water environments to strong coupling in browner streams and wetlands. This suggests a baseline autochthonous Bd-DOC pool fuelled by internal production that is gradually overwhelmed by land-derived Bd-DOC as terrestrial influence increases across landscape gradients. The importance of land as a major source of both biologically and photo-chemically degradable DOC for continental watersheds resulted in a partial coupling of those carbon pools in natural freshwaters, despite fundamental contrasts in terms of their composition and regulation. </jats:p>

TI  - Metabolic and physiochemical responses to a whole-lake experimental increase in dissolved organic carbon in a north-temperate lake
PY  - 2015
AB  - Over the last several decades, many lakes globally have increased in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), calling into question how lake functions may respond to increasing DOC. Unfortunately, our basis for making predictions is limited to spatial surveys, modeling, and laboratory experiments, which may not accurately capture important whole-ecosystem processes. In this article, we present data on metabolic and physiochemical responses of a multiyear experimental whole-lake increase in DOC concentration. Unexpectedly, we observed an increase in pelagic gross primary production, likely due to a small increase in phosphorus as well as a surprising lack of change in epilimnetic light climate. We also speculate on the importance of lake size modifying the relationship between light climate and elevated DOC. A larger increase in ecosystem respiration resulted in an increased heterotrophy for the treatment basin. The magnitude of the increase in heterotrophy was extremely close to the excess DOC load to the treatment basin, indicating that changes in heterotrophy may be predictable if allochthonous carbon loads are well-constrained. Elevated DOC concentration also reduced thermocline and mixed layer depth and reduced whole-lake temperature. Results from this experiment were quantitatively different, and sometimes even in the opposite direction, from expectations based on cross-system surveys and bottle experiments, emphasizing the importance of whole-ecosystem experiments in understanding ecosystem response to environmental change.

TI  - Piscivore-Prey Fish Interactions: Mechanisms behind Diurnal Patterns in Prey Selectivity in Brown and Clear Water.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Environmental change may affect predator-prey interactions in lakes through deterioration of visual conditions affecting foraging success of visually oriented predators. Environmental change in lakes includes an increase in humic matter causing browner water and reduced visibility, affecting the behavioural performance of both piscivores and prey. We studied diurnal patterns of prey selection in piscivorous pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) in both field and laboratory investigations. In the field we estimated prey selectivity and prey availability during day and night in a clear and a brown water lake. Further, prey selectivity during day and night conditions was studied in the laboratory where we manipulated optical conditions (humic matter content) of the water. Here, we also studied the behaviours of piscivores and prey, focusing on foraging-cycle stages such as number of interests and attacks by the pikeperch as well as the escape distance of the prey fish species. Analyses of gut contents from the field study showed that pikeperch selected perch (Perca fluviatilis) over roach (Rutilus rutilus) prey in both lakes during the day, but changed selectivity towards roach in both lakes at night. These results were corroborated in the selectivity experiments along a brown-water gradient in day and night light conditions. However, a change in selectivity from perch to roach was observed when the optical condition was heavily degraded, from either brown-stained water or light intensity. At longer visual ranges, roach initiated escape at distances greater than pikeperch attack distances, whereas perch stayed inactive making pikeperch approach and attack at the closest range possible. Roach anti-predatory behaviour decreased in deteriorated visual conditions, altering selectivity patterns. Our results highlight the importance of investigating both predator and prey responses to visibility conditions in order to understand the effects of degrading optical conditions on piscivore-prey interaction strength and thereby ecosystem responses to brownification of waters.

TI  - Determinants of bacterioplankton structures in the typically turbid Weihe River and its clear tributaries from the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The Weihe River is the largest tributary of the typically sediment-laden Yellow River in China. Assuming that high sediment concentrations may increase the turbidity of water bodies, and therefore affect riverine ecosystem, in which the bacterioplankton are crucial components and serve as important indicators of environmental and ecological status through their structure and response to the environment change, it is essential to deep understanding the bacterioplankton structure and influencing factors in turbid and clear river ecosystems. Here, high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the differences in bacterioplankton structure and major determinants in the typically turbid Weihe River and its clear tributaries from the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains from October to November 2017 and April to May 2018. The results demonstrated that bacterioplankton communities shared similar dominant subcommunities in the Weihe River mainstem and its tributaries, mainly consisting of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla and Flavobacterium and Acinetobacter genera. The Faith phylogenetic diversity (PD) index was significantly higher in the turbid mainstem than in the tributaries and was related to turbidity (Turb). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that geographical distance exhibited notable influences on the community composition in the mainstem; however, the communities in the tributaries had a much stronger response to local environmental factors. Bacteria exhibited a significant distance-decay relationship in the mainstem, whereas geographical distance was not correlated with community dissimilarities in the tributaries. Chlorophyll a emerged as the major determinant of the bacterioplankton structure in the turbid Weihe River, indicating the importance of phytoplankton-bacterioplankton relationships in the turbid river system. These results provide important insights into future research on microbial ecology, environmental monitoring and classified management in diverse river systems.

TI  - Intraspecific phenotypic differences in fish affect ecosystem processes as much as bottom–up factors
PY  - 2015
AB  - Evolution of life history traits can occur rapidly and has the potential to infl uence ecological processes, which can also be shaped by abiotic and biotic factors. Few studies have shown that life history phenotype can aff ect ecological processes as much as commonly studied biotic ecological variables, but currently we do not know how the ecological eff ects of life history phenotype compare in size to the eff ects of abiotic factors, or whether the ecological eff ects of phenotypes are sensitive to variability in abiotic conditions. Using a factorial mesocosm experiment we compared the ecosystem eff ects of guppy Poecilia reticulata life history phenotypes in two light treatments representing a four-fold diff erence in light levels, which was comparable to upstream–downstream diff erences in light availability in Trinidadian streams. Light and phenotype had signifi cant eff ects on similar aspects of ecosystem function. Whereas light had a stronger eff ect on ecosystem structure (algal and invertebrate stocks) than phenotype, phenotype and light had nearly equal eff ects on many ecosystem processes (nutrient recycling, nutrient fl uxes, ecosystem metabolism and leaf litter decomposition). Light had a stronger eff ect on most guppy life history traits and guppy fi tness than diff erences between phenotypes. Th e eff ect of light on these traits was consistent with higher availability of food resources in the high light treatments. Interactions between light and phenotype were weak for the majority of response variables suggesting that abiotic variability did not alter the mechanisms by which phenotypes aff ect ecosystem function. We conclude that subtle phenotypic diff erences in consumers can aff ect ecosystem processes as much as meaningful variability in abiotic factors which until recently were thought to be the primary drivers of ecosystem function in nature. However, despite its eff ects on traits and the ecosystem, light did not alter the eff ect of guppy phenotype on ecosystem function.

TI  - Demographic consequences of mitigating strategies in planktonic invertebrates facing global browning of freshwater ecosystem
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recently, it has been reported that freshwater browning has less effect on planktonic invertebrate abundances than would be expected from current knowledge regarding of the biochemical activity of dissolved organic matter. It may be that the weak responses of whole communities to browning are masked because the individual mitigating strategies of community components have disparate demographic consequences. To examine the above hypothesis, individual-, population- and community-level responses of freshwater invertebrates to varying concentrations of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) were investigated. Common cladocerans of the Chydoridae family, Chydorus sphaericus and Acroperus harpae, were used in the experiment which revealed that species employed different strategies to cope with tDOM. C. sphaericus maintained high production of asexual offspring at the cost of individual body growth, so any decreases in the population sizes were not observed. A. harpae, conversely, invested mainly in the production of resting eggs and increased survivability, which resulted in smaller populations. Invertebrate communities showed similar resilience and temporal stability across tDOM concentrations. Therefore, the influence of tDOM was apparently negligible at community level, since the effects of the mitigating strategies of the two species complemented one another. This experiment showed that symptoms of freshwater browning might be difficult to observe at population and community level due to effective mitigating strategies performed at the level of individuals. The effects of browning on freshwater invertebrates might be better considered in the context of alterations in the demographic rates together constituting life-cycle strategies to maintain species survival.

TI  - Simulated eutrophication and browning alters zooplankton nutritional quality and determines juvenile fish growth and survival.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The first few months of life is the most vulnerable period for fish and their optimal hatching time with zooplankton prey is favored by natural selection. Traditionally, however, prey abundance (i.e., zooplankton density) has been considered important, whereas prey nutritional composition has been largely neglected in natural settings. High-quality zooplankton, rich in both essential amino acids (EAAs) and fatty acids (FAs), are required as starting prey to initiate development and fast juvenile growth. Prey quality is dependent on environmental conditions, and, for example, eutrophication and browning are two major factors defining primary producer community structures that will directly determine the nutritional quality of the basal food sources (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter) for zooplankton. We experimentally tested how eutrophication and browning affect the growth and survival of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by changing the quality of basal resources. We fed the fish on herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia) grown with foods of different nutritional quality (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter), and used GC-MS, stable isotope labeling as well as bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses for detecting the effects of different diets on the nutritional status of fish. The content of EAAs and omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in basal foods and zooplankton decreased in both eutrophication and browning treatments. The decrease in ω-3 PUFA and especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reflected to fish juveniles, but they were able to compensate for low availability of EAAs in their food. Therefore, the reduced growth and survival of the juvenile fish was linked to the low availability of DHA. Fish showed very low ability to convert alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to DHA. We conclude that eutrophication and browning decrease the availability of the originally phytoplankton-derived DHA for zooplankton and juvenile fish, suggesting bottom-up regulation of food web quality.

TI  - Allochthonous carbon is a major regulator to bacterial growth and community composition in subarctic freshwaters
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the subarctic region, climate warming and permafrost thaw are leading to emergence of ponds and to an increase in mobility of catchment carbon. As carbon of terrestrial origin is increasing in subarctic freshwaters the resource pool supporting their microbial communities and metabolism is changing, with consequences to overall aquatic productivity. By sampling different subarctic water bodies for a one complete year we show how terrestrial and algal carbon compounds vary in a range of freshwaters and how differential organic carbon quality is linked to bacterial metabolism and community composition. We show that terrestrial drainage and associated nutrients supported higher bacterial growth in ponds and river mouths that were influenced by fresh terrestrial carbon than in large lakes with carbon from algal production. Bacterial diversity, however, was lower at sites influenced by terrestrial carbon inputs. Bacterial community composition was highly variable among different water bodies and especially influenced by concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fulvic acids, proteins and nutrients. Furthermore, a distinct preference was found for terrestrial vs. algal carbon among certain bacterial tribes. The results highlight the contribution of the numerous ponds to cycling of terrestrial carbon in the changing subarctic and arctic regions.

TI  - Anthropocene climate warming enhances autochthonous carbon cycling in an upland Arctic lake, Disko Island, West Greenland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract. The Arctic is rapidly changing, disrupting biogeochemical cycles and the processing, delivery and sedimentation of carbon (C), in linked terrestrial–aquatic systems. In this investigation, we coupled a hydrogeomorphic assessment of catchment soils, sediments and plants with a recent lake sediment sequence to understand the source and quality of organic carbon present in three Arctic upland lake catchments on Disko Island, located just south of the low–high Arctic transition zone. This varied permafrost landscape has exposed soils with less vegetation cover at higher altitudes, and lakes received varying amounts of glacial meltwater inputs. We provide improved isotope and biomarker source identifications for palaeolimnological studies in high-latitude regions, where terrestrial vegetation is at or close to its northerly and altitudinal range limit. The poorly developed catchment soils lead to lake waters with low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ( ≤1.5 mg L−1 ). Sedimentary carbon / nitrogen (C / N) ratios, the C isotope composition of organic matter ( δ13Corg ) and biomarker ratios ( n -alkanes, n -alkanols, n -alkanoic acids and sterols) showed that sedimentary organic matter (OM) in these lakes is mostly derived from aquatic sources (algae and macrophytes). We used a 210Pb -dated sediment core to determine how carbon cycling in a lake–catchment system (Disko 2) had changed over recent centuries. Recent warming since the end of the Little Ice Age ( LIA∼1860 CE ), which accelerated after ca. 1950, led to melt of glacier ice and permafrost, releasing nutrients and DOC to the lake and stimulating pronounced aquatic algal production, as shown by a >10 -fold increase in β -carotene, indicative of a major regime shift. We also demonstrate that recent increases in catchment terrestrial vegetation cover contributed to the autochthonous response. Our findings highlight that in Arctic lakes with sparsely developed catchment vegetation and soils, recent Anthropocene warming results in pronounced changes to in-lake C processing and the deposition of more reactive, predominately autochthonous C, when compared with extensively vegetated low-Arctic systems.

TI  - Large-Scale Retrieval of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter in Northern Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Data
PY  - 2020
AB  - Owing to the significant societal value of inland water resources, there is a need for cost-effective monitoring of water quality on large scales. We tested the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2A to monitor a key water quality parameter, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), in various types of lakes in northern Sweden. Values of a(420)CDOM (CDOM absorption at 420 nm wavelength) were obtained by analyzing water samples from 46 lakes in five districts across Sweden within an area of approximately 800 km2. We evaluated the relationships between a(420)CDOM and band ratios derived from Sentinel-2A Level-1C and Level-2A products. The band ratios B2/B3 (460 nm/560 nm) and B3/B5 (560 nm/705 nm) showed poor relationships with a(420)CDOM in Level-1C and 2A data both before and after the removal of outliers. However, there was a slightly stronger power relationship between the atmospherically-corrected B3/B4 ratio and a(420)CDOM (R2 = 0.28, n = 46), and this relationship was further improved (R2 = 0.65, n = 41) by removing observations affected by light haze and cirrus clouds. This study covered a wide range of lakes in different landscape settings and demonstrates the broad applicability of a(420)CDOM retrieval algorithms based on the B3/B4 ratio derived from Sentinel-2A.

TI  - Growth rate and abundance of common fishes is negatively related to dissolved organic carbon concentration in lakes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can limit food web productivity in lakes, potentially imposing resource limitation on fishes. We asked whether the abundance or early growth rate of three fish species was negatively related to DOC in 59 lakes in southern Quebec, Canada, where DOC concentrations ranged from 4 to 16 mg·L−1 for lakes containing walleye (Sander vitreum) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and from 2.6 to 9 mg·L−1 for lakes containing lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Estimates of abundance and growth rate were more precise for walleye and lake trout than for yellow perch because of differences in sample size. Abundance was negatively related to DOC for walleye and perhaps also for lake trout and yellow perch. Early growth rate was negatively related to DOC for walleye and lake trout, but not for yellow perch. These results support a growing body of literature suggesting that the productivity of fish populations may be negatively related to DOC concentrations in lakes.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Frozen tundra soils hold one of the Earth's largest pools of organic carbon. Climate warming and the associated permafrost thaw release a large fraction of this carbon into circumpolar lakes, inducing extreme browning that fuels the heterotrophic microbial food web. How this permafrost carbon affects organisms higher in the food chain remains unknown. Using dissolved organic matter properties, total phosphorus, chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>, fatty acids, and stable isotopes, we investigated the influence of thawing permafrost on primary producers and primary consumers of the planktonic food web. We sampled four subarctic thaw ponds that were affected by permafrost carbon and another four ponds that were not. Our results highlight the stimulating influence of eroding and degrading ice‐rich permafrost on nutrients and planktonic algae. Relative to the non‐thaw ponds, the permafrost thaw‐influenced freshwaters had higher total phosphorus concentrations (14.8 vs. 70.4 µg/L, respectively). This in turn led to a higher chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (2.7 vs. 45.2 µg/L) and seston omega‐3 fatty acid concentrations (7.3 vs. 53.5 µg/L) despite significantly reduced light for primary production. Differences between the thaw and non‐thaw ponds were less marked at the primary consumer level. <jats:italic>Daphnia pulex</jats:italic>, which dominated the crustacean zooplankton community, did not respond to the higher omega‐3 availability in the thaw ponds but rather assimilated the high‐quality fatty acids equally in all ponds, possibly because their metabolic needs were already saturated. However, some lower quality terrestrial carbon compounds from permafrost ended up in the <jats:italic>D. pulex</jats:italic> body mass, resulting in a median allochthony of 18% based on fatty acid mixing model; non‐thaw ponds had median allochthony mixing model estimates of 8%. The high availability of algal resources seemed to prevent extensive zooplankton allochthony in subarctic thaw ponds.</jats:p>

TI  - Magnitude and regulation of bacterioplankton respiratory quotient across freshwater environmental gradients
PY  - 2011
AB  - Bacterioplankton respiration (BR) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwaters. Complete understanding of BR is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient (RQ; mole of CO2 produced per mole of O2 consumed) to calculate rates of BR. Many studies have, without clear support, assumed a fixed RQ around 1. Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in Quebec (Canada), using O2 and CO2 optic sensors. The RQs tended to converge around 1.2, but showed large variability (s.d.=0.45) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level, substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics. Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds. RQs were on average low in net autotrophic systems, where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates, whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates, for example, organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes, led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems. Further, we suggest that BR contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO2 emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ∼1. Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of BR determination, but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Direct and Indirect Effects of Dissolved Organic Matter Source and Concentration on Denitrification in Northern Florida Rivers
PY  - 2013
AB  - Using a natural gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) source and concentration in rivers of northern Florida, we investigated how terrestrially-derived DOC affects denitrification rates in river sediments. Specifically, we examined if the higher concentrations of DOC in blackwater rivers stimulate denitrification, or whether such terrestrially-derived DOC supports lower denitrification rates because (1) it is less labile than DOC from aquatic primary production; whether (2) terrestrial DOC directly inhibits denitrification via biochemical mechanisms; and/or whether (3) terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via reduced light availability to—and thus DOC exudation by—aquatic primary producers. We differentiated among these mechanisms using laboratory denitrification assays that subjected river sediments to factorial amendments of NO3− and dextrose, humic acid dosing, and cross-incubations of sediments and water from different river sources. DOC from terrestrial sources neither depressed nor stimulated denitrification rates, indicating low lability of this DOC but no direct inhibition; humic acid additions similarly did not affect denitrification rates. However, responses to addition of labile C increased with long-term average DOC concentration, which supports the hypothesis that terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via decreased autochthonous production. Observed and future changes in DOC concentration may therefore reduce the ability of inland waterways to remove reactive nitrogen.

TI  - The Role of Methane Transport From the Active Layer in Sustaining Methane Emissions and Food Chains in Subarctic Ponds
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Groundwater discharge from the seasonally thawed active layer is increasingly recognized as an important pathway for delivering methane (CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) into Arctic lakes and streams, but its contribution to CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from thaw ponds and its influence on the trophic support and nutritional quality of pond food chains remains unexplored. We quantified the transport of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> from the active layer through groundwater discharge into thaw ponds in a subarctic catchment in northern Sweden, using radon (<jats:sup>222</jats:sup>Rn) as groundwater tracer. We analyzed stable isotopes and fatty acids of pond macroinvertebrates to evaluate the potential effects of groundwater‐mediated CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> inputs on the aquatic food chains. Our results indicate that active layer groundwater discharge flows are nontrivial (range 6%–46% of pond volume per day) and the associated CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> fluxes (median 339 mg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, interquartile range [IQR]: 179–419 mg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) can sustain the diffusive CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from most of the ponds (155 mg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, IQR: 55–234 mg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Consumers in ponds receiving greater CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> inputs from the active layer had lower stable carbon (C) isotope signatures that indicates a greater trophic reliance on methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), and they had lower nutritional quality as indicated by their lower tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Overall, this work links physical (CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> transport from the active layer), biogeochemical (CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission), and ecological (MOB‐consumer interaction) processes to provide direct evidence for the role of active layer groundwater discharge in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> cycling of subarctic thaw ponds.</jats:p>

TI  - Sources, factors, mechanisms and possible solutions to pollutants in marine ecosystems
PY  - 2013
AB  - Algal toxins or red-tide toxins produced during algal blooms are naturally-derived toxic emerging contaminants (ECs) that may kill organisms, including humans, through contaminated fish or seafood. Other ECs produced either naturally or anthropogenically ultimately flow into marine waters. Pharmaceuticals are also an important pollution source, mostly due to overproduction and incorrect disposal. Ship breaking and recycle industries (SBRIs) can also release various pollutants and substantially deteriorate habitats and marine biodiversity. Overfishing is significantly increasing due to the global food crisis, caused by an increasing world population. Organic matter (OM) pollution and global warming (GW) are key factors that exacerbate these challenges (e.g. algal blooms), to which acidification in marine waters should be added as well. Sources, factors, mechanisms and possible remedial measures of these challenges to marine ecosystems are discussed, including their eventual impact on all forms of life including humans.

TI  - Species richness and functional structure of fish assemblages in three freshwater habitats: effects of environmental factors and management.
PY  - 2019
AB  - In this study, the inverted trophic hypothesis was tested in the freshwater fish communities of a reservoir. The distribution of fish species in three freshwater habitats in the Jurumirim Reservoir, Brazil, was examined using both species richness and the relative proportions of different trophic groups. These groups were used as a proxy for functional structure in an attempt to test the ability of these measures to assess fish diversity. Assemblage structures were first described using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The influence of environmental conditions for multiple fish assemblage response variables (richness, total abundance and abundance per trophic group) was tested using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). The metric typically employed to describe diversity; that is, species richness, was not related to environmental conditions. However, absolute species abundance was relatively well explained with up to 54% of the variation in the observed data accounted for. Differences in the dominance of trophic groups were most apparent in response to the presence of introduced fish species: the iliophagous and piscivorous trophic groups were positively associated, while detritivores and herbivores were negatively associated, with the alien species. This suggests that monitoring functional diversity might be more valuable than species diversity for assessing effects of disturbances and managements policies on the fish community.

TI  - Shallow freshwater ecosystems of the circumpolar Arctic.
PY  - 2011
AB  - This review provides a synthesis of limnological data and conclusions from studies on ponds and small lakes at our research sites in Subarctic and Arctic Canada, Alaska, northern Scandinavia, and Greenland. Many of these water bodies contain large standing stocks of benthic microbial mats that grow in relatively nutrient-rich conditions, while the overlying water column is nutrient-poor and supports only low concentrations of phytoplankton. Zooplankton biomass can, however, be substantial and is supported by grazing on the microbial mats as well as detrital inputs, algae, and other plankton. In addition to large annual temperature fluctuations, a short growing season, and freeze-up and desiccation stress in winter, these ecosystems are strongly regulated by the supply of organic matter and its optical and biogeochemical properties. Dissolved organic carbon affects bacterial diversity and production, the ratio between pelagic and benthic primary productivity via light attenuation, and the exposure and photoprotection responses of organisms to solar ultraviolet radiation. Climate warming is likely to result in reduced duration of ice-cover, warmer water temperatures, and increased nutrient supplies from the more biogeochemically active catchments, which in turn may cause greater planktonic production. Predicted changes in the amount and origin of dissolved organic matter may favour increased microbial activity in the water column and decreased light availability for the phytobenthos, with effects on biodiversity at all trophic levels, and increased channelling of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases.

TI  - A Hydro-Economic Model for Water Level Fluctuations: Combining Limnology with Economics for Sustainable Development of Hydropower
PY  - 2014
AB  - Water level fluctuations in lakes lead to shoreline displacement. The seasonality of flooding or beaching of the littoral area affects nutrient cycling, redox gradients in sediments, and life cycles of aquatic organisms. Despite the ecological importance of water level fluctuations, we still lack a method that assesses water levels in the context of hydropower operations. Water levels in reservoirs are influenced by the operator of a hydropower plant, who discharges water through the turbines or stores water in the reservoir, in a fashion that maximizes profit. This rationale governs the seasonal operation scheme and hence determines the water levels within the boundaries of the reservoir's water balance. For progress towards a sustainable development of hydropower, the benefits of this form of electricity generation have to be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of the anthropogenic water level fluctuations. We developed a hydro-economic model that combines an economic optimization function with hydrological estimators of the water balance of a reservoir. Applying this model allowed us to accurately predict water level fluctuations in a reservoir. The hydro-economic model also allowed for scenario calculation of how water levels change with climate change scenarios and with a change in operating scheme of the reservoir (increase in turbine capacity). Further model development will enable the consideration of a variety of additional parameters, such as water withdrawal for irrigation, drinking water supply, or altered energy policies. This advances our ability to sustainably manage water resources that must meet both economic and environmental demands.

TI  - Off-site impacts of agricultural composting: role of terrestrially derived organic matter in structuring aquatic microbial communities and their metabolic potential.
PY  - 2014
AB  - While considered as sustainable and low-cost agricultural amendments, the impacts of organic fertilizers on downstream aquatic microbial communities remain poorly documented. We investigated the quantity and quality of the dissolved organic matter leaching from agricultural soil amended with compost, vermicompost or biochar and assessed their effects on lake microbial communities, in terms of viral and bacterial abundances, community structure and metabolic potential. The addition of compost and vermicompost significantly increased the amount of dissolved organic carbon in the leachate compared with soil alone. Leachates from these additions, either with or without biochar, were highly bioavailable to aquatic microbial communities, although reducing the metabolic potential of the community and harbouring more specific communities. Although not affecting bacterial richness or taxonomic distributions, the specific addition of biochar affected the original lake bacterial communities, resulting in a strongly different community. This could be partly explained by viral burst and converging bacterial abundances throughout the samples. These results underline the necessity to include off-site impacts of agricultural amendments when considering their cascading effect on downstream aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Diatom response to mid-Holocene climate in three small Arctic lakes in northernmost Finnmark:
PY  - 2015
AB  - Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from lake sediment biological records can be challenging, due to variation in non-climatic factors, which alter ecosystem responses. To consider this, it is important to replicate a study regionally, so as to gain information on spatial variability of ecosystem response and the influence of site-specific conditions. Previous pollen-based palaeoclimatic records from three well-dated Arctic lake sites highlight the response of regional Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forest-tundra transition to Holocene climatic variability and suggest the northernmost Peninsulas of Finnmark to be climatically sensitive. This study analysed dated sediment sequences between c. 3970 and c. 6200 cal. yr BP from these three previously published shallow lakes: Liten Cap’pesjav’ri (LCJ), over Gunnarsfjorden (OGF) and over Kobbkrokvatnet (OKV), for freshwater diatoms. Diatom assemblages showed an increase in the planktonic diatoms relative to benthic diatoms, with an onset towards higher abundances of small centric planktonic diatoms at OGF (between c. 5270 and 5350 cal. yr BP) and OKV (between c. 5280 and 5350 cal. yr BP). Additionally, a diatom compositional shift was detected at LCJ between c. 5180 and 5300 cal. yr BP. Trend analysis found the main diatom compositional change at all three sites to occur at 5300 cal. yr BP. However, this synchronous diatom shift during the mid-Holocene varies in magnitude within the three Finnmark lakes. The abrupt planktonic:benthic diatom ratio changes are independent of the Pinus:Betula ratios and are likely to be a result of lake ice-cover changes, allowing longer growing seasons, greater water column stability and higher nutrient concentrations from surrounding catchments. This study highlights the significant differences in aquatic ecosystem and terrestrial vegetation response to climatic changes, with diatom assemblages at these sites either responding before the regional tree-line shift or to a separate climatic event within the mid-Holocene.

TI  - Differential responses for stream algal assemblages exposed to factorial N and P enrichment along an in situ DOC gradient
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment from the surrounding landscape can enhance the growth and abundance of algal assemblages, both suspended in the water column and occurring as benthic biofilms in the receiving waters of resident stream ecosystems. However, it is unclear how enhanced levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) might mediate the response of algae to nutrients. In this study, we aim to understand the relationship between N and P enrichment in stream reaches with varying levels of DOC within a common watershed. Both suspended and benthic algal assemblages were exposed to increasing (low, moderate, high) levels of N and P in an <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> 3 × 3 factorial experimental design. Experiments were carried out simultaneously at three sites of varying DOC concentration, the results of which, showed that both assemblages responded very differently to enrichment. For suspended algae, biomass was enhanced following enrichment with both N and P singularly and in combination, particularly at the highest concentrations levels for both nutrients (3-way ANOVA interactions; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05). This pattern was consistent at all levels of DOC at the three sites (3-way ANOVA Nutrient-site interaction; F = 1.4, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.228). In contrast, benthic algal biomass progressively increased with enhanced concentration of both N and P, but only at the lowest level of DOC (3-way ANOVA site term; F = 84.2, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.0001). No appreciable biomass accumulation was observed under moderate or high DOC conditions and this pattern was likely attributed to low light penetration at these two sites (ANOVA). Our results indicate that eutrophication is likely to manifest itself in a complex manner throughout watersheds where loading of N and P interacts with DOC.</jats:p>

TI  - Relationships between colored dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon in different coastal gradients of the Baltic Sea
PY  - 2015
AB  - Due to high terrestrial runoff, the Baltic Sea is rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the light-absorbing fraction of which is referred to as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Inputs of DOC and CDOM are predicted to increase with climate change, affecting coastal ecosystems. We found that the relationships between DOC, CDOM, salinity, and Secchi depth all differed between the two coastal areas studied; the W Gulf of Bothnia with high terrestrial input and the NW Baltic Proper with relatively little terrestrial input. The CDOM:DOC ratio was higher in the Gulf of Bothnia, where CDOM had a greater influence on the Secchi depth, which is used as an indicator of eutrophication and hence important for Baltic Sea management. Based on the results of this study, we recommend regular CDOM measurements in monitoring programmes, to increase the value of concurrent Secchi depth measurements.

TI  - Species sorting along a subsidy gradient alters bacterial community stability
PY  - 2016
AB  - The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects of terrestrial inputs on aquatic bacterial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in relative abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active bacterial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in relative abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies bacterial community stability through functional not structural changes. Together, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Experimental whole-lake increase of dissolved organic carbon concentration produces unexpected increase in crustacean zooplankton density.
PY  - 2016
AB  - The observed pattern of lake browning, or increased terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, across the northern hemisphere has amplified the importance of understanding how consumer productivity varies with DOC concentration. Results from comparative studies suggest these increased DOC concentrations may reduce crustacean zooplankton productivity due to reductions in resource quality and volume of suitable habitat. Although these spatial comparisons provide an expectation for the response of zooplankton productivity as DOC concentration increases, we still have an incomplete understanding of how zooplankton respond to temporal increases in DOC concentration within a single system. As such, we used a whole-lake manipulation, in which DOC concentration was increased from 8 to 11 mg L(-1) in one basin of a manipulated lake, to test the hypothesis that crustacean zooplankton production should subsequently decrease. In contrast to the spatially derived expectation of sharp DOC-mediated decline, we observed a small increase in zooplankton densities in response to our experimental increase in DOC concentration of the treatment basin. This was due to significant increases in gross primary production and resource quality (lower seston carbon-to-phosphorus ratio; C:P). These results demonstrate that temporal changes in lake characteristics due to increased DOC may impact zooplankton in ways that differ from those observed in spatial surveys. We also identified significant interannual variability across our study region, which highlights potential difficulty in detecting temporal responses of organism abundances to gradual environmental change (e.g., browning).

TI  - Seasonal dynamics in the trophic status of water, floral and faunal density along some selected coastal areas of the Red Sea, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia
PY  - 2015
AB  - Eutrophication is posing a threat to the coastal marine ecosystems. The consequence of anthropogenic induced eutrophication of waters has resulted in severe deterioration of surface waters. In this research a preliminary data was collected on eutrophication by environmental monitoring on some selected coastal areas of the Red Sea near Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Sampling sites were selected from Haql, Sharmaa and Duba (five for each station) and water samples collected in four different seasons (Oct 2013, Jan 2014, April 2014 and July 2014) to study seasonal dynamics of water quality parameters (especially in reference to the trophic status of water). Only one coastal site from each station was found with some eutrophic characteristics. Water samples collected from these eutrophic sites were more alkaline, turbid, with higher nutrient and low dissolved oxygen contents as compared to other sampling sites. Dynamics in relative densities of coastal flora and fauna were also found to be related with coastal water quality. Human settlements, fish markets, boating clubs and tourisms near these coastal areas of the Red Sea were observed as the primary causes of nutrient loading; run-offs during rains carrying nutrients also aggravate the problem. The results of this study may help in estimating the intensity of the problem and as a forecast for time frame to take an action for the conservation of affected coastal marine ecosystems and restoration of degraded coastal areas of the Red Sea.

TI  - Traces of sunlight in the organic matter biogeochemistry of two shallow subarctic lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Global environmental change alters the production, terrestrial export, and photodegradation of organic carbon in northern lakes. Sedimentary biogeochemical records can provide a unique means to understand the nature of these changes over long time scales, where observational data fall short. We deployed in situ experiments on two shallow subarctic lakes with contrasting light regimes; a clear tundra lake and a dark woodland lake, to first investigate the photochemical transformation of carbon and nitrogen elemental (C/N ratio) and isotope (δ13C, δ15N) composition in lake water particulate organic matter (POM) for downcore inferences. We then explored elemental, isotopic, and spectral (inferred lake water total organic carbon [TOC] and sediment chlorophyll a [CHLa]) fingerprints in the lake sediments to trace changes in aquatic production, terrestrial inputs and photodegradation before and after profound human impacts on the global carbon cycle prompted by industrialization. POM pool in both lakes displayed tentative evidence of UV photoreactivity, reflected as increasing δ13C and decreasing C/N values. Through time, the tundra lake sediments traced subtle shifts in primary production, while the woodland lake carried signals of changing terrestrial contributions, indicating shifts in terrestrial carbon export but possibly also photodegradation rates. Under global human impact, both lakes irrespective of their distinct carbon regimes displayed evidence of increased productivity but no conspicuous signs of increased terrestrial influence. Overall, sediment biogeochemistry can integrate a wealth of information on carbon regulation in northern lakes, while our results also point to the importance of considering the entire spectrum of photobiogeochemical fingerprints in sedimentary studies.

TI  - Littoral-benthic primary production estimates: Sensitivity to simplifications with respect to periphyton productivity and basin morphometry
PY  - 2015
AB  - Periphyton is a critical energy source for consumers in lakes of all sizes, but estimates of average, area-specific littoral zone benthic primary production (LBP) have been hampered by low spatial and temporal resolution of productivity data. We analyzed the sensitivity of estimates of LBP to depth-specific variation in photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) parameters and temporal variation in water clarity using monitoring data from five northern temperate lakes. Maximum photosynthesis rates peaked in the upper epilimnion in all five lakes, and our best daily estimates of LBP ranged from 125 mg C m−2 d−1 to 425 mg C m−2 d−1. Nonlinear variation in maximum photosynthesis (PMAX) with depth caused overestimates in LBP by an average of 10% when mean values of PMAX were applied throughout the euphotic zone. Conversely, applying values of light levels at onset of saturation (Ek) from the upper epilimnion resulted in underestimating LBP by an average of 19% compared with the most data-rich (optimal) calculations. Simplified approximations of bathymetry yielded underestimates or overestimates of LBP, depending on basin shape. Incorporating temporal variation in water clarity and daily solar irradiance did not substantially improve estimates of average summer LBP compared with estimates that incorporated summer average values of Kd, but this result should not be extrapolated to lakes with more variable water clarity. Estimates of average littoral zone benthic primary production can be optimized by incorporating depth-specific variation in maximum periphyton productivity, saturation light intensity, and sediment surface area into calculations.

TI  - Meteorological drivers of the dynamics of autotrophic picoplankton
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. The tiny non-motile autotrophic picoplankton (APP; size range 0.2–2 μm) occur in all types of aquatic habitats and are comprised of prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic taxa. In the Boreal Zone, the majority of lakes have high concentrations of coloured humic substances that can adversely affect lake light climate and cause steep summertime stratification resulting in epilimnetic nutrient depletion. APP are more effective in nutrient and light acquisition than larger phytoplankton and thus should be competitive in humic lakes. 2. Most lacustrine APP studies have been based on short sampling periods, and thus, interannual variation and its drivers are still unclear. We studied APP in the small, boreal, humic Lake Valkea-Kotinen during five open-water periods in 2002–06 to determine interannual variation and the importance of meteorological drivers for APP dynamics. 3. Total APP showed a bimodal annual pattern, but the timing and vertical location of the two maxima varied during the study. In general, APP thrived in warm water and the most important abiotic factor controlling APP was stability of the water column (Ns). On average, 82% of APP were found in the epilimnion or metalimnion during summertime stratification. 4. There was niche separation of APP and larger phytoplankton in the lake because, with only one exception, APP maxima occurred separately from the maxima of larger phytoplankton. 5. Two groups, solitary eukaryotic APP and colonial picocyanobacteria (Merismopedia warmingiana), responded differently to the abiotic factors. Solitary APP preferred high water colour and low pH, both of which occurred after heavy rain, whereas colonial APP did not fare well when water colour was high. Our findings suggest that when future climate change-related processes increase incoming allocthonous organic matter load from the catchment, solitary eukaryotic APP will be favoured.

TI  - Factors influencing the acid-base (pH) balance in the Baltic Sea: a sensitivity analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Using calculations based on the marine carbon system and on modelling, the sensitivity of Baltic Sea surface pH was examined. Transient long-term calculations demonstrated that the marine carbon system adjusts to lateral boundary conditions within some decades, as does salinity. Climate changes in temperature or salinity will only marginally affect the acid–base (pH) balance. Wetter or dryer climate will also play a minor role in the pH balance. The direct effect on seawater pH of acid precipitation over the Baltic Sea surface was demonstrated to be small. Acidification due to river transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the marine system seems marginal although mineralization of terrestrial DOC may cause extra marine acidification, but the effect has yet to be quantified. Increased nutrient load may increase the amplitude in the pH seasonal cycle and increase the acidification during winter time. Fossil fuel burning is likely to have both a direct and indirect effect through increased CO 2 levels, altering seawater pH as well as changing the river chemistry. This may severely threaten some species in the Baltic Sea, particularly in the Northern Baltic. DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00463.x

TI  - Fish foraging under visual constraints
PY  - 2012
AB  - Visual conditions are changing in several different ways. Some lakes are getting turbid due to eutrophication or erosion while others are getting browner due to brownification. These two types of visual degradation results in completely different optical properties of lakes. Turbid water scatter light which degrades image quality severely while brown coloured humic water mainly absorb light making the aquatic environment darker. In juvenile fish, the effects seem to be similar between turbid and humic water where foraging of planktivorous life stages are largely unaffected. However, prey selectivity in juvenile fish may change as red carotenoid pigmentation in copepod zooplankton make them more conspicuous in turbid water while transparent copepods are selected by the fish in humic water. The pigments, that are usually used for UV-protection in clear water, may therefore make the pigmented copepod cryptic in humic water, explaining the presence of the pigments even in brown waters where UV-radiation is very low. Piscivorous juvenile fish experience negative effects of visual degradation, including reduced reaction distance which reduces the search efficiency and encounter rate for the predator. Juvenile pike (Esox lucius) are able to counteract the reduced encounter rate with increased attack rate and thereby probably also higher foraging effort. This increase in foraging effort when foraging on fish prey may reduce the benefit of ontogenetic diet switches and thereby have consequences for growth and recruitment in fish populations. Foraging in adult fish depend heavily on visual conditions. For adult fish, image quality is important, resulting in that prey size selectivity collapses completely in turbid water. In clear water pike consistently selects small prey to reduce handling time to a minimum. This selectivity for small prey are maintained in brown humic water. Lost selectivity in turbid water and thereby capture of larger prey than necessary, increases the handling time of prey, and thereby the exposure of pike to cannibalistic and cleptoparasitic conspecifics. However, the most pronounced foraging cycle effect of visual degradation is the reduced reaction distance that lowers the search efficiency of the predator and thereby possibly the encounter rate with prey. Decreased encounter rates was however not counteracted by increased search activity. The importance of the visual conditions for the encounter rate is also implied when growth rate of perch (Perca fluviatilis) was evaluated before and after biomanioulation in Lake Finjasjon. A 10-fold decrease in prey density after biomanipulation is completely counteracted by improved visual conditions where Secchi depth increased from 0.35 m before to 1.16 m after biomanipulaton. This resulted in increased growth in the predator, probably due to increased encounter rate, despite the 10-fold decrease in prey density.

TI  - Effects of water clarity and other environmental factors on trophic niches of two sympatric piscivores
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary Water clarity can have a profound influence on aquatic ecosystem structure and processes via its effects on physical habitat (e.g., thermal regime, macrophyte density) and behavioural responses of biota (e.g., predator avoidance, reaction distances, foraging efficiency). Changes in foraging efficiencies under varying water clarity conditions are well documented for many freshwater piscivores in laboratory studies, but the influence of visual foraging conditions on interspecific trophic dynamics is poorly understood in wild populations, especially within water clarity ranges that are realistic for north-temperate boreal lakes. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen (15N/14N) and carbon (13C/12C) in fish muscle tissue to investigate how resource partitioning between two sympatric visual piscivores is related to water clarity and other habitat variables in 28 small (100–200 ha) Boreal Shield lakes. One of the species is adapted for foraging in low subsurface illumination (walleye, Sander vitreus) and the other in high subsurface illumination (smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu). Trophic niche dimensions of the dark-adapted predator did not respond significantly to differences in water clarity. In contrast, total isotopic niche space of the light-adapted predator decreased significantly with increasing water clarity through greater use of pelagic resources and a narrower range of trophic levels, although these relationships were weak. Niche overlap ranged from 0 to 65%, but was not significantly related to water clarity. Rather, indices of prey availability appeared to be much stronger predictors of trophic interactions. Both species occupied more similar food-web positions when yellow perch (Perca flavescens) abundance was higher, and had more similar niche size and trophic evenness with decreasing prey fish species richness. Results indicate that the trophic ecology of predators adapted to foraging in low light conditions is less influenced by water clarity than that of predators adapted to foraging in high light conditions. However, prey availability, rather than the environmental conditions in which foraging occurs, may be a more important driver of resource partitioning among generalists even when light conditions favour one species’ foraging strategy over another.

TI  - Periphyton support for littoral secondary production in a highly humic boreal lake
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractSteep stratification and poor light penetration in highly humic lakes typically restrict oxygenated littoral areas to narrow lake margins. However, in some instances, surrounding floating vegetation mats can sustain highly productive periphyton and more diverse invertebrate communities than pelagic areas. Little is known about how these littoral food webs function or the extent to which the pelagic and littoral food webs are coupled. We added 15N-labeled ammonium nitrate to the floating moss mat surrounding the littoral zone of Mekkojarvi, a small highly humic and fishless lake in southern Finland. Our goal was to increase the δ15N values of periphyton to investigate the diets of littoral invertebrates and possible pelagic–littoral coupling in the lake. We divided the lake in 2 with a plastic curtain and added European Perch (Perca fluviatilis) to 1 basin while the other remained fishless. δ15N of periphyton and most littoral invertebrates increased well above the natural abundance levels. δ15N of...

TI  - Development of photosynthetic carbon fixation model using multi-excitation wavelength fast repetition rate fluorometry in Lake Biwa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Direct measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the water column are essential, but can be spatially and temporally restrictive. Fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf) is a bio-optical technique based on chlorophyll a (Chl-a) fluorescence that can estimate the electron transport rate (ETRPSII) at photosystem II (PSII) of phytoplankton in real time. However, the derivation of phytoplankton GPP in carbon units from ETRPSII remains challenging because the electron requirement for carbon fixation (Фe,C), which is mechanistically 4 mol e- mol C-1 or above, can vary depending on multiple factors. In addition, FRRf studies are limited in freshwater lakes where phosphorus limitation and cyanobacterial blooms are common. The goal of the present study is to construct a robust Фe,C model for freshwater ecosystems using simultaneous measurements of ETRPSII by FRRf with multi-excitation wavelengths coupled with a traditional carbon fixation rate by the 13C method. The study was conducted in oligotrophic and mesotrophic parts of Lake Biwa from July 2018 to May 2019. The combination of excitation light at 444, 512 and 633 nm correctly estimated ETRPSII of cyanobacteria. The apparent range of Фe,C in the phytoplankton community was 1.1-31.0 mol e- mol C-1 during the study period. A generalised linear model showed that the best fit including 12 physicochemical and biological factors explained 67% of the variance in Фe,C. Among all factors, water temperature was the most significant, while photosynthetically active radiation intensity was not. This study quantifies the in situ FRRf method in a freshwater ecosystem, discusses core issues in the methodology to calculate Фe,C, and assesses the applicability of the method for lake GPP prediction.

TI  - Browning of Boreal Freshwaters Coupled to Carbon-Iron Interactions along the Aquatic Continuum
PY  - 2014
AB  - The color of freshwaters, often measured as absorbance, influences a number of ecosystem services including biodiversity, fish production, and drinking water quality. Many countries have recently reported on increasing trends of water color in freshwaters, for which drivers are still not fully understood. We show here with more than 58000 water samples from the boreal and hemiboreal region of Sweden and Canada that absorbance of filtered water (a420) co-varied with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (R2 = 0.85, P<0.0001), but that a420 relative to DOC is increased by the presence of iron (Fe). We found that concentrations of Fe significantly declined with increasing water retention in the landscape, resulting in significantly lower Fe concentrations in lakes compared to running waters. The Fe loss along the aquatic continuum corresponded to a proportional loss in a420, suggesting a tight biogeochemical coupling between colored dissolved organic matter and Fe. Since water is being flushed at increasing rates due to enhanced runoff in the studied regions, diminished loss of Fe along the aquatic continuum may be one reason for observed trends in a420, and in particular in a420/DOC increases. If trends of increased Fe concentrations in freshwaters continue, water color will further increase with various effects on ecosystem services and biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Recent advancement in water quality indicators for eutrophication in global freshwater lakes
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Eutrophication is a major global concern in lakes, caused by excessive nutrient loadings (nitrogen and phosphorus) from human activities and likely exacerbated by climate change. Present use of indicators to monitor and assess lake eutrophication is restricted to water quality constituents (e.g. total phosphorus, total nitrogen) and does not necessarily represent global environmental changes and the anthropogenic influences within the lake’s drainage basin. Nutrients interact in multiple ways with climate, basin conditions (e.g. socio-economic development, point-source, diffuse source pollutants), and lake systems. It is therefore essential to account for complex feedback mechanisms and non-linear interactions that exist between nutrients and lake ecosystems in eutrophication assessments. However, the lack of a set of water quality indicators that represent a holistic understanding of lake eutrophication challenges such assessments, in addition to the limited water quality monitoring data available. In this review, we synthesize the main indicators of eutrophication for global freshwater lake basins that not only include the water quality constituents but also the sources, biogeochemical pathways and responses of nutrient emissions. We develop a new causal network (i.e. multiple links of indicators) using the DPSIR (drivers-pressure-state-impact-response) framework that highlights complex interrelationships among the indicators and provides a holistic perspective of eutrophication dynamics in freshwater lake basins. We further review the 30 key indicators of drivers and pressures using seven cross-cutting themes: (i) hydro-climatology, (ii) socio-economy, (iii) land use, (iv) lake characteristics, (v) crop farming and livestock, (vi) hydrology and water management, and (vii) fishing and aquaculture. This study indicates a need for more comprehensive indicators that represent the complex mechanisms of eutrophication in lake systems, to guide the global expansion of water quality monitoring networks, and support integrated assessments to manage eutrophication. Finally, the indicators proposed in this study can be used by managers and decision-makers to monitor water quality and set realistic targets for sustainable water quality management to achieve clean water for all, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6.</jats:p>

AB  - Despite the small continental coverage of lakes, they are hotspots of carbon cycling, largely due to the processing of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). As DOM is an amalgam of heterogeneous compounds comprising gradients of microbial and physicochemical reactivity, the factors influencing DOM processing at the molecular level and the resulting patterns in DOM composition are not well understood. Here we show, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 4,032 molecular formulae in 120 lakes across Sweden, that the molecular composition of DOM is shaped by precipitation, water residence time and temperature. Terrestrially derived DOM is selectively lost as residence time increases, with warmer temperatures enhancing the production of nitrogen-containing compounds. Using biodiversity concepts, we show that the molecular diversity of DOM, or chemodiversity, increases with DOM and nutrient concentrations. The observed molecular-level patterns indicate that terrestrially derived DOM will become more prevalent in lakes as climate gets wetter.

TI  - Climate and productivity affect total mercury concentration and bioaccumulation rate of fish along a spatial gradient of subarctic lakes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Climate change is resulting in increased temperatures and precipitation in subarctic regions of Europe. These changes are extending tree lines to higher altitudes and latitudes, and enhancing tree growth enabling intensification of forestry into previously inhospitable subarctic regions. The combined effects of climate change and land-use intensification extend the warm, open-water season in subarctic lakes and increase lake productivity and may also increase leaching and methylation activity of mercury within the lakes. To assess the joint effects of climate and productivity on total mercury (THg) bioaccumulation in fish, we conducted a space-for-time substitution study in 18 tributary lakes of a subarctic watercourse forming a gradient from cold pristine oligotrophic lakes in the northern headwaters to warmer and increasingly human-altered mesotrophic and eutrophic systems in the southern lower reaches. Increasing temperature, precipitation, and lake productivity were predicted to elevate length- and age-adjusted THg concentrations, as well as THg bioaccumulation rate (the rate of THg bioaccumulation relative to length or age) in muscle tissue of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), vendace (Coregonus albula), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua). A significant positive relationship was observed between age-adjusted THg concentration and lake climate-productivity in vendace (r2 = 0.50), perch (r2 = 0.51), pike (r2 = 0.55) and roach (r2 = 0.61). Higher climate-productivity values of the lakes also had a positive linear (pike; r2 = 0.40 and whitefish; r2 = 0.72) or u-shaped (perch; r2 = 0.64 and ruffe; r2 = 0.50) relationship with THg bioaccumulation rate. Our findings of increased adjusted THg concentrations in planktivores and piscivores reveal adverse effects of warming climate and increasing productivity on these subarctic fishes, whereas less distinct trends in THg bioaccumulation rate suggest more complex underlying processes. Joint environmental stressors such as climate and productivity should be considered in ongoing and future monitoring of mercury concentrations.

TI  - The success of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in freshwaters is enhanced by the combined effects of light intensity and temperature
PY  - 2016
AB  - Toxic cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters are thought to be a consequence of the combined effects of anthropogenic eutrophication and climate change. It is expected that climate change will affect water mixing regimes that alter the water transparency and ultimately the light environment for phytoplankton. Blooms of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are expanding from tropical towards temperate regions. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this expansion, including an increase in water temperature due to climate change and the high phenotypic plasticity of the species that allows it to exploit different light environments. We performed an analysis based on eight lakes in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions to examine the distribution and abundance of C. raciborskii in relation to water temperature and transparency. We then conducted a series of short-term factorial experiments that combined three temperatures and two light intensity levels using C. raciborskii cultures alone and in interaction with another cyanobacterium to identify its growth capacity. Our results from the field, in contrast to predictions, showed no differences in dominance (>40% to the total biovolume) of C. raciborskii between climate regions. C. raciborskii was able to dominate the phytoplankton in a wide range of light environments (euphotic zone = 1.5 to 5 m, euphotic zone/mixing zone ratio 1.5). Moreover, C. raciborskii was capable of dominating the phytoplankton at low temperatures (<15°C). Our experimental results showed that C. raciborskii growing in interaction was enhanced by the increase of the temperature and light intensity. C. raciborskii growth in high light intensities and at a wide range of temperatures, suggests that any advantage that this species may derive from climate change that favors its dominance in the phytoplankton is likely due to changes in the light environment rather than changes in temperature. Predictive models that consider only temperature as a drive factor can therefore fail in predicting the expansion of this potentially toxic cyanobacterium.

TI  - Alleviating eutrophication by reducing the abundance of Cyanophyta due to dissolved inorganic carbon fertilization: Insights from Erhai Lake, China.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The eutrophication of lakes is a global environmental problem. Regulating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on phytoplankton is considered to be the most important basis of lake eutrophication management. Therefore, the effects of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) on phytoplankton and its role in mitigating lake eutrophication have often been overlooked. In this study, the relationships between phytoplankton and DIC concentrations, carbon isotopic composition, nutrients (N and P), and hydrochemistry in the Erhai Lake (a karst lake) were investigated. The results showed that when the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>) concentrations in the water were higher than 15 µmol/L, the productivity of phytoplankton was controlled by the concentrations of TP and TN, especially by that of TP. When the N and P were sufficient and the CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentrations were lower than 15 µmol/L, the phytoplankton productivity was controlled by the concentrations of TP and DIC, especially by that of DIC. Additionally, DIC significantly affected the composition of the phytoplankton community in the lake (p<0.05). When the CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentrations were higher than 15 µmol/L, the relative abundance of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta was much higher than those of harmful Cyanophyta. Thus, high concentrations of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> can inhibit harmful Cyanophyta blooms. During lake eutrophication, when controlling N and P, an appropriate increase in CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentrations by land-use changes or pumping of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> into water may reduce the proportion of harmful Cyanophyta and promote the growth of Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta, which may provide effectively assist in mitigating water quality deterioration in surface waters.

TI  - Food Web Architecture and Basal Resources Interact to Determine Biomass and Stoichiometric Cascades along a Benthic Food Web
PY  - 2011
AB  - Understanding the effects of predators and resources on primary producers has been a major focus of interest in ecology. Within this context, the trophic cascade concept especially concerning the pelagic zone of lakes has been the focus of the majority of these studies. However, littoral food webs could be especially interesting because base trophic levels may be strongly regulated by consumers and prone to be light limited. In this study, the availability of nutrients and light and the presence of an omnivorous fish (Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus) were manipulated in enclosures placed in a humic coastal lagoon (Cabiunas Lagoon, Macae – RJ) to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resource availability (nutrients and light) and food web configuration on the biomass and stoichiometry of periphyton and benthic grazers. Our findings suggest that light and nutrients interact to determine periphyton biomass and stoichiometry, which propagates to the consumer level. We observed a positive effect of the availability of nutrients on periphytic biomass and grazers' biomass, as well as a reduction of periphytic C∶N∶P ratios and an increase of grazers' N and P content. Low light availability constrained the propagation of nutrient effects on periphyton biomass and induced higher periphytic C∶N∶P ratios. The effects of fish presence strongly interacted with resource availability. In general, a positive effect of fish presence was observed for the total biomass of periphyton and grazer's biomass, especially with high resource availability, but the opposite was found for periphytic autotrophic biomass. Fish also had a significant effect on periphyton stoichiometry, but no effect was observed on grazers' stoichiometric ratios. In summary, we observed that the indirect effect of fish predation on periphyton biomass might be dependent on multiple resources and periphyton nutrient stoichiometric variation can affect consumers' stoichiometry.

TI  - Terrestrial organic matter and light penetration: Effects on bacterial and primary production in lakes
PY  - 2009
AB  - We investigated productivity at the basal trophic level in 15 unproductive lakes in a gradient ranging from clear-water to brown-water (humic) lakes in northern Sweden. Primary production and bacterial production in benthic and pelagic habitats were measured to estimate the variation in energy mobilization from external energy sources (primary production plus bacterial production on allochthonous organic carbon) along the gradient. Clear-water lakes were dominated by autotrophic energy mobilization in the benthic habitat, whereas humic lakes were dominated by heterotrophic energy mobilization in the pelagic habitat. Whole-lake (benthic + pelagic) energy mobilization was negatively correlated to the light-extinction coefficient, which was determined by colored terrestrial organic matter in the lake water. Thus, variation in the concentration of terrestrial organic matter and its light-absorbing characteristics exerts strong control on the magnitude, as well as on the processes and pathways, of energy mobilization in unproductive lakes. We suggest that unproductive lakes in general are sensitive to input of terrestrial organic matter because of its effects on basal energy mobilization in both benthic and pelagic habitats.

TI  - The effects of eutrophication and browning on prey availability and body growth of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Shallow coastal areas often have high productivity and diversity, in part due to the high availability of light and nutrients. At the same time, they are exposed to multiple environmental pressures, such as browning and eutrophication. Browning is mainly caused by runoff bringing coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), reducing light availability in waters, whereas eutrophication is caused by high nutrient loading, leading to eutrophication symptoms such as algal blooms. Existing variation and further change in light and nutrients of coastal areas could have large implications for aquatic food webs, including fish. For instance, reduced light might alter food availability and reduce foraging abilities, whereas increased nutrient supply might, depending on the extent, increase food availability. In this study, we performed a mesocosm experiment, including benthic and pelagic communities, together with young-of-the-year three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as predators. The three-spined stickleback is not only a common model organism but also an increasingly common and important mesopredator in the Baltic Sea. We examined the extent to which browning and nutrient-enrichment, alone and in combination, influenced the density, biomass, and composition of stickleback prey, and diet choice, body growth and condition of the stickleback. Stickleback body growth was positively affected by nutrient-enrichment, probably because of a positive bottom-up effect with increased primary production, as evident in the much higher chlorophyll-a concentrations in the pelagic habitat, and increased food availability. In contrast, there was a marginal negative effect of browning on stickleback body growth and condition, most likely due to negative effects of reduced visibility on feeding rates. We also found that prey availability increased with nutrient-enrichment but not with browning. Interestingly, nutrient-enrichment counteracted the negative effects of browning when combined. Our findings add novel understandings about the potential for both eutrophication and browning to affect coastal food webs and fish body growth in the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Shifts in Lake N:P Stoichiometry and Nutrient Limitation Driven by Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition
PY  - 2009
AB  - Human activities have more than doubled the amount of nitrogen (N) circulating in the biosphere. One major pathway of this anthropogenic N input into ecosystems has been increased regional deposition from the atmosphere. Here we show that atmospheric N deposition increased the stoichiometric ratio of N and phosphorus (P) in lakes in Norway, Sweden, and Colorado, United States, and, as a result, patterns of ecological nutrient limitation were shifted. Under low N deposition, phytoplankton growth is generally N-limited; however, in high-N deposition lakes, phytoplankton growth is consistently P-limited. Continued anthropogenic amplification of the global N cycle will further alter ecological processes, such as biogeochemical cycling, trophic dynamics, and biological diversity, in the world's lakes, even in lakes far from direct human disturbance.

TI  - Temperature controls organic carbon sequestration in a subarctic lake
PY  - 2016
AB  - Widespread ecological reorganizations and increases in organic carbon (OC) in lakes across the Northern Hemisphere have raised concerns about the impact of the ongoing climate warming on aquatic ecosystems and carbon cycling. We employed diverse biogeochemical techniques on a high-resolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern Finland (70°N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic warming. Coupled variation in the elemental and isotopic composition of the sediment and a proxy-based summer air temperature reconstruction tracked changes in aquatic production, depicting a decline during a cool climate interval between ~1700-1900 C.E. and a subsequent increase over the 20th century. OC accumulation rates displayed similar coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in aquatic production and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic content over the 20th century together with high inferred aquatic UV exposure imply that the 20th century increase in OC accumulation is primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial inputs. The changes in the supply of autochthonous energy sources were further reflected higher up the benthic food web, as evidenced by biotic stable isotopic fingerprints.

TI  - Bioavailable phosphorus in humic headwater streams in boreal Sweden
PY  - 2012
AB  - Bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) concentrations were determined nine times between April and October 2010 in two humic boreal headwater streams draining forest-and mire-dominated catchments. BAP was analyzed in a bioassay in which natural P-limited bacterioplankton grew with natural P as the sole P source. In both streams, approximately 90% of the BAP occurred as dissolved species (passing a 0.2-mu m filter), consisting partly of low-molecular-weight forms (passing a filter with nominal cutoff at 1 kDa) and partly of high-molecular-weight forms (passing a 0.2-mu m filter but not a 1-kDa filter). Concentrations of total dissolved BAP varied between 1 mu g L-1 and 14 mu g L-1, with the highest values in the middle of the summer. Compared to the forest stream, BAP concentrations were generally higher in the mire stream, where it occasionally amounted to nearly 50% of total P. Molybdate reactive phosphorus overestimated BAP considerably. Most of the BAP was in forms other than free orthophosphate. Temporal BAP variations showed no relationships with dissolved organic carbon (C) or iron but were positively related to air temperature and negatively related to the absorbance ratio (a254 : a365) of organic compounds in the water, indicating connections between terrestrial export of BAP and temperature-dependent terrestrial C metabolism. Concentrations of BAP can relieve stream bacteria from P limitation, and a significant share of BAP exported to streams can reach and be used in downstream lakes.

TI  - Dissolved Organic Carbon Dynamics Variability from Ponds Draining Different Landscapes in a Typical Agricultural Watershed
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters (rivers, reservoirs, lakes, and small ponds) plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle and affects global climate change. In addition, DOC is also a vital indicator of the water environment due to its multiple physical, chemical, and ecological roles. Lakes and ponds of small sizes are abundant on a global and regional scale, and a large increase in ponds is expected with global agricultural land expansion. However, the DOC characteristics of ponds in agricultural watersheds are still unclear, posing a challenge to better understanding the carbon cycle of inland waters. In this study, we explored the DOC variability and their influencing factors in ponds draining different landscapes in a typical agricultural watershed to address the issue. The field measurements over a year showed the DOC concentration varied among ponds draining different landscapes. Specifically, the mean DOC concentrations in the natural pond, sewage pond, aquaculture pond, and irrigation pond were (6.17 ± 1.49) mg/L, (12.08 ± 2.92) mg/L, (9.36 ± 2.92) mg/L, and (8.91 ± 2.71) mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, monthly measurements found the DOC varied across sampling dates. The DOC variability was positively correlated with nutrients, primary production, and precipitation, suggesting anthropogenic loadings, an internal production rate, and hydrological regime that regulated the substantial variability of DOC in these ponds at the watershed scale. Further, large pollutant discharge and high primary production led to peak DOC occurring in the sewage pond. Our results implied that more attention should be paid to ponds in agricultural watersheds to better understand the roles of inland waters in the global carbon cycle.</jats:p>

TI  - The emerging role of drought as a regulator of dissolved organic carbon in boreal landscapes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - One likely consequence of global climate change is an increased frequency and intensity of droughts at high latitudes. Here we use a 17-year record from 13 nested boreal streams to examine direct and lagged effects of summer drought on the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs from catchment soils. Protracted periods of drought reduced DOC concentrations in all catchments but also led to large stream DOC pulses upon rewetting. Concurrent changes in DOC optical properties and chemical character suggest that seasonal drying and rewetting trigger soil processes that alter the forms of carbon supplied to streams. Contrary to expectations, clearest drought effects were observed in larger watersheds, whereas responses were most muted in smaller, peatland-dominated catchments. Collectively, our results indicate that summer drought causes a fundamental shift in the seasonal distribution of DOC concentrations and character, which together operate as primary controls over the ecological and biogeochemical functioning of northern aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Subsidy or subtraction: how do terrestrial inputs influence consumer production in lakes?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Cross-ecosystem fluxes are ubiquitous in food webs and are generally thought of as subsidies to consumer populations. Yet external or allochthonous inputs may in fact have complex and habitat-specific effects on recipient ecosystems. In lakes, terrestrial inputs of organic carbon contribute to basal resource availability, but can also reduce resource availability via shading effects on phytoplankton and periphyton. Terrestrial inputs might therefore either subsidise or subtract from consumer production. We developed and parameterised a simple model to explore this idea. The model estimates basal resource supply and consumer production given lake-level characteristics including total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and consumer-level characteristics including resource preferences and growth efficiencies. Terrestrial inputs diminished primary production and total basal resource supply at the whole-lake level, except in ultra-oligotrophic systems. However, this system-level generalisation masked complex habitat-specific effects. In the pelagic zone, dissolved and particulate terrestrial carbon inputs were available to zooplankton via several food web pathways. Consequently, zooplankton production usually increased with terrestrial inputs, even as total whole-lake resource availability decreased. In contrast, in the benthic zone the dominant, dissolved portion of the terrestrial carbon load had predominantly negative effects on resource availability via shading of periphyton. Consequently, terrestrial inputs always decreased zoobenthic production except under extreme and unrealistic parameterisations of the model. Appreciating the complex and habitat-specific effects of allochthonous inputs may be essential for resolving the effects of cross-habitat fluxes on consumers in lakes and other food webs.

TI  - Removal of chromophoric dissolved organic matter under combined photochemical and microbial degradation as a response to different irradiation intensities.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Throughout the freshwater continuum, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and the colored fraction, Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM), are continuously being added, removed, and transformed, resulting in changes in the chromophoricity and lability of organic matter over time. We examined, experimentally, the effect of increasing irradiation-intensities on the combined photochemical and microbial degradation of CDOM and DOC. This was done by using a simulated mixed water column: aged water from a humic lake was exposed to four irradiation-intensities - representing winter, early and late spring, and summer conditions (0.10, 0.16, 0.36, and 0.58 W/m<sup>2</sup>) - and compared with dark controls over 37 days. We found a linear relationship between CDOM degradation and irradiation-intensities up to 0.36 W/m<sup>2</sup>; the degradation rate saturated at higher intensities, both at specific wavelengths and for broader intervals. After 37 days at high irradiation-intensity, CDOM absorption of irradiation at 340 nm had been reduced by 41%; 48% of DOC had been removed and DOC degradation continued to increase. Aromaticity (SUVA<sub>254</sub>) declined significantly over 37 days at the two lowest but not at the two highest UV- intensities; levels in unexposed control water remained constant. Direct observations of the humic lake showed that CDOM absorption of irradiation (340 nm) declined by 27% from winter to summer. A model based on hydrological CDOM input and CDOM degradation calculated from field measurements of UV-radiation and experimental CDOM degradation with UV-exposure from sunlight accurately predicted the annual course as observed in the lake. With no external CDOM input, 92% of the CDOM could be degraded in a year. The results support the notion that combined photochemical and microbial CDOM degradation can be remarkably higher in lakes than previously thought and that humic lakes retain their color due to light absorption by ongoing CDOM input.

Top-down control via grazing pressure by zooplankton also constrains primary production and primary production may simultaneously affect zooplankton. Few studies have addressed these bidirectional interactions. We used convergent cross-mapping (CCM), a numerical test of causal associations, to quantify the presence and direction of the causal relationships among environmental variables (light availability, surface water temperature, NO3 -N, and PO4 -P), phytoplankton community composition, primary production, and the abundances of five functional zooplankton groups (large cladocerans, small cladocerans, rotifers, calanoids, and cyclopoids) in Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow, hypereutrophic lake in Japan. CCM suggested that primary production was causally influenced by NO3 -N and phytoplankton community composition; there was no detectable evidence of a causal effect of zooplankton on primary production. Our results also suggest that rotifers and cyclopoids were forced by primary production, and cyclopoids were further influenced by rotifers. However, our CCM suggested that primary production was weakly influenced by rotifers (i.e., bidirectional interaction). These findings may suggest complex linkages between nutrients, primary production, and rotifers and cyclopoids, a pattern that has not been previously detected or has been neglected. We used linear regression analysis to examine the relationships between the zooplankton community and pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis), the most abundant planktivore and the most important commercial fish species in Lake Kasumigaura. The relative abundance of pond smelt was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of rotifers and cyclopoids, which were causally influenced by primary production. This finding suggests that bottom-up linkages between nutrient, primary production, and zooplankton abundance might be a key mechanism supporting high planktivore abundance in eutrophic lakes. Because increases in primary production and cyanobacteria blooms are likely to occur simultaneously in hypereutrophic lakes, our study highlights the need for ecosystem management to resolve the conflict between good water quality and high fishery production.

TI  - Limnological study on a newly built drinking water reservoir near Tirana, Albania
PY  - 2011
AB  - Bovilla Lake is a reservoir constructed 12 years ago for supplying the city of Tirana (Albania) mainly with drinking water. It has a surface area of 4.6 km2, a maximum depth of originally 60 m and is monomictic with a stratification period from early spring to end of October. The lake is oligotrophic with low nutrient concentrations (e.g. SRP in spring about 8 μg L − 1) and minor oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion during thermal stagnation. The lake is highly turbid due to severe particle import by several rivers during rain periods. This led to a massive deposition of sediments, lifting the maximum depth to 45 m in 2008. Furthermore, the photic zone reached hardly more than 10 m. Algal species diversity is high; however, diatoms from the genus Cyclotella dominate most of the year both in numbers and biomass. Our study describes for the first time the hydrography and limnology of the Bovilla Reservoir.

TI  - Vegetation transitions drive the autotrophy–heterotrophy balance in Arctic lakes
PY  - 2018
AB  - “Arctic greening” will alter vegetation quantity and quality in northern watersheds, with possible consequences for lake metabolic balance. We used paleolimnology from six Arctic lakes in Greenland, Norway, and Alaska to develop a conceptual model describing how climate-driven shifts in terrestrial vegetation (spanning herb to boreal forest) influence lake autotrophic biomass (as chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments). Major autotrophic transitions occurred, including (1) optimal production of siliceous algae and cyanobacteria/chlorophytes at intermediate vegetation cover (dwarf shrub and Betula; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) range of 2–4 mg L-1), below and above which UVR exposure (DOC; 4 mgL-1), respectively limit algal biomass, (2) an increase in potentially mixotrophic cryptophytes with higher forest cover and allochthonous carbon supply. Vegetation cover appears to influence lake autotrophs by changing influx of (colored) dissolved organic matter which has multiple interacting roles—as a photoprotectant—in light attenuation and in macronutrient (carbon, nitrogen) supply.

TI  - In-Lake Processes Offset Increased Terrestrial Inputs of Dissolved Organic Carbon and Color to Lakes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Increased color in surface waters, or browning, can alter lake ecological function, lake thermal stratification and pose difficulties for drinking water treatment. Mechanisms suggested to cause browning include increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron concentrations, as well as a shift to more colored DOC. While browning of surface waters is widespread and well documented, little is known about why some lakes resist it. Here, we present a comprehensive study of Malaren, the third largest lake in Sweden. In Malaren, the vast majority of water and DOC enters a western lake basin, and after approximately 2.8 years, drains from an eastern basin. Despite 40 years of increased terrestrial inputs of colored substances to western lake basins, the eastern basin has resisted browning over this time period. Here we find the half-life of iron was far shorter (0.6 years) than colored organic matter (A420 ; 1.7 years) and DOC as a whole (6.1 years). We found changes in filtered iron concentrations relate strongly to the observed loss of color in the western basins. In addition, we observed a substantial shift from colored DOC of terrestrial origin, to less colored autochthonous sources, with a substantial decrease in aromaticity (-17%) across the lake. We suggest that rapid losses of iron and colored DOC caused the limited browning observed in eastern lake basins. Across a wider dataset of 69 Swedish lakes, we observed greatest browning in acidic lakes with shorter retention times (< 1.5 years). These findings suggest that water residence time, along with iron, pH and colored DOC may be of central importance when modeling and projecting changes in brownification on broader spatial scales.

TI  - Trade-offs Between Light and Nutrient Availability Across Gradients of Dissolved Organic Carbon Lead to Spatially and Temporally Variable Responses of Lake Phytoplankton Biomass to Browning
PY  - 2021
AB  - Northern lakes are experiencing widespread increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that are likely to lead to changes in pelagic phytoplankton biomass. Pelagic phytoplankton biomass responds to trade-offs between light and nutrient availability. However, the influence of DOC light absorbing properties and carbon–nutrient stoichiometry on phytoplankton biomass across seasonal or spatial gradients has not been assessed. Here, we analyzed data from almost 5000 lakes to examine how the carbon–phytoplankton biomass relationship is influenced by seasonal changes in light availability, DOC light absorbing properties (carbon-specific visual absorbance, SVA420), and DOC–nutrient [total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)] stoichiometry, using TOC as a proxy for DOC. We found evidence for trade-offs between light and nutrient availability in the relationship between DOC and phytoplankton biomass [chlorophyll (chl)-a], with the shape of the relationship varying with season. A clear unimodal relationship was found only in the fall, particularly in the subsets of lakes with the highest TOC:TP. Observed trends of increasing TOC:TP and decreasing TOC:TN suggest that the effects of future browning will be contingent on future changes in carbon–nutrient stoichiometry. If browning continues, phytoplankton biomass will likely increase in most northern lakes, with increases of up to 76% for a 1.7 mg L−1 increase in DOC expected in subarctic regions, where DOC, SVA420, DOC:TN, and DOC:TP are all low. In boreal regions with higher DOC and higher SVA420, and thus lower light availability, lakes may experience only moderate increases or even decreases in phytoplankton biomass with future browning.

TI  - An Update on Sedimentary Pigments in Victoria Land Lakes (East Antarctica)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Antarctic ice-free areas contain lakes and ponds that have interesting limnological features and are of wide global significance as early warning indicators of climatic and environmental change. However, most limnological and paleolimnological studies in continental Antarctica are limited to certain regions. There are several ice-free areas in Victoria Land that have not yet been studied well. There is therefore a need to extend limnological studies in space and time to understand how different geological and climatic features affect the composition and biological activity of freshwater communities. With the aim of contributing to a better limnological characterization of Victoria Land, this paper reports data on sedimentary pigments (used to identify the main algal taxa) obtained through a methodology that is more sensitive and selective than that of previous studies. Analyses were extended to 48 water bodies in ice-free areas with differing lithology, latitude, and altitude, and with different ...

TI  - The influence of different recultivation techniques on primary production processes in a degraded urban lake
PY  - 2014
AB  - The study was conducted in Lake Dlugie located in Olsztyn, the Masurian Lake District. In the 1950s and in the 1960s, Lake Dlugie was used for 20 years as a collector of raw domestic and storm sewage. This has led to complete degradation of the lake. After preliminary protection measures implemented in the catchment, the lake was restored by artificial aeration and phosphorus inactivation methods. Long-term recultivation of the reservoir resulted in a significant and long-lasting improvement of the water quality. Before restoration, the average concentration of organic phosphorus in the surface water layer amounted to 0.166 mg Porg l−1 and of organic nitrogen — to 3.0 mg Norg l−1. After restoration, these values decreased to 0.058 mg Porg l−1 and 2.0 mg Norg l−1. The results obtained eight years after the recultivation of Lake Dlugie are extremely interesting. The amounts of chlorophyll a did not exceed 7 μg l−1, water transparency remained at a depth of 2.9 m, and BOD5 did not exceed 2 mg O2 l−1. These observations show that during implementation of recultivation treatments, only chemical parameters of the water significantly changed, while biological elements reacted to the treatments with some delay.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Relationships between chlorophyll-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (chl-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) concentrations and 16 physicochemical variables in temperate eutrophic Çygören and mesotrophic Ikizcetepeler reservoirs (Turkey) were determined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was used to simplify the complexity of relationships between water quality variables. Principal component scores (PCs) were used as independent variables in the multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) to predict chl-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> in both reservoirs. This procedure is called Principal Component Regression (PCR). In the eutrophic Çygören Reservoir, chl-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> was significantly (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) correlated with nitrite-nitrogen (NO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), ammonium-nitrogen (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>), phosphate (PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, Secchi disk transparency, total dissolved solids (TDS) and total phosphorus (TP). In the mesotrophic Ikizcetepeler Reservoir, chl-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> was significantly (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) correlated with TSS, NO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfate (SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>), TDS, pH and the Secchi disk. In the eutrophic Çaygören Reservoir, six PCs explained 71% of the total variation in the water quality, while in the mesotrophic Ikizcetepeler Reservoir, six PCs explained 75% of the variation. This study has shown that PCR is a more robust tool than direct MLR to simplify the relationships between water quality variables and to predict chl-<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentrations in temperate reservoirs with different trophic states.</jats:p>

TI  - Poor nutritional quality of primary producers and zooplankton driven by eutrophication is mitigated at upper trophic levels.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Eutrophication and rising water temperature in freshwaters may increase the total production of a lake while simultaneously reducing the nutritional quality of food web components. We evaluated how cyanobacteria blooms, driven by agricultural eutrophication (in eutrophic Lake Köyliöjärvi) or global warming (in mesotrophic Lake Pyhäjärvi), influence the biomass and structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities. In terms of the nutritional value of food web components, we evaluated changes in the ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of phytoplankton and consumers at different trophic levels. Meanwhile, the lakes did not differ in their biomasses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities, lake trophic status greatly influenced the community structures. The eutrophic lake, with agricultural eutrophication, had cyanobacteria bloom throughout the summer months whereas cyanobacteria were abundant only occasionally in the mesotrophic lake, mainly in early summer. Phytoplankton community differences at genus level resulted in higher arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content of seston in the mesotrophic than in the eutrophic lake. This was also reflected in the EPA and DHA content of herbivorous zooplankton (<i>Daphnia</i> and <i>Bosmina</i>) despite more efficient trophic retention of these biomolecules in a eutrophic lake than in the mesotrophic lake zooplankton. Planktivorous juvenile fish (perch and roach) in a eutrophic lake overcame the lower availability of DHA in their prey by more efficient trophic retention and biosynthesis from the precursors. However, the most efficient trophic retention of DHA was found with benthivorous perch which prey contained only a low amount of DHA. Long-term cyanobacterial blooming decreased the nutritional quality of piscivorous perch; however, the difference was much less than previously anticipated. Our result shows that long-term cyanobacteria blooming impacts the structure of plankton and fish communities and lowers the nutritional quality of seston and zooplankton, which, however, is mitigated at upper trophic levels.

TI  - Brownification on hold: What traditional analyses miss in extended surface water records
PY  - 2021
AB  - Widespread increases in organic matter (OM) content of surface waters, as measured by color and organic carbon (OC), are a major issue for aquatic ecosystems. Long-term monitoring programs revealed the issue of "brownification", with climate change, land cover changes and recovery from acidification all suspected to be major drivers or contributing factors. While many studies have focused on the impact and drivers, fewer have followed up on whether brownification is continuing. As time-series of OM data lengthen, conventional data-analysis approaches miss important information on when changes occur. To better identify temporal OM patterns during three decades (1990-2020) of systematic monitoring, we used generalized additive models to analyze 164 time-series from watercourses located across Sweden. Increases in OC that were widespread during 1990-2010 ceased a decade ago, and most color increases ceased 20 years ago. These findings highlight the need to reassess the understanding of brownification's spatial and temporal extent, as well as the tools used to analyze lengthening time series.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter mediates the effects of warming and inorganic nutrients on a lake planktonic food web
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Lakes are undergoing striking physicochemical changes globally, including co‐occurring increases in dissolved organic carbon and nutrient concentrations, water color, and surface temperature. Although several experimental studies of lake browning and warming have been conducted over the last decade, knowledge remains limited as to the structural and functional responses of multitrophic plankton communities, especially under environmentally relevant physicochemical conditions. Using reverse osmosis to manipulate naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM), we performed an enclosure experiment to evaluate the response of a planktonic food web (zooplankton–phytoplankton–bacterioplankton) to individual and combined increases in DOM and temperature, while accounting for changes in inorganic nutrients associated with DOM enrichment. We found that concomitant increases in DOM and temperature or inorganic nutrients elicited substantially greater biotic effects, but infrequently led to interactive effects. Overall, major plankton groups responded differently to manipulated factors, with most effects observed in standing stocks, community composition, and trophic structure, while metabolic (primary production and respiration) rates appeared to be generally less responsive. DOM enrichment had a clear stimulatory effect on phytoplankton, but weakly affected zooplankton. More specifically, DOM enrichment, alone or combined with inorganic nutrient amendments, decreased zooplankton : chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> ratios, implying a reduced trophic transfer efficiency and altered trophic structure. Warming generally increased bacterial abundance and cyanobacterial dominance, especially under DOM‐enriched conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that increasing local DOM, even by only ~ 2 mgC L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, can enhance plankton responses to rising temperature or inorganic nutrients in the near‐surface layer of a clearwater lake, with potential implications for ecosystems facing co‐occurring environmental changes.</jats:p>

TI  - Effects of fetch and dissolved organic carbon on epilimnion depth and light climate in small forest lakes in southern Sweden
PY  - 2010
AB  - We sampled small (0.03 to 3.3 km2 surface area) forest lakes in southern Sweden during two summers to investigate how concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and lake size influence epilimnion depth (ze) and light conditions in the epilimnion. ze increased with increasing fetch (square root of lake area) but did not decrease with increasing DOC concentration. This suggests greater importance of wind mixing in our study area than in areas with more continental climate, i.e., epilimnion-deepening wind mixing overrides the tendency for epilimnion depth to decrease with increasing DOC concentration. Extinction of photosynthetically active radiation was mainly caused by DOC. The euphotic zone was shallower in the first year than in the second, probably because of higher precipitation and lower solar irradiance in 2007, which together led to higher water color. Mean epilimnetic irradiance was low, especially in 2007, mainly because the increase in DOC did not lead to shallower epilimnia. Browning of lakes in southern Sweden, in combination with a predicted increase in the number of storm events, may lead to more severe light limitation of phytoplankton in small, nutrient-poor lakes, since it may not be accompanied by a compensatory shallowing of the epilimnion. As a consequence, lake ecosystems will become more heterotrophic, CO2-evasion to the atmosphere will increase, and fish production decrease.

TI  - The Future of Freshwater Macrophytes in a Changing World: Dissolved Organic Carbon Quantity and Quality and Its Interactions With Macrophytes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are confronted with the effects of climate change. One of the major changes is an increased concentration of aquatic carbon. Macrophytes are important in the aquatic carbon cycle and play as primary producers a crucial role in carbon storage in aquatic systems. However, macrophytes are affected by increasing carbon concentrations. The focus of this review lies on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), one of the most abundant forms of carbon in aquatic ecosystems which has many effects on macrophytes. DOC concentrations are rising; the exact cause of this increase is not known, although it is hypothesized that climate change is one of the drivers. The quality of DOC is also changing; for example, in urban areas DOC composition is different from the composition in natural watersheds, resulting in DOC that is more resistant to photo-degradation. Plants can benefit from DOC as it attenuates UV-B radiation, it binds potentially harmful heavy metals and provides CO2 as it breaks down. Yet plant growth can also be impaired under high DOC concentrations, especially by humic substances (HS). HS turn the water brown and attenuate light, which limits macrophyte photosynthesis at greater depths. This leads to lower macrophyte abundance and lower species diversity. HS form a wide class of chemicals with many different functional groups and they therefore have the ability to interfere with many biochemical processes that occur in freshwater organisms. Few studies have looked into the direct effects of HS on macrophytes, but there is evidence that HS can interfere with photosynthesis by entering macrophyte cells and causing damage. DOC can also affect reactivity of heavy metals, water and sediment chemistry. This indirectly affects macrophytes too, so they are exposed to multiple stressors that may have contradictive effects. Finally, macrophytes can affect DOC quality and quantity as they produce DOC themselves and provide a substrate to heterotrophic bacteria that degrade DOC. Because macrophytes take a key position in the aquatic ecosystem, it is essential to understand to what extent DOC quantity and quality in surface water are changing and how this will affect macrophyte growth and species diversity in the future.

TI  - Tracking overwintering areas of fish-eating birds to identify mercury exposure.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Migration patterns are believed to greatly influence concentrations of contaminants in birds due to accumulation in spatially and temporally distinct ecosystems. Two species of fish-eating birds, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) breeding in Lake Ontario were chosen to measure the impact of overwintering location on mercury concentrations ([Hg]). We characterized (1) overwintering areas using stable isotopes of hydrogen (δ2H) and band recoveries, and (2) overwintering habitats by combining information from stable isotopes of sulfur (δ34S), carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and δ2H in feathers grown during the winter. Overall, overwintering location had a significant effect on [Hg]. Both species showed high [Hg] in 13C-rich habitats. In situ production of Hg (e.g., through sulfate reducing bacteria in sediments) and allochthonous import could explain high [Hg] in birds visiting 13C-rich habitats. Higher [Hg] were found in birds with high δ2H, sugge...

TI  - Autochthonous resources are the main driver of consumer production in dystrophic boreal lakes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Dystrophic lakes are widespread in temperate regions and intimately interact with surrounding terrestrial ecosystems in energy and nutrient dynamics, yet the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous resources to consumer production in dystrophic lakes remains controversial. We argue that allochthonous organic matter quantitatively dominates over photosynthetic autotrophs in dystrophic lakes, but that autotrophs are higher in diet quality and more important for consumers as they contain essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In a field study, we tested the hypotheses that (1) autochthonous primary production is the main driver for consumer production, despite being limited by light availability and low nutrient supplies, and greater supply of allochthonous carbon, (2) the relative contribution of autotrophs to consumers is directly related to their tissue PUFA concentrations, and (3) methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) provide an energy alternative for consumers. Pelagic and benthic consumer taxa representing different trophic levels were sampled from five dystrophic lakes: isopod Asellus aquaticus, megalopteran Sialis lutaria ,d ipteran Chaoborus flavicans, and perch Perca fluviatilis. Based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, the relative contributions of autochthonous (biofilms and seston) and allochthonous (coarse particulate and dissolved organic matter) resources and MOB to these taxa were 47-79% ,9 - 44% and 7-12% respectively. Results from fatty acid (FA) analyses show that the relative x3- FA and PUFA concentrations increased with trophic level (Asellus , Sialis and Chaoborus , Perca). Also, eicosapentaenoic-acid (EPA), x3-FA and PUFA concentrations increased with the autochthonous contribution in consumers, i.e., a 47-79% biofilm and/or seston diet resulted in tissue EPA of 4.2-18.4, x3 FAs of 11.6-37.0 and PUFA of 21.6-61.0 mg/g dry mass. The results indicate that consumers in dystrophic lakes predominantly rely on energy from autotrophs and that their PUFA concentrations are dependent on the relative contribution of these autochthonous resources. The limited energy support from MOB suggests they are not negligible and are potentially an integral part of the food webs. Our findings show that autochthonous resources are the main driver of secondary production even in dystrophic lakes and offer new insights into the functioning of these ecosystems.

TI  - Increasing algal biomass in Lake Vänern despite decreasing phosphorus concentrations: A lake-specific phenomenon?
PY  - 2014
AB  - Algal blooms in lake waters are frequently associated with elevated nutrient levels, in particular phosphorus. Here we show, with long-term data from Sweden's largest lake, Lake Vanern, that total phytoplankton biomass has significantly increased since the 1980s at the same time as total phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen concentrations have significantly decreased (non-parametric Mann-Kendall test: P < 0.01). Lake Vanern was not the only lake showing such a pattern: evaluating long-term data from 13 small oligotrophic reference lakes revealed the same pattern. Other synchronous changes observed in Sweden's oligotrophic lakes included strongly decreasing sulfate concentrations and increasing water temperatures. We found that alkalinity, water temperatures, silica and sulfate concentrations were the strongest predictors for total phytoplankton biomass at all three sites in Lake Vanern when we used partial least squares regression models with 11 input variables. From our results, we suggest that decreasing a...

TI  - Utilizing the Effective Xanthophyll Cycle for Blooming of Ochromonas smithii and O. itoi (Chrysophyceae) on the Snow Surface
PY  - 2011
AB  - Snow algae inhabit unique environments such as alpine and high latitudes, and can grow and bloom with visualizing on snow or glacier during spring-summer. The chrysophytes Ochromonas smithii and Ochromonas itoi are dominant in yellow-colored snow patches in mountainous heavy snow areas from late May to early June. It is considered to be effective utilizing the xanthophyll cycle and holding sunscreen pigments as protective system for snow algae blooming in the vulnerable environment such as low temperature and nutrients, and strong light, however the study on the photoprotection of chrysophytes snow algae has not been shown. To dissolve how the chrysophytes snow algae can grow and bloom under such an extreme environment, we studied with the object of light which is one point of significance to this problem. We collected the yellow snows and measured photosynthetically active radiation at Mt. Gassan in May 2008 when the bloom occurred, then tried to establish unialgal cultures of O. smithii and O. itoi, and examined their photosynthetic properties by a PAM chlorophyll fluorometer and analyzed the pigment compositions before and after illumination with high-light intensities to investigate the working xanthophyll cycle. This experimental study using unialgal cultures revealed that both O. smithii and O. itoi utilize only the efficient violaxanthin cycle for photoprotection as a dissipation system of surplus energy under prolonged high-light stress, although they possess chlorophyll c with diadinoxanthin.

TI  - Current Browning of Surface Waters Will Be Further Promoted by Wetter Climate
PY  - 2016
AB  - Browning of surface waters because of increasing terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (OC) concentrations is a concern for drinking water providers and can impact land carbon storage. We show that positive trends in OC in 474 streams, lakes, and rivers in boreal and subarctic ecosystems in Norway, Sweden, and Finland between 1990 and 2013 are surprisingly constant across climatic gradients and catchment sizes (median, +1.4% year–1; interquartile range, +0.8–2.0% year–1), implying that water bodies across the entire landscape are browning. The largest trends (median, +1.7% year–1) were found in regions impacted by strong reductions in sulfur deposition, while subarctic regions showed the least browning (median, +0.8% year–1). In dry regions, precipitation was a strong and positive driver of OC concentrations, declining in strength moving toward high rainfall sites. We estimate that a 10% increase in precipitation will increase mobilization of OC from soils to freshwaters by at least 30%, demonstrating the ...

TI  - High abundances of the nuisance raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen in brown water lakes are associated with high concentrations of iron
PY  - 2018
AB  - Algal blooms occur frequently in lakes and oceans and the causes and consequences of those are often studied. In this study, we focus on a less well known type of algal bloom by the freshwater raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen. This species’ abundance and occurrence is increasing, especially in brown water lakes, the most abundant lake type in the boreal zone. The aim of the study was to investigate which environmental factors are associated with G. semen by statistical evaluation of field data of 95 Swedish lakes over five years. Although we found G. semen to be associated with dark waters it was, contrary to our expectations, mainly high concentrations of iron, and only to a lesser extent high TOC (total organic carbon) concentrations, that were associated with blooms of G. semen. In addition, high phosphorus concentrations and low pH also appear to facilitate G. semen blooms. We suggest that browning of lakes caused by increased iron concentrations may decrease net heterotrophy by fostering heavy algal blooms, i.e. the opposite to commonly assumed effects of increased DOM (dissolved organic matter).

TI  - Periphyton as a key diet source of essential fatty acids for macroinvertebrates across a nutrient and dissolved organic carbon gradient in boreal lakes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We studied how physiologically important long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in benthic macroinvertebrates (<jats:italic>Asellus aquaticus</jats:italic>, Chironomidae, and Oligochaeta) were related to those in periphyton and terrestrial organic matter (tree leaves), collected from littoral areas of 17 boreal lakes that differed in their dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) concentrations. We also analyzed fatty acid (FA)‐specific stable carbon isotopes (δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>FA</jats:sub>) to investigate the dietary origin (periphyton vs. terrestrial organic matter) of PUFA in the consumers. In contrast to periphyton, terrestrial organic matter was deprived of long‐chain PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but rich in short‐chain PUFA. The FA composition of macroinvertebrates was primarily taxon‐specific despite the large differences in DOC and nutrient concentrations of the lakes. An increase in DOC concentration had a negative impact on the EPA content of <jats:italic>Asellus</jats:italic>, chironomids, and oligochaetes as well as the total FA content of chironomids and oligochaetes. However, the FA content of macroinvertebrates was not related to lake total phosphorus concentrations, although the total FA and EPA content of periphyton increased with the trophic status of the study lakes. The δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>PUFA</jats:sub> values of macroinvertebrates were positively related with the δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>PUFA</jats:sub> of periphyton and weakly with δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>PUFA</jats:sub> of terrestrial leaf material. The results indicate that EPA in the studied macroinvertebrate taxa was mainly derived from an algal‐based diet and not via biosynthesis from allochthonous precursor FA. Thus, macroinvertebrate production in lakes may be limited by the available algae‐based food sources.</jats:p>

TI  - Natural revegetation of bog pools after peatland restoration involving ditch blocking—The influence of pool depth and implications for carbon cycling
PY  - 2013
AB  - Throughout the last two centuries peatlands have been subject to extensive drainage, typically through the digging of ditches. Ecosystem restoration now focusses on damming or infilling these ditches to increase biodiversity and to provide a range of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water provision. We surveyed 60 bog pools created following ditch blocking (alone) on a blanket bog in north Wales. Eighteen months after restoration the mean total pool vegetation cover was 76%. There was a strong negative relationship between pool depth and Eriophorum cover (r2 = 0.74), and a weaker positive relationship between depth and Sphagnum cover (r2 = 0.35). Observations showed that pools had been colonised by various invertebrate species. Pool dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were not connected to pool vegetation, suggesting that catchment-scale processes drive DOC. Other studies have shown that Eriophorum generates large methane fluxes, and that Sphagnum can act as a methane sink. Therefore we recommend that pools should be deeper than 0.5 m to give the greatest carbon benefit, whilst noting that this is unlikely to significantly affect DOC fluxes.

TI  - Experimental whole-lake dissolved organic carbon increase alters fish diet and density but not growth or productivity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Negative relationships between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and fish productivity have been reported from correlative studies across lakes, but to date there have not been experimental tests of these relationships. We increased the DOC concentration in a lake by 3.4 mg L-1, using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design, to quantify the effects on the productivity and population structure of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Greater DOC reduced the volume of the epilimnion, the preferred habitat of Largemouth Bass, resulting in increased bass density. The likelihood that adult bass had empty diets decreased despite this increase in bass density; diet composition also changed. There was no apparent change in bass growth or condition. Overall, there was no net change in Largemouth Bass productivity. However, changes in YOY and juvenile recruitment and feeding success suggest the possibility that future effects could occur. Our results are the first to examine the effects of an incr...

TI  - Color, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids effects on Secchi depth in lakes: implications for trophic state assessment.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Secchi depth (SD), a primary metric to assess trophic state, is controlled in many lakes by algal densities, measured as chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration. Two other optically related water quality variables also directly affect SD: non-algal suspended solids (SSNA ) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM, expressed as the absorption coefficient at 440 nm, a440 ). Using a database of ~1,460 samples from ~625 inland lake basins in Minnesota and two other Upper Midwest states, Wisconsin and Michigan, we analyzed relationships among these variables, with special focus on CDOM levels that influence SD values and the Minnesota SD standards used to assess eutrophication impairment of lakes. Log-transformed chl-a, total suspended solids (TSS), and SD were strongly correlated with each other; log(a440 ) had major effects on log(SD) but was only weakly correlated with log(chl-a) and log(TSS). Multiple regression models for log(SD) and 1/SD based on the three driving variables (chl-a, SSNA , and CDOM) explained ~80% of the variance in SD in the whole data set, but substantial differences in the form of the best-fit relationships were found between major ecoregions. High chl-a concentrations (> 50 μg/L) and TSS (> 20 mg/L) rarely occurred in lakes with high CDOM (a440 > ~4 m-1 ), and all lakes with a440 > 8 m-1 had SD ≤ 2.0 m despite low chl-a values ( ~ 4 m-1 . Thus, SD is not an accurate trophic state metric in moderately to highly colored lakes, and Minnesota's 2-m SD criterion should not be the sole metric to assess eutrophication impairment in warm/cool-water lakes of the Northern Lakes and Forest ecoregion. More generally, trophic state assessments using SD in regions with large landscape sources of CDOM need to account for effects of CDOM on SD.

TI  - Persistent and widespread long-term phosphorus declines in Boreal lakes in Sweden.
PY  - 2017
AB  - We present an analysis of long-term (1988-2013; 26years) total phosphorus (TP) concentration trends in 81 Swedish boreal lakes subject to minimal anthropogenic disturbance. Near universal increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and a widespread but hitherto unexplained decline in TP were observed. Over 50% of the lakes (n=42) had significant declining TP trends over the past quarter century (Sen's slope=2.5%y-1). These declines were linked to catchment processes related to changes in climate, recovery from acidification, and catchment soil properties, but were unrelated to trends in P deposition. Increasing DOC concentrations appear to be masking in-lake TP declines. When the effect of increasing DOC was removed, the small number of positive TP trends (N=5) turned negative and the average decline in TP increased to 3.9%y-1. The greatest relative TP declines occurred in already nutrient poor, oligotrophic systems and TP concentrations have reached the analytical detection limit (1μgL-1) in some lakes. In addition, ongoing oligotrophication may be exacerbated by increased reliance on renewable energy from forest biomass and hydropower. It is a cause of significant concern that potential impairments to lake ecosystem functioning associated with oligotrophication are not well handled by a management paradigm focused exclusively on the negative consequences of increasing phosphorus concentrations.

TI  - Effects of re-oligotrophication and climate warming on plankton richness and community stability in a deep mesotrophic lake
PY  - 2011
AB  - We studied the effects of re-oligotrophication and climate warming on plankton richness and community stability over a period of 30 years in the deep mesotrophic Lake Zurich (Switzerland). We assembled monthly time-series of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic richness, phytoplankton functional groups (species with similar functional traits) and physico-chemical environmental descriptors (temperature, conductivity, pH, P-PO43-, N-NO3-, light absorption). We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness.

TI  - Competitive exclusion along climate gradients: energy efficiency influences the distribution of two salmonid fishes
PY  - 2010
AB  - We tested the importance of thermal adaptations and energy efficiency in relation to the geographical distribution of two competing freshwater salmonid fish species. Presence–absence data for Arctic char and brown trout were obtained from 1502 Norwegian lakes embracing both temperature and productivity gradients. The distributions were contrasted with laboratory-derived temperature scaling models for food consumption, growth and energy efficiency. Thermal performances of the two species were almost identical. However, Arctic char exhibited double the growth efficiency (per unit of food) and appear to have out-competed brown trout from cold, low-productivity lakes, perhaps by scramble competition. Brown trout, for which previous reports have shown to be aggressive and dominant, have likely excluded the more energy-efficient Arctic char from relatively warm, productive lakes, perhaps by contest competition. Competitive interaction changing in outcome with lake productivity, rather than thermal performance, is likely a major determinant of the range distribution of the two species. Our study highlights the need for more focus on choice of relevant ecophysiological traits in ecological climate impact studies and species distribution modelling.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:list> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Terrestrial loads of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in recent years in many north temperate lakes, leading to widespread brownification. This process can profoundly alter the relative strength of planktonic and benthic primary production in lakes due to changes in light and nutrient availability. While most existing in situ studies of brownification focus on gradual decadal trends, short‐term flooding can induce rather sudden natural browning events in lakes.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>We investigated the recovery of a small, temperate, groundwater‐fed shallow lake from a strong natural flooding‐induced browning and nutrient loading event. We hypothesised that along with a return to pre‐flood lake water levels, DOC concentrations would return to pre‐flood concentrations due to bacterial and photolytic mineralisation and flocculation, while total phosphorus (TP) concentrations would show a delayed and potentially incomplete recovery due to sustaining effects of phytoplankton dominance on nutrient dynamics in the lake. Phytoplankton gross primary production (GPP), which surged in response to higher nutrient concentrations and a compressed mixing depth, was expected to follow the same recovery pattern as TP. Benthic periphyton GPP was expected to recover in tandem with improving light conditions.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>We measured post‐flood water levels, water chemistry, and summer pelagic and benthic GPP. The lake water level declined gradually, returning to pre‐flood levels within 4 years. As hypothesised, DOC concentrations initially declined rapidly, but remained 1.5‐fold higher (<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 22 mg/L) than pre‐flood values 3 years after peak browning. TP concentrations fluctuated greatly between seasons but remained generally elevated in subsequent years, being roughly double pre‐browning values (<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 130 µg/L) 3 years post‐flood. Measurements taken in 2019, 7 years after the initial browning event, showed both DOC and TP concentrations remaining at these elevated levels.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Across the intensive study period 3 years before and after peak browning (2010–2015), TP concentrations were positively correlated to summer phytoplankton biomass, while DOC and TP concentrations were negatively correlated to summer periphyton biomass and GPP. Accordingly, the lake's recovery period exhibited a decline of pelagic GPP and a partial recovery of summer periphyton biomass and production, although a full return to pre‐flood values was not recorded in either case. Whole‐lake areal summertime GPP increased due to browning and remained higher than before the browning event.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>This study provides a rare examination of differences in response rates between DOC, TP, and autotrophic structure in a shallow, temperate lake following a natural flood‐induced extreme browning event. The available data provide compelling evidence that browning events can produce lasting changes in the water chemistry, trophic status, and productive pathways of a lake, persisting beyond the lake's return to pre‐flood water levels. Such delayed or incomplete recoveries from flooding‐induced browning and nutrient loading may have consequences for regional and long‐term temporal trends in lake biogeochemistry, potentially contributing to the widespread phenomenon of incremental brownification.</jats:p></jats:list-item> </jats:list> </jats:p>

TI  - Observation of methanogenesis and potential iron-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane in old lake sediments, a study of two boreal forest lakes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Organic and inorganic carbon can enter inland waters in different ways, and often a considerable amount of this carbon is coming from terrestrial input. Once this terrestrial carbon enters a lake, the carbon may be degraded, mineralized or eventually buried in the sediment. Below the oxic zone of the sediment carbon may be used by archaea to produce methane (CH4). The CH4 can then diffuse up in the sediment and escape to the bottom waters, or the CH4 can be oxidized by bacteria using oxygen as an oxidant. There is also an anoxic process to oxidize CH4 (anaerobic oxidation of methane: AOM), using sulfate (SO4) and by recent findings also ferric iron (Fe(III)) as electron acceptors. In this study the main questions of interest were if CH4 is produced in deep (i.e. old) lake sediments and if CH4 is oxidized anaerobically using Fe(III). Two Swedish boreal forest lakes were studied, sediment profiles of CH4 were conducted in the field (down to 60 cm). Collected sediments were sliced anoxically at different depths and then analyzed for ferrous iron (Fe(II)), Fe(III) and SO4. Sediment from different depths was also incubated anoxic in order to test if CH4 production depends on sediment age. The results show that methanogenic activity occurs by degrading old carbon in deep boreal forest lake sediments, and that a certain part of this might then be oxidized anaerobically. However, all cores exposed a general trend of increasing CH4 concentrations with sediment depth, indicating that CH4 production in old sediment layers is greater than AOM. AOM could therefore only act as a partial sink for CH4 in anoxic deep sediments.

TI  - Sustainable farming of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is a salmonid that is well adapted to cold waters and is commonly farmed in open net cages. A breeding program has enabled a relatively large production in Sweden, providing a continuous supply of fresh fish to the market. Despite expansions and improvements of the Arctic charr farming industry during the last decade, there are still sustainability challenges to overcome. This doctoral thesis explores various methods for improving the sustainability of Arctic charr farming, such as alternative protein sources in the feed, a shortened production cycle through selective breeding and an adaptive feeding management model. A new feed composition, containing a protein mixture with ingredients that are not attractive for human consumption, was evaluated for Arctic charr. The feed consisted of Baltic Sea decontaminated fishmeal (Sprattus sprattus and Clupea harengus), Baltic Sea blue mussel meal (Mytilus edulis) and baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The new feed resulted in lower growth compared with fish fed a commercial-type control feed, likely due to a reduced digestibility caused by the baker’s yeast. However, a self-selection study revealed a preference for the new feed over the control feed. Additionally, consumers could not distinguish between fish that had been fed the new feed or the control feed. Possible family effects that the new feed may have on growth were also investigated, showing that selection for high growth on a commercial-type feed would also benefit a higher growth capacity on the new feed. Selective breeding of Arctic charr had clear positive effects on growth. After adjusting for changes of environmental factors within the hatchery, the growth improvement from the first generation to the current seventh generation was 11 % per generation and production time has been shortened by ten months. Selective breeding also affected seasonal growth patterns and Arctic charr from the seventh generation grew more during winter than previously, although the largest weight improvement between generations occurred during summer. A new growth capacity, and pattern, demands an adaptive feeding management model so that feed waste and environmental impacts can be minimized. A new model on the digestible energy need of Arctic charr and a seasonal growth capacity factor were developed and can together be used to calculate the daily feed allowance during different periods of the growth season.

TI  - UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy as a proxy for peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality: considerations on wavelength and absorbance degradation
PY  - 2014
AB  - Absorbance in the UV or visible spectrum (UV-vis) is commonly used as a proxy for DOC concentrations in waters draining upland catchments. To determine the appropriateness of different UV-vis measurements we used surface and pore water samples from two Welsh peatlands in four different experiments: (i) an assessment of single wavelength proxies (1 nm increments between 230–800 nm) for DOC concentration demonstrated that 254 nm was more accurate than 400 nm. The highest R2 values between absorbance and DOC concentration were generated using 263 nm for one sample set (R2 = 0.91), and 230 nm for the other three sample sets (respective R2 values of 0.86, 0.81, and 0.93). (ii) A comparison of different DOC concentration proxies, including single wavelength proxies, a two wavelength model, a proxy using phenolic concentration, and a proxy using the area under a UV spectrum at 250–350 nm. It was found that both a single wavelength proxy (≤263 nm) and a two wavelength model performed well for both pore water and surface water. (iii) An evaluation of the E2:E3, E2:E4, E4:E6 ratios, and SUVA (absorbance at 254 nm normalised to DOC concentration) as indicators of DOC quality showed that the E4:E6 ratio was subject to extensive variation over time, and was highly correlated between surface water and pore water, suggesting that it is a useful metric to determine temporal changes in DOC quality. (iv) A repeated weekly analysis over twelve weeks showed no consistent change in UV-vis absorbance, and therefore an inferred lack of degradation of total DOC in samples that were filtered and stored in the dark at 4 °C.

TI  - Accounting for littoral primary production by periphyton shifts a highly humic boreal lake towards net autotrophy
PY  - 2016
AB  - The prevailing view that many humic lakes are net heterotrophic is commonly based on pelagic measurements alone. Poor light conditions in humic lakes are assumed to constrain littoral primary production (PP), such that the littoral zone has been considered an insignificant contributor to whole-lake PP. However, that assumption is based on models and inferences from pelagic processes which do not take littoral zone structure into account. Many lakes have an extensive ring of aquatic vegetation lying near the water surface, which provides substratum for epiphytic algae under well- illuminated conditions. 2. We measured both pelagic and littoral PP and community respiration (CR) in Mekkoj€ a small, highly humic headwater lake, in southern Finland throughout the open water season in 2012. We used a 14 C incorporation technique to measure pelagic PP, while littoral PP was determined using changes in dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations during in situ incubations. We then estimated whole-lake PP and CR for both the littoral and pelagic zones. 3. We found that littoral PP usually dominated whole-lake PP, contributing >90% to total PP in summer. A mean pelagic production to respiration ratio (GPP : CR) of 0.4 clearly indicated strong net heterotrophy, but a value of 2.2 for the littoral zone indicated strong autotrophy. For both habitats combined, the mean whole lake GPP : CR was 1.6, indicating net autotrophy. 4. We suggest that littoral PP can contribute significantly to whole-lake PP even in highly humic lakes, and that the littoral contribution can shift some lakes which have been considered net heterotrophic to metabolic balance or even net autotrophy during the ice-free period. Small humic lakes like Mekkoj€ with rings of littoral vegetation are widespread, especially in the boreal zone, and at least for similar lakes, evaluating lake metabolism from pelagic measurements alone is likely to be misleading.

TI  - Light quality determines primary production in nutrient-poor small lakes.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The availability of nutrients for primary producers has long been thought to be the main limiting factor for primary productivity in nutrient-poor lake ecosystems. However, recent studies have indicated that the availability of light energy is also important. On the other hand, the amount of phototroph was reported to decrease in summer in Antarctic lakes, furthermore, the light environment underwater was shown containing high amount of ultraviolet energy in small Antarctic lakes. Here, we hypothesized that primary productivity is limited by not only nutrients and simple light quantity but also light quality in nutrient-poor lakes. Then, we investigate factors influencing primary production by benthic phototrophic communities in shallow nutrient-poor lakes. We examine the relationships between primary production in 17 Antarctic freshwater lakes and nutrient concentrations in lake and benthic water, temperature and light energy. Primary production is decreased by ultraviolet energy reaching the lake bed, showing that production is determined by light quality. We also correlate ultraviolet energy in lake water with the catchment area of each lake. Our results show that the underwater light environment has an important influence on primary production as a key limitation factor and is sensitive to materials in runoff from the surrounding environment for pristine lakes.

TI  - Increasing concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in browning boreal lakes is driven by nuisance alga Gonyostomum
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) promote browning of lakes, which alters the physicochemical properties of water and ecosystem functioning. However, browning‐induced changes in basal production of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the n‐3 and n‐6 families (n‐3 and n‐6 PUFA) in lakes are not fully understood. The concentrations of PUFA, which are micronutrients required to maintain growth and reproduction of consumers, have been suggested to either rise or decline in seston as a response to lake browning. Elevated DOC concentrations may also promote bacterial biomass and production and thus potentially increase the concentration of bacterial fatty acids (BAFA) in seston. We analyzed phytoplankton, bacteria and heterotroph biomasses, the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton, and the concentrations and mass fractions of bioseston PUFA, BAFA, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids in ten boreal lakes in eastern Finland, with DOC concentration ranging from 2.8 to 18.7 mg/L. Our results showed that the abundance of PUFA in seston depended on the responses of phytoplankton biomass and community composition to lake browning. Lake browning increased seston PUFA and BAFA concentrations (expressed as µg/L) but not the contents (expressed as µg/mg bioseston C). Although low DOC lakes had a favorable phytoplankton community (in terms of PUFA content), the phytoplankton biomass in these oligotrophic lakes was so low that the concentration of PUFA remained low compared to high DOC lakes. The increasing concentration of PUFA in bioseston along the DOC gradient was mainly due to the increasing biomass of nuisance alga <jats:italic>Gonyostomum semen</jats:italic>. However, <jats:italic>Gonyostomum</jats:italic> may be too large for small‐sized zooplankton to ingest, and thus, the trophic transfer of PUFA may be impaired. The trajectories for lake browning and the basal production of PUFA also may depend on the source of carbon and associated nutrient loading; DOC and nutrient loading from agricultural areas may promote cyanobacteria dominance and decrease PUFA availability in lakes, while DOC runoff from more acidic and nutrient‐poor peatlands may promote <jats:italic>Gonyostomum</jats:italic> dominance and increase seston PUFA concentration.</jats:p>

TI  - The Biogeographic Significance of a Large, Deep Canyon: Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, Southwestern USA
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mountains and uplifted areas occupy more than 10% of the Earth’s surface, and their associated drainages rather commonly develop as constrained, canyon-bound channels. Therefore, large deep canyons (LDCs) are relatively frequently encountered, persistent landforms, occurring either as steeply dipping, V-shaped canyons that emerge from fold, fault-block, volcanic, and dome mountains, or occurring as drainages incised into uplifted plateaus. The latter type include the world’s deepest canyons, including: the 3.35 km-deep Cotahuasi Canyon of the Rio Cotahuasi, a tributary of the Rio Ocona in southwestern Peru; the 2.44 km-deep Hells Canyon of the Snake River in Idaho; the >2.1 km-deep Barranca de Cobre in Chihuahua, Mexico; and the world-renowned 2.48 km-deep Grand Canyon in northern Arizona. LDCs also occur in submarine environments at the mouths of large rivers: the Nile and the Rhone Rivers have large submarine canyons at their mouths created during repeated Pliocene desiccation of the Mediterranean basin; the Indus and Ganges Rivers form lengthy submarine deltaic canyons; the Hudson River in northeastern North America has a substantial submarine canyon; and large canyons form in other tectonically active submarine areas. Whether terrestrial or subaqueous, LDCs support or generate strong ecological gradients, and periodically or perennially provide cascading deliveries of flow, sediments, nutrients, and biota to lower elevations (e.g., Gurnell and Petts 1995; Butman et al. 2006; Canals et al. 2009), processes that may influence the distribution and evolution of life around them.

TI  - Influence of solar radiation on biogeochemical parameters and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the sea surface microlayer of the southern coastal North Sea
PY  - 2018
AB  - We investigated the influence of solar radiation on biogeochemical parameters of the sea surface microlayer (SML), including the spectroscopic composition of FDOM, and biotic and abiotic parameters. We calculated the humification index, biological index, and recently produced material index from the ultraviolet spectra to characterize the dynamic environment of the SML. The humification index ranged from 4 to 14 in the SML and 14 to 22 in underlying water (ULW). An inverse relation for this index as a function of solar radiation was observed, indicating photochemical decomposition of complex molecules present in fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). The biological index (along Leg 2) ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 for the SML and 1.0 to 1.5 for ULW. The index for recently produced material ranged from 0.25 to 0.8 for the SML and 0.5 to 1.0 for ULW. The FDOM enrichment process of the SML was influenced by the photochemical decomposition of highly aromatic-like fluorophores, as indicated by the calculated indices. Fluorescence intensity increased for humic C peaks (>0.5 Raman units) in the North Sea samples and for humic M peaks (>1.0 Raman units) for Jade Bay. Spearman analysis for FDOM enrichment in the SML as a function of PAR (for Leg 2) showed a weak positive correlation (Rho = 0.676, n = 11, p = 0.022). Abundance of small photoautotrophic cells (Rho = 0.782, n = 11, p = 0.045) and of bacteria (Rho = 0.746, n = 11, p = 0.0082) also showed a positive correlation as a function of PAR. Overall, we found positive trends between the intensity of available light and the response of the constituents within the SML, highlighting the role of the surface microlayer as a distinctive habitat characterized by unique photochemical processes.

TI  - Neoglacial lake-ecosystem changes above and below the subarctic Fennoscandian treeline inferred from changes in diatom functional groups
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Algal communities act as sensitive indicators of past and present climate effects on northern lakes, but their responses can vary considerably between ecosystems. Functional trait-based approaches may help us better understand the nature of the diverse biotic responses and their underlying ecosystem changes. We explored patterns in diatom (Bacillariophyceae) growth forms and species composition during the Neoglacial in two shallow lakes typical of subarctic regions, including a dark-colored woodland lake and a clear tundra lake. Sediment carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope biogeochemistry and spectral indices were used to track broadscale changes in lake productivity, the inflow of organic carbon from land, and benthic substratum over the past three millennia. The biogeochemical indices tracked declines in land-lake connectivity as well as lake-water and sediment organic enrichment above and below the subarctic treeline driven by Neoglacial cooling. This broadscale environmental transition was intercepted by periods of elevated primary production associated with transient Neoglacial warm anomalies and, in particular, the twentieth century warming. Although the Neoglacial development of the lakes showed conspicuous similarities, diatom functional and taxonomic responses were not uniform between the lakes pointing to intrinsic differences in the development of benthic habitats and underwater-light regimes. Many of the observed biotic shifts aligned with expectations based on earlier research linking diatom functional traits to changing light and organic levels but the results also point to further research needs, particularly to better differentiate the individual and interactive effects of substratum and light. Despite distinct anthropogenic imprints in the biogeochemical record, the scale of human impact on the lakes’ biota has not, as yet, been profound, but the changes are nonetheless clear when compared to the previous three millennia of natural lake development.</jats:p>

TI  - The complementary power of pH and lake-water organic carbon reconstructions for discerning the influences on surface waters across decadal to millennial time scales
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract. Lysevatten, a lake in southwest Sweden, has experienced both acidification and recent changes in the amount of lake-water organic carbon (TOC), both causing concern across Europe and North America. A range of paleolimnological tools – diatom-inferred pH, inferred lake-water TOC from visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS), multi-element geochemistry and pollen analysis, combined with geochemical modeling were used to reconstruct the lake's chemistry and surroundings back to the most recent deglaciation 12 500 years ago. The results reveal that the recent anthropogenic impacts are similar in magnitude to the long-term variation driven by natural catchment changes and early agricultural land use occurring over centuries and millennia. The combined reconstruction of both lake-water TOC and lithogenic element delivery can explain the major changes in lake-water pH and modeled acid neutralizing capacity during the past 12 500 years. The results raise important questions regarding what precisely comprises "reference" conditions (i.e., free from human impacts) as defined in the European Water Framework Directive.

TI  - Effects of light and nutrients on intraspecific competition among midges from a shallow eutrophic lake
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>1. Intraspecific competition for food may affect the development, survival, and fecundity of organisms. However, environmental variation in abiotic conditions can influence resource quality and/or quantity, thereby modifying the strength of intraspecific competition.</jats:p><jats:p>2. This study focuses on intraspecific competition among <jats:italic>Tanytarsus gracilentus</jats:italic> (Chironomidae: Diptera) larvae. In Lake Mývatn, Iceland, <jats:italic>T. gracilentus</jats:italic> undergoes large population fluctuations, and evidence suggests that these fluctuations are governed by consumer‐resource interactions between the larvae and benthic diatoms. In two experiments, we studied (i) the effects of larval density on individual development and survival, and (ii) how light and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) mediate the strength of intraspecific competition across a density gradient.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Survival declined with increasing larval density in both experiments, although not significantly in the first experiment in which we manipulated only density. In the second experiment, enhancement of either light or phosphorus mitigated the negative effect of larval density on survival. In both experiments, density had a negative effect on individual development. In the first experiment, fewer larvae progressed to the final fourth instar at higher densities. In the second experiment, larvae were smaller in high density treatments, and this effect was most pronounced in the treatments without light or phosphorus supplementation.</jats:p><jats:p>4. These results highlight the potential for environmental factors to influence the strength of density‐dependent competition. Environmental variation that affects resource quantity or quality may influence the overall dynamics of our study organism and other populations whose dynamics are controlled by consumer‐resource relationships.</jats:p>

TI  - Partial coupling and differential regulation of biologically and photochemically labile dissolved organic carbon across boreal aquatic networks
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract. Despite the rapidly increasing volume of research on the biological and photochemical degradation of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in aquatic environments, little is known of the large-scale patterns in biologically and photochemically degradable DOC (BDOC and PDOC, respectively) in continental watersheds, and on the links that exist between these two key properties that greatly influence the flow of carbon from continents to oceans. Here we explored the patterns in the concentrations and proportions of BDOC and PDOC across hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands spanning a large range of system trophic status and terrestrial influence, and compared the drivers of these two reactive pools of DOC at the landscape level. Using standardized incubations of natural waters, we found that the concentrations of BDOC and PDOC covaried across all systems studied but were nevertheless related to different pools of dissolved organic matter (DOM; identified by fluorescence analyses) in ambient waters. Concentrations of nutrients and protein-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM) explained nearly half of the variation in BDOC, whereas PDOC was exclusively predicted by DOM optical properties, consistent with the photochemical degradability of specific FDOM pools that we experimentally determined. The concentrations of colored DOM (CDOM), which we use here as a proxy of terrestrial influence, almost entirely accounted for the observed relationship between FDOM and the concentrations of both BDOC and PDOC. The concentrations of CDOM and of the putative biolabile fluorescence component shifted from complete decoupling in clear-water environments to strong coupling in darker streams and wetlands. This suggests a baseline autochthonous BDOC pool fueled by internal production that is gradually overwhelmed by land-derived BDOC as terrestrial influence increases across landscape gradients. The importance of land as a major source of both biologically and photochemically degradable DOC for continental watersheds resulted in a partial coupling of those carbon pools in natural freshwaters, despite fundamental contrasts in terms of their composition and regulation.

TI  - Declining greenness in Arctic-boreal lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - The highest concentration of the world's lakes are found in Arctic-boreal regions [C. Verpoorter, T. Kutser, D. A. Seekell, L. J. Tranvik, Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 6396-6402 (2014)], and consequently are undergoing the most rapid warming [J. E. Overland et al., Arctic Report Card (2018)]. However, the ecological response of Arctic-boreal lakes to warming remains highly uncertain. Historical trends in lake color from remote sensing observations can provide insights into changing lake ecology, yet have not been examined at the pan-Arctic scale. Here, we analyze time series of 30-m Landsat growing season composites to quantify trends in lake greenness for >4 × 105 waterbodies in boreal and Arctic western North America. We find lake greenness declined overall by 15% from the first to the last decade of analysis within the 6.3 × 106-km2 study region but with significant spatial variability. Greening declines were more likely to be found in areas also undergoing increases in air temperature and precipitation. These findings support the hypothesis that warming has increased connectivity between lakes and the land surface [A. Bring et al., J. Geophys. Res. Biogeosciences 121, 621-649 (2016)], with implications for lake carbon cycling and energy budgets. Our study provides spatially explicit information linking climate to pan-Arctic lake color changes, a finding that will help target future ecological monitoring in remote yet rapidly changing regions.

TI  - Responses of microbial food web to increased allochthonous DOM in an oligotrophic subarctic lake
PY  - 2013
AB  - Climate-induced changes in catchment area vegetation and runoff alter the quality and quantity of carbon that enters lakes, with implications for food webs in recipient water bodies. The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the ratio between heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass and productivity was studied in a subarctic, clear water lake in northern Finland. In a mesocosm experiment, natural DOM from a subarctic bog and a boreal lake was added to the lake water, doubling the initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Optical indices sug- gested that the subarctic DOM addition was more bioavailable, which was in line with the greater increase in bacterial biomass and production observed in this treatment. Both DOM additions increased the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and decreased primary produc- tivity. They also led to lower ratios of primary to bacterial production, autotrophic to mixotrophic algae and pigmented nanoflagellates (PNF) to HNF relative to the control samples, indicating a shift from a primary production-based food web towards one based on bacterial production. A comparable increase in DOM in the natural environment would lead to a considerable decrease in the euphotic layer and loss of areas available for primary production, resulting in a shift towards a heterotrophic production based food web.

TI  - Geographical location and habitat predict variation in prokaryotic community composition of Suberites diversicolor
PY  - 2020
AB  - Marine lakes are unique habitats that house diverse assemblages of benthic and planktonic organisms including endemic species. In this study, we aimed to assess to what extent geographical location (Berau versus Papua) and the degree of marine lake connectivity (relatively open versus closed) to the surrounding marine environment structures the prokaryotic community composition of the sponge species Suberites diversicolor. Sponge specimens were sampled in five marine lakes in Borneo and Papua and one open sea habitat in Taiwan. Prokaryotic communities of S. diversicolor were dominated by members assigned to the Proteobacteria (particularly Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and Cyanobacteria, which together made up from 78 to 87% of sequences in all samples. The dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in most samples, OTUs 1 and 3, were both assigned to the alphaproteobacterial order Rhodospirillales with OTU-1 dominant in the marine lakes of Berau and Papua and OTU-3 in Taiwan. OTU-3 was also largely absent from Papuan samples but present in all Berau samples. Compositionally, S. diversicolor samples clustered according to geographical location with the main axis of variation separating marine lake samples collected in Berau from those collected in Papua and the second axis of variation separating open sea samples collected in Taiwan from all marine lake samples. In addition, our results suggest that the degree of lake connectivity to the open sea also influences prokaryotic composition. Although previous studies have shown that sponge-associated microbial communities tend to be stable across different geographical and environmental gradients, in the present study, both geography and local environmental conditions were significant predictors of variation in prokaryotic community composition of S. diversicolor.

TI  - Carbon limitation of lake productivity.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Phytoplankton productivity in lakes controls the rate of synthesis of organic matter that drives energy flow through the food webs and regulates the transparency and oxygen conditions in the water. Limitation of phytoplankton productivity and biomass by nutrients and light availability is an established paradigm for lake ecosystems, whereas invasion of atmospheric CO2 has been assumed to cover the high demands of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during intense organic productivity. We challenge this paradigm, and show up to a 5-fold stimulation of phytoplankton productivity and biomass in outdoor mesocosms enriched with DIC, compared to mesocosms with lower DIC concentrations. High DIC supported phytoplankton productivity by direct algal uptake of bicarbonate, through the release of CO2 coupled to calcification and by inducing high pH that greatly enhances atmospheric CO2 invasion. Comparisons of 204 natural Danish lakes supported mesocosm experiments showing higher phytoplankton biomass and pH levels in hard water than soft water lakes for the same nutrient and light availabilities. The most productive lakes are nutrient-rich, hard water lakes that attain surface pHs of 10-11 and chemically enhance atmospheric CO2 uptake 10-15-fold. Our results will help understand natural variations of lake productivity along gradients in nutrients, DIC and pH.

TI  - Migrate or stay: terrestrial primary productivity and climate drive anadromy in Arctic char
PY  - 2012
AB  - A shift in the magnitude and timing of animal migrations is one of the most documented ecological effects of climate change. Although migrations are largely driven by spatial variation in resource gradients, few studies connect expected changes in primary production with geographic patterns in migratory behavior. Here, we link lake primary production to the occurrence of sea migrations in the partially anadromous salmonid Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.). We compiled presence/absence records of anadromous char populations spanning productivity and temperature gradients along the Norwegian coast. The probability of anadromy decreased with increasing migration distance, maximum slope of the migration route and lake productivity. There was a significant interaction between lake productivity and migration distance. The negative effect of longer migration distances was more severe in lakes with higher productivity, indicating reduced relative profitability of migration with increased feeding opportunities in freshwater. Lake productivity was mainly driven by terrestrial primary production in the catchment. We predicted future distributions of anadromous char given downscaled temperature and precipitation changes projected by two different emission scenarios and global climate models (GCMs). Projected increases in temperature and precipitation in 2071–2100 increased terrestrial primary production and, compared to the control scenario (1961–1990), decreased the range of anadromous populations. The prevalence of anadromy decreased by 53% in the HadAm3H GCM with the A2 emission scenario, 61% in HadAm3H with the B2 scenario and 22% in ECHAM4 with the B2 scenario. Cross-ecosystem studies (e.g., terrestrial to freshwater) are critical for understanding ecological impacts of climate change. In this case, climate-driven increases in terrestrial primary production are expected to increase primary production in lakes and ultimately reduce the prevalence of anadromy in Arctic char populations.

TI  - The missing pieces for better future predictions in subarctic ecosystems: A Torneträsk case study.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Arctic and subarctic ecosystems are experiencing substantial changes in hydrology, vegetation, permafrost conditions, and carbon cycling, in response to climatic change and other anthropogenic drivers, and these changes are likely to continue over this century. The total magnitude of these changes results from multiple interactions among these drivers. Field measurements can address the overall responses to different changing drivers, but are less capable of quantifying the interactions among them. Currently, a comprehensive assessment of the drivers of ecosystem changes, and the magnitude of their direct and indirect impacts on subarctic ecosystems, is missing. The Tornetrask area, in the Swedish subarctic, has an unrivalled history of environmental observation over 100 years, and is one of the most studied sites in the Arctic. In this study, we summarize and rank the drivers of ecosystem change in the Tornetrask area, and propose research priorities identified, by expert assessment, to improve predictions of ecosystem changes. The research priorities identified include understanding impacts on ecosystems brought on by altered frequency and intensity of winter warming events, evapotranspiration rates, rainfall, duration of snow cover and lake-ice, changed soil moisture, and droughts. This case study can help us understand the ongoing ecosystem changes occurring in the Tornetrask area, and contribute to improve predictions of future ecosystem changes at a larger scale. This understanding will provide the basis for the future mitigation and adaptation plans needed in a changing climate.

TI  - Effects of brownification and warming on algal blooms, metabolism and higher trophic levels in productive shallow lake mesocosms.
PY  - 2019
AB  - An increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters has been reported across the northern temperate region but the effects of this on whole lake ecosystems, often combined with other anthropogenic stressors like nutrient inputs and warming, are poorly known. The effects of these changes on different component of the ecosystem were assessed in an experiment using twenty-four large (3000L) outdoor mesocosms simulating shallow lakes. Two different temperature regimes (ambient and ambient +4 °C) combined with three levels of organic matter (OM, added as filtered peaty water), simulating the DOC increase that is predicted to take place over the next 4 to 21 years were used. Neither temperature nor OM had significant effects on net ecosystem production, respiration or gross primary production. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly affected by warming, however in summer, autumn and winter it was significantly higher in mesocosms receiving intermediate OM levels (July–Feb DOC concentrations 2–6 mg L−1). Summer cyanobacterial blooms were highest in intermediate, and lowest in the highest OM treatments. OM concentration also influenced total macroinvertebrate abundance which was greater in spring and summer in mesocosms with intermediate and high OM. Fish abundance was not significantly affected by OM concentration, but abundance was greater in ambient (55 fish subsample−1) compared to heated mesocosms (17 fish subsample−1) and maximum abundance occurred two weeks later compared to heated mesocosms. The results suggest that changes in OM may have a greater effect on shallow lakes than temperature and that phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria, benefit from intermediate OM concentrations, therefore, nuisance algal blooms might increase in relatively clear shallow eutrophic lakes where DOC concentrations increase.

TI  - SITES AquaNet : An open infrastructure for mesocosm experiments with high frequency sensor monitoring across lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - For aquatic scientists mesocosm experiments are important tools for hypothesis testing as they offer a compromise between experimental control and realism. Here we present a new mesocosm infrastructure—SITES AquaNET—located in five lakes connected to field stations in Sweden that cover a ~760 km latitudinal gradient. SITES AquaNet overcomes major hindrances in aquatic experimental research through: (i) openness to the scientific community, (ii) the potential to implement coordinated experiments across sites and time, and (iii) high-frequency measurements (temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density, turbidity and dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations) with an autonomous sensor system. Moreover, the infrastructure provides operational guidance and sensor expertise from technical staff, and connections to a multi-layered monitoring programme (“SITES Water”) for each lake. This enables ecological observations from whole lake ecosystems to be compared with experimental studies aiming at disentangling major drivers and mechanisms underlying observed changes. Here we describe the technical properties of the infrastructure along with possibilities for experimental manipulations to tackle pressing issues in aquatic ecology and global change science. As a proof of concept, we also present a first mesocosm experiment across all five field sites with a cross-factorial design to evaluate responses of the sensor measurements to press/bottom-up (constant light reduction) and pulse/top-down (temporary fish predation) disturbances. This demonstrates the suitability of the infrastructure and autonomous sensor system to host modularized experiments and exemplifies the power and advantages of the approach to integrate a network of mecsocosm facilities with manageable costs across large geographic areas.

TI  - Algal and aquatic plant carbon concentrating mechanisms in relation to environmental change.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms (also known as inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms; both abbreviated as CCMs) presumably evolved under conditions of low CO2 availability. However, the timing of their origin is unclear since there are no sound estimates from molecular clocks, and even if there were, there are no proxies for the functioning of CCMs. Accordingly, we cannot use previous episodes of high CO2 (e.g. the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum) to indicate how organisms with CCMs responded. Present and predicted environmental change in terms of increased CO2 and temperature are leading to increased CO2 and HCO3− and decreased CO32− and pH in surface seawater, as well as decreasing the depth of the upper mixed layer and increasing the degree of isolation of this layer with respect to nutrient flux from deeper waters. The outcome of these forcing factors is to increase the availability of inorganic carbon, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) to aquatic photolithotrophs and to decrease the supply of the nutrients (combined) nitrogen and phosphorus and of any non-aeolian iron. The influence of these variations on CCM expression has been examined to varying degrees as acclimation by extant organisms. Increased PAR increases CCM expression in terms of CO2 affinity, whilst increased UVB has a range of effects in the organisms examined; little relevant information is available on increased temperature. Decreased combined nitrogen supply generally increases CO2 affinity, decreased iron availability increases CO2 affinity, and decreased phosphorus supply has varying effects on the organisms examined. There are few data sets showing interactions amongst the observed changes, and even less information on genetic (adaptation) changes in response to the forcing factors. In freshwaters, changes in phytoplankton species composition may alter with environmental change with consequences for frequency of species with or without CCMs. The information available permits less predictive power as to the effect of the forcing factors on CCM expression than for their overall effects on growth. CCMs are currently not part of models as to how global environmental change has altered, and is likely to further alter, algal and aquatic plant primary productivity.

TI  - Prey-type-dependent foraging of young-of-the-year fish in turbid and humic environments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Fish, which are generally visual foragers, experiences reduced reaction distance in visually degraded environments, which has consequences for encounter rates with prey. Small prey is detected at shorter distances than larger prey, and piscivores are therefore predicted to be more strongly affected by visual degradation. In experiments, roach (Rutilus rutilus) were fed two plankton prey types and pike (Esox lucius) were fed Daphnia and larval roach, in clear water, algal turbid water and water coloured brown by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Planktivorous foraging in roach was not affected by visual degradation, while pike foraging on both Daphnia and larval roach was. Pike showed increased reaction distance to Daphnia in visually degraded water, while it was severely reduced with roach as prey even if the visual range was not reduced below pike reaction distances in clear water. Pike foraging on Daphnia was not affected, but when foraging on roach, the reduced search efficiency was counteracted by increased attack rates. However, there was no increase in movement and no difference between turbid and DOM treatments. Effects on piscivores will likely become more pronounced at later life stages as prey size and the reliance on long-distance detection increases at the same time as changing climatic conditions may further deteriorate the visual conditions in future.

TI  - Sex-dependent responses of perch to changes in water clarity and temperature
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rising temperatures and decreasing water transparency of lakes have strong wide ranging effects on fish. Fish responses to various changes in the environment are usually species-dependent, but responses may also vary within species. In general, large individuals are considered to be more sensitive to environmental variation due to higher energy demand, than smaller individuals. Similarly, large individuals require more food to maintain bodily functions and are thus more sensitive to resource and food scarcity. These size-specific responses to environmental gradients are also sex-dependent in species that exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). We studied in enclosures with short-term experiments how rising temperatures and decreasing water transparency regulate the feeding rates of female and male European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). To explore experimental results, we calculated perch SSD in nine lakes with varying environmental conditions using previously collected field data. The results of the experiments revealed that the combined effect of water transparency and temperature on the feeding rate of fish is gender-dependent: feeding rate of females decreased more than that of males. The experimental results were also supported by field data that revealed a negative relation between water transparency and the magnitude of SSD in perch. Our results suggest that rising temperatures and decreasing water transparency may potentially decrease fish size in a sex-dependent manner. As female size is one of the main demographic traits determining the reproductive success of a fish population, changing environments may have unexpected and far-reaching consequences on fish population dynamics.

TI  - An ecological and methodological assessment of benthic gross primary production in northern lakes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Benthic gross primary production (GPP) is often the most important part of aquatic food webs in northern lakes, which are gradually warming and receiving increased terrestrial colored dissolved organic carbon loadings due to global change. Yet, measurements of benthic GPP are fairly uncommon, and methods and unit dimensions of benthic GPP are unstandardized and rarely compared. In this study, we measured benthic GPP in 27 headwater lakes from three regions in northern Sweden and analyzed potential constraining drivers of benthic GPP<jats:sub><jats:italic>z</jats:italic></jats:sub> rates at discrete depths and estimates of benthic GPP averages across the whole lake, as well as across the littoral zone. We also compared in situ measurements of benthic GPP averages across the whole lake with modeled values using the “autotrophic structuring model.” We found that benthic GPP<jats:sub><jats:italic>z</jats:italic></jats:sub> rates were best explained by, and positively related to, available light (i.e., a function of depth and water color) and temperature. Benthic GPP averages across the whole lake, on the contrary, were best explained by the relative size of the littoral area, which is a measure that combines lake bathymetry and water color. The comparison between in situ measured and modeled estimates of benthic GPP averages across the whole lake revealed that (1) the autotrophic structuring model underestimates GPP at low values and overestimates GPP at high values compared with measured data, and that (2) measured values were related to temperature, which is not included as a variable in the autotrophic structuring model. Considering future predicted changes impacting northern latitude lakes, our results suggest that increased lake water temperatures can to some extent mitigate the negative impacts of reduced light availability from lake browning on benthic GPP<jats:sub><jats:italic>z</jats:italic></jats:sub> rates. The combined impact of these changes on benthic GPP averages across the whole lake will depend on, and be moderated by, lake bathymetry determining the relative size of the littoral area.</jats:p>

TI  - Carbon and phosphorus regulating bacterial metabolism in oligotrophic boreal lakes
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study focused on how phosphorus and carbon control pelagic bacteria in lakes over a gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC from 6.7 to 29.5 mg C L-1) and phosphorus (P-tot from 5 to 19 mu g L-1). Five oligotrophic lakes in southern Sweden were sampled in late autumn. Phosphate-P and glucose-C alone or in combination (0.01 and 0.3 mg L-1, respectively) was added to 1.0 mu m filtered lake water and incubated in darkness at 20 degrees C. Additions of glucose (C) and phosphorus (P) alone did not lead to changes in the rates of bacterial metabolic processes, whereas bacterial respiration and bacterial production responded positively to C + P enrichment for most of the lakes sampled. Bacterial growth efficiency showed a wide range (2.5-28.7%) and low mean value (12%). These variations were not correlated with the DOC concentration. Our results show that heterotrophic bacterial carbon mineralization in this kind of system during autumn is conditioned by the combined availability of labile carbon and phosphorus, with the assimilated carbon mainly transformed to inorganic carbon in respiration, contributing to CO2 supersaturation in these systems.

TI  - Historical TOC concentration minima during peak sulfur deposition in two Swedish lakes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract. Decadal-scale variations in total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in lake water since AD 1200 in two small lakes in southern Sweden were reconstructed based on visible–near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) of their recent sediment successions. In order to assess the impacts of local land-use changes, regional variations in sulfur, and nitrogen deposition and climate variations on the inferred changes in TOC concentration, the same sediment records were subjected to multi-proxy palaeolimnological analyses. Changes in lake-water pH were inferred from diatom analysis, whereas pollen-based land-use reconstructions (Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm) together with geochemical records provided information on catchment-scale environmental changes, and comparisons were made with available records of climate and population density. Our long-term reconstructions reveal that inferred lake-water TOC concentrations were generally high prior to AD 1900, with additional variability coupled mainly to changes in forest cover and agricultural land-use intensity. The last century showed significant changes, and unusually low TOC concentrations were inferred at AD 1930–1990, followed by a recent increase, largely consistent with monitoring data. Variations in sulfur emissions, with an increase in the early 1900s to a peak around AD 1980 and a subsequent decrease, were identified as an important driver of these dynamics at both sites, while processes related to the introduction of modern forestry and recent increases in precipitation and temperature may have contributed, but the effects differed between the sites. The increase in lake-water TOC concentration from around AD 1980 may therefore reflect a recovery process. Given that the effects of sulfur deposition now subside and that the recovery of lake-water TOC concentrations has reached pre-industrial levels, other forcing mechanisms related to land management and climate change may become the main drivers of TOC concentration changes in boreal lake waters in the future.

TI  - Recent climate-driven ecological changes in tropical montane lakes of Rwenzori Mountains National Park, central Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rwenzori Mountains National Park, which straddles the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, has experienced rapid glacier loss since the beginning of the twentieth century, yet there has been little investigation of aquatic biodiversity change in the park. This study presents a paleolimnological analysis from Lake Mahoma (2990 m asl), which is situated in the bamboo-forest transition zone. Diatom and organic geochemistry data from a 39-cm-long sediment core with a basal age of c. 1715 CE were compared with new analyses of previously published data from Lakes Bujuku (3891 m asl) and Lower Kitandara (3989 m asl), in the alpine zone. Comparisons were made to determine if aquatic ecosystem changes exhibited similar inter-lake patterns over the past ~ 150 years of climate warming and glacial recession, or if only local change was apparent. The diatom flora of Lake Mahoma is acidophilous, dominated by Aulacoseira ikapoensis since at least the mid eighteenth century. In recent decades, the obligate nitrogen-heterotroph Nitzschia palea increased in importance, concurrent with declining δ15Norg values. We suggest that these late twentieth century changes were linked to regional warming and increased thermal stratification of Lake Mahoma. Regional comparisons of the Rwenzori lakes were done using existing organic geochemistry records (total organic carbon, C/N and δ13Corg) and through diatom compositional turnover analyses, and categorisation of species into one of four diatom growth morphology traits, or guilds: tychoplanktonic, high-profile, low-profile and motile. Over the past 150 years, all three lakes showed unidirectional, compositional diatom turnover, indicating that deterministic processes had affected diatom communities. Declining turnover at each site is broadly mirrored by an increase in tychoplanktonic taxa, along with concomitant declines in high-profile diatoms at Lake Mahoma, and low-profile diatoms at Lake Bujuku, and at least for the past 60 years, at Lower Kitandara. The interplay between diatom guilds at all sites is mainly a consequence of competition for available resources. Sediment organic carbon at all sites comes from both autochthonous and allochthonous sources, the relative abundances of which are influenced by the time elapsed since lakes had glaciers in their catchment.

TI  - Depth-specific variation in carbon isotopes demonstrates resource partitioning among the littoral zoobenthos
PY  - 2013
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Benthic animals readily consume benthic algae, phytoplankton and terrestrial organic matter and are themselves a major component of fish diets. However, the effect of variation in resource availability on resource use by littoral macroinvertebrates remains poorly resolved. 2. Using stable isotopes of carbon, we quantified depth-specific resource use by zoobenthic functional feeding groups in five lakes in northern Wisconsin. The littoral zoobenthos was collected from soft sediments at several depths in conjunction with samples of bulk periphyton (top 5 mm of sediment and biofilm) and measurements of benthic algal primary productivity. 3. Periphyton d 13 C was positively correlated with depth-specific benthic algal primary productivity, but grazer d 13 C was consistently higher than that of the periphyton. 4. The d 13 C of infaunal collectors and predators was tightly correlated with, and nearly identical to, bulk periphyton d 13 C (collectors: R 2 , 0.88; slope, 0.97; P < 0.0001; predators: R 2 , 0.78; slope, 0.88; P < 0.0001). Reliance of collectors and predators on benthic algal carbon varied between 43 and 100%, depending on whether grazers or bulk periphyton was used as the benthic algal end-member. 5. Despite the apparent homogeneity of the sediments, benthic grazers and collectors partitioned resources in a consistent way in our study lakes, indicating either selective ingestion or assimilation of different components of the biofilm.

TI  - Is there light after depth? Distribution of periphyton chlorophyll and productivity in lake littoral zones
PY  - 2014
AB  - Periphyton and phytoplankton contribute to the base of lake food webs, and both groups of microalgae are influenced by resources and physical forcing. Spatial variation in light availability interacts with the physical dynamics of the water column to create predictable depth gradients in resources and disturbance that may differentially affect periphyton vs phytoplankton. We characterized the depth distribution of chlorophyll and productivity of periphyton on sediments (epipelon) and phytoplankton in the euphotic zones of 13 oligome- sotrophic lakes that span a large size gradient (0.017-32,600 km 2 ). Epipelic chlorophyll usually increased with depth in the epilimnion. Light was the primary driver of the consistent within-lake patterns in periphyton pro- ductivity across this lake-size gradient. In 5 lakes, epipelic periphyton exhibited a unimodal distribution of produc- tivity with depth in the photic zone, but no evidence of photoinhibition was found for periphyton. Rather, patterns in sediment N and P and observed changes in biofilm structure were consistent with determination of epipelic biomass by disturbance at depths ≤1 m in the smaller lakes and by light limitation at depths >1 m. Further quan- tification of the effects of disturbance on epipelon is needed. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that the perceived high spatial variability in periphyton biomass and productivity is not an impediment to development of robust models of whole-lake primary production that include both phytoplankton and periphyton.

TI  - Browning reduces the availability—but not the transfer—of essential fatty acids in temperate lakes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Atmospheric changes are leading to the browning of northern lakes (i.e. increases in catchment‐derived dissolved organic matter [DOM]), consequently altering phytoplankton biomass and community composition. We hypothesised that lake browning and the concurrent increase in nutrients drive a shift towards greater cyanobacteria biomass. We further hypothesised that, as a consequence of this shift in phytoplankton, the content of ω‐3 (n‐3) essential fatty acids (EFA) in seston would decline, affecting the subsequent transfer of EFA to consumers across the plant–animal interface in pelagic regions of lakes. We tested these hypotheses in the epilimnion of 30 temperate lakes in Ontario (Canada), representing a gradient of lake browning, with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranging from 2 to 10 mg/L and total phosphorus ranging from 6.0 to 48.5 μg/L. In each of these lakes, the concentration and composition of DOM, the biomass of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, and the EFA content of seston, cladocerans, and copepods were measured. An increase in aromatic DOM was associated with increased phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass. Due to the lower content of the EFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n‐3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n‐3) in cyanobacteria, this increase in phytoplankton biomass was associated with a decline in EPA and DHA content in lake seston. However, there was no significant change in EFA content of cladocerans and copepods. This homeostatic (diet‐independent) EFA composition in zooplankton suggested that, as the phytoplankton community shifted towards more cyanobacteria with lower EFA content, the cladocerans and copepods may have met their nutritional requirements by relying on alternative food sources (e.g. heterotrophic ciliates and flagellates) capable of either trophically upgrading phytoplankton‐produced EPA and DHA, or synthesising EPA and DHA de novo. Results from this study indicate that increasing DOC from low (2 mg DOC/L) to moderate levels (15 mg DOC/L) may increase the importance of the microbial pathway in the trophic transfer of EPA and DHA from basal resources to zooplankton. However, this supplementary transfer of EFA through the microbial food web may not sustain high EPA and DHA levels in zooplankton when lake browning starts to limit primary production (>15 mg DOC/L).

TI  - Lake browning generates a spatiotemporal mismatch between dissolved organic carbon and limiting nutrients
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Widespread long‐term increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (i.e., “browning”) have been observed in many lakes, but the ecological consequences are poorly understood. Some studies suggest a unimodal relationship between DOC and primary productivity, with peak productivity at intermediate DOC concentrations. This peak is hypothesized to result from the tradeoff between light absorbing properties of DOC, and increases in limiting nutrients with browning. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether nutrient stoichiometry is constant as lakes brown. Across both regional and national surveys, we found a positive linear relationship between DOC and both total and organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. However, long‐term data from a suite of browning lakes indicates that total nutrients do not increase as DOC increases through time. Our results show that DOC and limiting nutrients are coupled spatially, but not temporally, and that this temporal mismatch challenges previous conceptualizations of the long‐term effects of browning on productivity.</jats:p>

TI  - Content, composition, and transfer of polyunsaturated fatty acids in an Arctic lake food web
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Freshwater fish production depends on the production and use of polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 and n‐6 PUFA) from lower trophic levels. Here, we aimed to identify the main trophic pathways that support PUFA content in different fish species (mean 39.7 mg/g dry weight) used in the subsistence fishery of the Inuit community in Greiner Lake near Cambridge Bay (Nunavut, Canada). We used stable isotope and taxon‐specific PUFA stocks, to show that the lake food web was divided into distinctive pelagic and littoral benthic food webs and that different fish species obtained their PUFA from different sources within those food webs. The most concentrated fish in n‐3 PUFA was Arctic char (<jats:italic>Salvelinus alpinus</jats:italic>) that obtained nutritionally valuable PUFA compounds by feeding on pelagic zooplankton rich in the essential fatty acids EPA and DHA and on littoral prey with lower PUFA content. The pelagic consumer, lake whitefish (<jats:italic>Coregonus clupeaformis</jats:italic>), that fed on mysids and zooplankton was also rich in n‐3 PUFA. The least concentrated in n‐3 PUFA was lake trout (<jats:italic>Salvelinus namaycush</jats:italic>) that obtained PUFA from low n‐3 PUFA sticklebacks (<jats:italic>Pungitius pungitius</jats:italic>) and macroinvertebrates and from n‐3 PUFA‐rich littoral mysids. The benthic PUFA were entirely made of n‐6 fatty acids and no n‐3 PUFA were detected. We further quantified that from the mean daily phytoplankton production of 319 mg C·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>·d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 2.9% was assimilated by zooplankton (9.4 mg C·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>·d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and thereby made available to pelagic fish. The food webs to which fish belonged were supported by PUFA produced in the pelagic and benthic zones but likely complemented by inputs from the watershed. The description of the main PUFA pathways of the Greiner Lake food webs explains for the first time the trophic interactions and underlying mechanisms responsible for the health of the fish community in a high‐Arctic lake.</jats:p>

TI  - Hydrological connectivity drives dissolved organic matter processing in an intermittent stream
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Hydrological conditions are key drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing in intermittent streams. However, there still exist major gaps in knowledge regarding the temporal dynamics of DOM processing during drought periods, as well as the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ). We conducted weekly sampling of surface water and hyporheic pore water during a drying/rewetting cycle and characterized DOM by fluorescence and absorbance properties. Overall, the contribution of allochthonous and humic-like DOM increased during base flow in early summer (pre-drought) and continued increasing throughout the drought period, which covered three phases: contraction, fragmentation and dry. The contribution of autochthonous DOM during this period was restricted to very specific points in time (the transition from contraction to fragmentation phase) and space (the HZ). Hydrological connectivity between the HZ and the surface water was a driver of DOM composition by supplying terrestrial, aromatic DOM to the HZ. The disconnection of the stream from the riparian groundwater enabled us to quantify the DOM retention/release in the HZ. DOM mass balance at the stream-hyporheic interface revealed the occurrence of two time periods with disproportionately high rates for DOM processing (hot moments) during the study period: (1) a short pulse of protein-like, autochthonous DOM net release at the beginning of the disconnection; and (2) a longer time period of increasing net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) retention up to 30% along 25 m of HZ length during fragmentation and dry phase. Remarkably, the net carbon retention was coupled to a decrease of aromatic and high molecular weight compounds, while protein-like, autochthonous DOM was released. This result evidenced that under drought conditions, the HZ becomes a sink for DOM compounds previously assumed to be recalcitrant in aquatic ecosystems and therefore highlights the importance of hydrological drivers on DOM processing.

TI  - Diel cycles of δ 13 C DIC and ecosystem metabolism in ephemeral dryland streams
PY  - 2020
AB  - Streams in hot, arid environments often exist as a series of isolated pools along main channels. During these periods, shallow alluvial through flow may strongly influence key ecological processes within pools. We measured diel changes in δ13C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in two pools of ephemeral, dryland streams. We quantified alluvial water connectivity through stable isotope analysis (δ18O and δ2H) of pool and alluvial water. We also estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates across a wider set of pools in both streams. δ13CDIC values displayed regular diel cycles, where both pools displayed small but similar daily amplitude (0.7–0.9‰) despite contrasting amplitudes of change in DO (0.8 mg L−1 vs. 2.8 mg L−1) and contrasting alluvial water connectivity (connected vs. disconnected). Water temperature was the strongest predictor of both δ13CDIC values and rates of change in δ13CDIC across both pools. Across both streams, all pools were net heterotrophic. GPP (0.35–1.73 g O2 m−2 d−1) and ER (0.49–2.64 g O2 m−2 d−1) rates were linked to aquatic vegetation cover. The disconnect between diurnal amplitudes of δ13C values and DO concentrations thus suggests that ecological drivers of gas exchange became increasingly localised as pools contracted.

TI  - CARBON FROM PERIPHYTON SUPPORTS FISH BIOMASS IN WATERHOLES OF A WET–DRY TROPICAL RIVER
PY  - 2012
AB  - The identification of the dominant sources of carbon supporting consumer biomass in aquatic food webs is often difficult but essential to understanding the limits to aquatic secondary production. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is a powerful tool to estimate the contribution of different sources to consumers, but most food web studies using this approach limit analyses to a few key consumer taxa rather than measuring biomass-weighted contribution of sources to the entire community. Here we combined stable isotope analysis with standardized measurements of abundance and biomass of fishes and invertebrates in seven waterholes of a wet–dry tropical river sampled early and late in the dry season. We showed that periphyton (as opposed to phytoplankton and terrestrial C3 plant detritus) was responsible for most standing fish biomass (range 42%–97%), whereas benthic invertebrates were reliant on a mixture of the three sources (range 26%–100%). Furthermore, larger, older fishes at high trophic levels (catfish Neoarius spp., sleepy cod Oxyeleotris lineaolatus and barramundi Lates calcarifer) were supported almost exclusively by periphyton. Phytoplankton and detritus supported a considerable biomass of benthic and pelagic invertebrates, but only in taxa that occupied low trophic levels (e.g. snails). These measurements provide further evidence that although periphyton is relatively inconspicuous relative to other sources, it contributes disproportionately to metazoan biomass in wet–dry tropical rivers.

TI  - Large difference in carbon emission – burial balances between boreal and arctic lakes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Lakes play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle by burying C in sediments and emitting CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. The strengths and control of these fundamentally different pathways are therefore of interest when assessing the continental C balance and its response to environmental change. In this study, based on new high-resolution estimates in combination with literature data, we show that annual emission:burial ratios are generally ten times higher in boreal compared to subarctic – arctic lakes. These results suggest major differences in lake C cycling between biomes, as lakes in warmer boreal regions emit more and store relatively less C than lakes in colder arctic regions. Such effects are of major importance for understanding climatic feedbacks on the continental C sink – source function at high latitudes. If predictions of global warming and northward expansion of the boreal biome are correct, it is likely that increasing C emissions from high latitude lakes will partly counteract the presumed increasing terrestrial C sink capacity at high latitudes.

TI  - Role of ambient light in structuring north-temperate fish communities: potential effects of increasing dissolved organic carbon concentration with a changing climate
PY  - 2012
AB  - The vertical light environment in freshwater lakes is sensitive to changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and DOC concentrations in most boreal lakes appear to be increasing as the climate changes. Understanding how DOC dynamics in lakes and watersheds are then linked to fish habitat is therefore critical to assessing the effects of climate change on fish communities. This paper reviews the evidence for climate-induced alterations to DOC in north-temperate watersheds and assesses the potential consequences of the resultant decreases in water clarity on fish production and community structure in small boreal lakes (<500 ha). Although DOC increases are forecast for most boreal lakes, complex interactions between local climate, rates of terrestrial organic matter decomposition and runoff, existing water quality, species shifts in forest communities, and changing season lengths can all combine to affect the magnitude of water clarity declines that will occur in individual lakes. Elevated DO...

TI  - Dissolved organic N in shallow tropical lakes and reservoirs: Contribution to total dissolved N and relationships with eutrophication
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) plays important biogeochemical and ecological roles in aquatic systems. However, little is known about its importance in small tropical lakes and reservoirs. We hypothesized that (a) DON is higher in these systems than dissolved inorganic N (DIN), and that (b) relative contributions of DON and DIN to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) pool decrease and increase, respectively, with trophic status. To test these hypotheses, we measured DON and DIN in six lakes and two reservoirs at the Atlantic forest‐Cerrado savanna transition in Southeast Brazil, in the rainy and the dry season. With one exception in each season, all oligo‐ and mesotrophic systems had DON:DIN ratios &gt;1. DON:DIN ratios were negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP). This pattern was due to high DIN, mainly ammonium, in eutrophic and hypertrophic systems. DON:DIN ratios &lt;1 occurred at TP higher than 103 and 104 µg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the rainy and dry season, respectively. We found a general dominance of DON in near‐natural lentic systems at the Atlantic forest‐Cerrado savanna transition, which was more pronounced than that reported for other regions. Human alterations to the TDN pool may affect biological communities and ecosystem functioning of these systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Consistent patterns in diatom assemblages and diversity measures across water‐depth gradients from eight Boreal lakes from north‐western Ontario (Canada)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Until recently, the distribution of diatom species assemblages and their attributes (e.g. species richness and evenness) in relation to water depth have been identified but not quantified, especially across several lakes in a region. Here, we examined diatom assemblages in the surface sediment across a water-depth gradient in eight small, boreal lakes in north-western Ontario, minimally disturbed by human activities. 2. Surface-sediment diatom assemblages were collected within each lake along a gentle slope from near-shore to the centre deep basin of the lake, at a resolution of ∼1 m water depth. Analysis of sedimentary samples provided an integrated view of assemblages that were living in the lake over several years and enabled a high-resolution analysis of many lakes. The study lakes ranged in water chemistry, morphology and size and are located along an east–west transect approximately 250 km long in north-western Ontario (Canada). 3. The majority of diatom species were distributed along a continuum of depth, with those taxa having similar habitat requirements forming distinct, though overlapping, assemblages. Three major zones of diatom assemblages in each lake were consistently identified: (i) a near-shore assemblage of Achnanthes (sensu lato), Nitzschia, Cymbella (sensu lato) and other benthic species; (ii) a mid-depth assemblage of small Fragilaria (sensu lato)/small Aulacoseira and various Navicula taxa; and (iii) a deep-water assemblage of planktonic origin (mainly Discotella spp.). 4. The depth of the transition between assemblage zones varied between the eight lakes. The boundary between the deep-water planktonic zone and the mid-depth benthic zone varied according to water chemistry and was probably related to light attenuation. The boundary was deeper in lakes with the lower dissolved organic carbon and total phosphorus (TP) (i.e. less light attenuation) and vice versa. 5. Generally, species richness, species evenness and turnover rate of species as a function of depth were significantly lower in the planktonic assemblage zone in comparison with the two zones nearer the shore. Reproducibility of species and assemblage distributions across the depth gradient of the lakes illustrated that, despite potential for sediment transport, detailed ecological characterisation of diatom species can be gleaned from sedimentary data. Such data are often lacking, particularly for near-shore benthic species.

TI  - When soft waters becomes softer; drivers of critically low levels of Ca in Norwegian lakes
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this study, we analyzed long-term trends in calcium (Ca) concentrations for 70 Norwegian lakes spanning a broad geographical range and for a wide range of ambient drivers. A striking decline in Ca concentrations was observed during the past 30 yr. The trend was most pronounced in southern, previously acidified localities, while there were weaker and less consistent patterns for central and northern regions. For previously acidified areas, this observed decline in Ca is likely related to base cation depletion or reduced Ca mobilization as a consequence of reduced H2SO4-deposition. However, lower chloride concentrations, increased runoff and forest density (represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) also exerted strong negative impacts on Ca-concentrations. For lakes with a significant negative trend (n = 34), the average decline was −11.05% per decade, corresponding to −0.023 mg Ca L−1 yr−1. This trend may pull levels of Ca in these already Ca-deficient poor lakes toward, or below, critically low levels for a range of organisms. A somewhat paradoxical effect of the successful battle against anthropogenic acidification is thus that it may impose an increased Ca-deficiency of freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Coupling dissolved organic carbon, CO2 and productivity in boreal lakes
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary Lakes worldwide are in rapid change because of direct or indirect climate impacts. In boreal areas, the increased concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are profoundly affecting light climate and productivity in multiple ways. Photochemical and microbial mineralisation of DOM are major sources of CO2 in these lakes. It has been suggested that this CO2 could potentially promote primary production and offset negative impacts of increased light attenuation. A synoptic survey of 76 Scandinavian lakes along gradients of DOM and total phosphorus (TP) revealed a major negative impact of DOM on primary production and algal biomass primarily related to light attenuation, whilst a strong positive impact of TP. The negative impact of DOM on lake productivity is thus partly offset by DOM-associated P. Concentrations of CO2 did not relate significantly to either production, biomass, or seston stoichiometry, and thus whilst elevated CO2 may promote primary production in more productive lakes, it does not in these CO2-supersaturated boreal lakes. Zooplankton biomass correlated strongly with TP and total algal biomass, less so with primary production, and was negatively related to DOM, likely reflecting the autotroph responses to DOM.

TI  - Acidity controls on dissolved organic carbon mobility in organic soils
PY  - 2012
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters have increased across much of Europe and North America, with implications for the terrestrial carbon balance, aquatic ecosystem functioning, water treatment costs and human health. Over the past decade, many hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, from changing climate and land management to eutrophication and acid deposition. Resolution of this debate has been hindered by a reliance on correlative analyses of time series data, and a lack of robust experimental testing of proposed mechanisms. In a 4 year, four-site replicated field experiment involving both acidifying and deacidifying treatments, we tested the hypothesis that DOC leaching was previously suppressed by high levels of soil acidity in peat and organo-mineral soils, and therefore that observed DOC increases a consequence of decreasing soil acidity. We observed a consistent, positive relationship between DOC and acidity change at all sites. Responses were described by similar hyperbolic relationships between standardized changes in DOC and hydrogen ion concentrations at all sites, suggesting potentially general applicability. These relationships explained a substantial proportion of observed changes in peak DOC concentrations in nearby monitoring streams, and application to a UK-wide upland soil pH dataset suggests that recovery from acidification alone could have led to soil solution DOC increases in the range 46–126% by habitat type since 1978. Our findings raise the possibility that changing soil acidity may have wider impacts on ecosystem carbon balances. Decreasing sulphur deposition may be accelerating terrestrial carbon loss, and returning surface waters to a natural, high-DOC condition.

TI  - Impacts of added dissolved organic carbon on boreal freshwater pelagic metabolism and food webs in mesocosm experiments.
PY  - 2010
AB  - We studied the response of pelagic community metabolism, bacterial community structure and the origin of crustacean zooplankton carbon following additions of two different sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), natural humic water and cane sugar, in two mesocosm experiments lasting 15-18 days. Experimental water with the natural plankton community originated from two boreal lakes in southern Finland having similar total organic carbon (ca. 11 mg L -1 ) and total phosphorus (ca. 13 μg L -1 ) content, but differing in total nitrogen content (ca. 1450 and 440 mg L -1 ). The experiments demonstrated limitation of bacterial activity mainly by biodegradable DOC in the high nitrogen lake water, and by nitrogen in the low nitrogen lake water, which was also reflected in total pelagic energy metabolism and zooplankton productivity. DOC additions caused changes in the bacterial community structure, shown by length heterogeneity analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene (LH-PCR). Cane sugar, differing in stable carbon isotope value (δ 13 C ca.-11‰) from that of humic matter of boreal terrestrial vegetation (δ 13 C ca.-28‰), proved to be a good tracer of DOC via bacteria to metazooplankton, especially in the nitrogen-limited conditions. Utilization of detrital particulate terrestrial organic matter by zooplankton was also evident, but it appeared to be a poor quality food. Our results show that an increased loading of allochthonous DOC to boreal lakes as predicted under future climate scenarios will not necessarily stimulate bacterial production and hence carbon transfer up the food web. Whether this happens will be strongly dependent on the stoichiometry (C: N:P ratios) of the available resources.

TI  - Soil frost enhances stream dissolved organic carbon concentrations during episodic spring snow melt from boreal mires
PY  - 2012
AB  - Changes in winter time conditions at high-latitude ecosystems could severely affect the carbon exchange processes. Using a 15 year stream record combined with winter field measurements and laboratory experiment, we studied the regulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in stream water draining boreal mire during snow melt. The most unanticipated finding was that cold soils with deep soil frost resulted in increased snow melt DOC concentrations in the stream runoff. Wintertime field measurements of DOC concentrations below the mire soil frost showed that this phenomenon could be explained by freeze-out of DOC giving higher levels of DOC in the soil water below the ice as the soil frost developed downwards in the mire. Experimental freezing of water with a certain DOC concentration in the laboratory further corroborated the freeze-out of DOC. In this experiment, as much as 96% of the DOC was excluded from the ice, whereas the freeze-out in the mire was less effective (60%). The difference between the proportion of DOC retained in pure water relative to the proportion retained in peat water during freezing is probably due to trapped DOC in the solid peat soil matrix. A simple mass-balance model showed that to explain the higher stream DOC concentrations during a winter with deep soil frost, approximately 0.5% of the mire area needed to be hydrologically connected to the stream discharge. In the stream records, we also found that the DOC concentrations during snow melt episodic runoff were negatively related to increasing intensity of the snow melt episodes (dilution by low DOC snow melt water) and higher previous export of DOC.

PY  - 2013
AB  - Albinism in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka) may be a significant biomarker that can be used to obtain information about behaviors and growth of this species. The goal of this study was to compare the behaviors and growth rate between albino and normal A. japonicus. Total light intensity and specific growth rate were used as statistical indices. Diverse light intensities were tested in the laboratory and in the field to identify ecological characteristics of albino A. japonicus. Experimental results revealed that: (1) both albino and normal specimens had negative phototaxis; (2) normal A. japonicus were more responsive to intense light than albino species, and the latter could withstand longer periods of exposure to intense light; (3) normal A. japonicus grew faster than albino specimens; and (4) both normal and albino A. japonicus grew faster in natural light than in the other light intensities tested.

TI  - Immediate effect of sewerage improvement on the phytoplankton and physicochemical conditions in the Urdaibai estuary (southeastern Bay of Biscay)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Anthropic nutrient enrichment has become a major environmental issue in estuaries around the world, being the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) one of the main causes. Phytoplankton is, together with nutrients, a useful indicator for the ecological status assessment of estuaries due to its basal position in the food chain. The present study aims to evaluate the immediate effect of the cessation of the wastewater discharges on the environmental conditions and phytoplankton community along the eutrophicated Urdaibai estuary (southeastern Bay of Biscay). Thus, a short-term comparison of the physicochemical conditions and the phytoplankton abundance and community composition (by pigment analysis and microscopy) was carried out before and after the sewerage works. Results confirmed that the cessation of wastewater discharges had an immediate effect in the estuary, mainly noticed in the inner part. The abrupt decrease of ammonium (from 72.3 to 18.2μmol/L) and phosphate (from 3.5 to 2μmol/L) concentrations led to the improvement of the water status, reaching values lower than the “good” status threshold along the whole estuary. The phytoplankton community composition also showed and immediate reaction in the surroundings of the WWTP, with the chlorophyll b becoming the dominant secondary pigment in the area after the diversion due to the immediate and rapid increase of Eutreptiella sp. However, since the sampling-period of this study did not exceed a month after the cessation, a longer study-period is necessary, including interannual studies, to test the real effect of the sanitation works in the Urdaibai estuary.

TI  - Recognizing cross-ecosystem responses to changing temperatures: soil warming impacts pelagic food webs
PY  - 2015
AB  - The energy and materials that move across ecosystem boundaries influence food web structure and key ecosystem functions. Despite the acknowledged importance of such ecological subsidies, surprisingly little information is available regarding the role of environmental temperature in influencing subsidy quality and the response of the recipient ecosystem. We evaluated the impacts of temperature-mediated changes in leaves from deciduous trees, an important subsidy from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems, on both the producer-based and detritivore-based components of a pelagic pond food web in a field mesocosm experiment. We hypothesized that variation in leaf chemistry driven by increased soil temperature would alter both the quality of leaf subsidies and the pond response. We collected red maple Acer rubrum leaves from heated and ambient temperature plots from the long-term soil warming experiment at the Harvard Experimental Forest and added them to 167-l field mesocosms containing established plankton communities, creating ‘no leaf’, ‘ambient leaf’ and ‘heated leaf’ treatments during autumn 2012. We then monitored physical, chemical, and biological responses to treatments until the mesocosms froze six weeks later. Experimental soil warming altered the chemical composition of deciduous leaves, the physical and chemical environment of the aquatic ecosystems to which leaves were added, and the pelagic pond food webs as measured by community composition. Compared to leaves from ambient-temperature soils, leaves from warmed soils initially resulted in lower water column phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon, reducing bacterial densities. However, the diminished carbon and phosphorus resulting from soil warming also increased light availability that ultimately stimulated cladoceran zooplankton relative to ambient-temperature leaves. Our results suggest that changes in temperature can alter ecological subsidies in unanticipated ways, and suggest that accurately predicting the potential consequences of climate change will require conducting research across ecosystem boundaries.

TI  - Integrating Economic and Ecological Benchmarking for a Sustainable Development of Hydropower
PY  - 2016
AB  - Hydropower reservoirs play an increasingly important role for the global electricity supply. Reservoirs are anthropogenically-dominated ecosystems because hydropower operations induce artificial water level fluctuations (WLF) that exceed natural fluctuations in frequency and amplitude. These WLF have detrimental ecological effects, which can be quantified as losses to ecosystem primary production due to lake bottoms that fall dry. To allow for a sustainable development of hydropower, these “ecological costs” of WLF need to be weighed against the “economic benefits” of hydropower that can balance and store intermittent renewable energy. We designed an economic hydropower operation model to derive WLF in large and small reservoirs for three different future energy market scenarios and quantified the according losses in ecosystem primary production in semi-natural outdoor experiments. Our results show that variations in market conditions affect WLF differently in small and large hydropower reservoirs and that increasing price volatility magnified WLF and reduced primary production. Our model allows an assessment of the trade-off between the objectives of preserving environmental resources and economic development, which lies at the core of emerging sustainability issues.

TI  - Changes in dissolved organic matter quality in a peatland and forest headwater stream as a function of seasonality and hydrologic conditions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract. Peatlands and peaty riparian zones are major sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but are poorly understood in terms of export dynamics and controls thereof. Thereby quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in stream water draining a bog and a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA254), apparent molecular size (SR) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. Stream water at the forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in DOM concentrations and quality compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog, where DOM was less susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions. During snowmelt and spring events, near-surface protein-like DOM pools were exported. A microbial DOM fraction originating from groundwater and deep peat layers was increasing during drought, while a strongly microbially altered DOM fraction was also exported by discharge events with dry preconditions at the forested site. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site under these preconditions. Our study demonstrated that DOM export dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but monitoring studies have to consider that DOM quality depends on hydrologic preconditions and season. Moreover, the forested peaty riparian zone generated the most variability in headwater DOM quantity and quality, as could be tracked by the used spectrofluorometric indices.

TI  - Ecology and extent of freshwater browning - What we know and what should be studied next in the context of global change.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Water browning or brownification refers to increasing water color, often related to increasing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and carbon (DOC) content in freshwaters. Browning has been recognized as a significant physicochemical phenomenon altering boreal lakes, but our understanding of its ecological consequences in different freshwater habitats and regions is limited. Here, we review the consequences of browning on different freshwater habitats, food webs and aquatic-terrestrial habitat coupling. We examine global trends of browning and DOM/DOC, and the use of remote sensing as a tool to investigate browning from local to global scales. Studies have focused on lakes and rivers while seldom addressing effects at the catchment scale. Other freshwater habitats such as small and temporary waterbodies have been overlooked, making the study of the entire network of the catchment incomplete. While past research investigated the response of primary producers, aquatic invertebrates and fishes, the effects of browning on macrophytes, invasive species, and food webs have been understudied. Research has focused on freshwater habitats without considering the fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. We highlight the importance of understanding how the changes in one habitat may cascade to another. Browning is a broader phenomenon than the heretofore concentration on the boreal region. Overall, we propose that future studies improve the ecological understanding of browning through the following research actions: 1) increasing our knowledge of ecological processes of browning in other wetland types than lakes and rivers, 2) assessing the impact of browning on aquatic food webs at multiple scales, 3) examining the effects of browning on aquatic-terrestrial habitat coupling, 4) expanding our knowledge of browning from the local to global scale, and 5) using remote sensing to examine browning and its ecological consequences.

TI  - Trade-offs and Synergies in the Structural and Functional Characteristics of Leaves Photosynthesizing in Aquatic Environments
PY  - 2018
AB  - Aquatic plants, comprising different divisions of embryophytes, derive from terrestrial ancestors. They have evolved to live in water, both fresh and salty, an environment that presents unique challenges and opportunities for photosynthesis and growth. These include, compared to air, a low water stress, a greater density, and attenuation of light, and a more variable supply of inorganic carbon, both in concentration and chemical species, but overall a lower carbon availability, and the opportunity to take up nutrients from the water. The leaves of many aquatic plants are linear, dissected, whorled, or cylindrical with a large volume of air spaces. They tend to have a high specific leaf area, thin cuticles, and usually lack functional stomata. Exploiting the availability of chemicals in their environment, freshwater macrophytes may incorporate silica in their cell wall, while seagrasses contain sulphated polysaccharides, similar to those of marine macroalgae; both groups have low lignin content. This altered cell wall composition produces plants that are more flexible and therefore more resistant to hydraulic forces (mechanical stress arising from water movement). Aquatic plants may have enhanced light harvesting complexes conferring shade adaptation, but also have mechanisms to cope with high light. Aquatic plants have evolved numerous strategies to overcome potential carbon-limitation in water. These include growing in micro-environments where CO2 is high, producing leaves and roots that exploit CO2 from the air or sediment and operating concentrating mechanisms that increase CO2 (CCM) around the primary carboxylating enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase. These comprise C4 metabolism, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the ability to exploit the often high concentrations of HCO3−, and ~50% of freshwater macrophytes and ~85% of seagrasses have one or more CCM. Many of these adaptations involve trade-offs between conflicting constraints and opportunities while others represent ‘synergies’ that help to maximize the productivity of this important group of plants.

TI  - EVALUATING SHALLOW‐WATER BATHYMETRY FROM THROUGH‐WATER TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING UNDER A RANGE OF HYDRAULIC AND PHYSICAL WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS
PY  - 2013
AB  - The fine-scale structure of the water–sediment boundary in fluvial environments is dynamic and complex, influencing near-bed flows, sediment transport and instream ecology. However, accurate high-resolution surveying of marginally or partially inundated areas of river channels is problematic. Previous work has shown that terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) through relatively shallow-water columns using standard green-wavelength equipment introduces errors of <5 mm in a static, clear water column. This paper presents seven laboratory and field tests of through-water TLS under variable flow velocities, depths, suspended sediment concentrations, water colour levels and scan ranges. Flow velocity decreased point accuracy only for supercritical flows, whereas point density decreased as a function of both water depth and suspended sediment concentration. A similar point return threshold was observed for water colour variations with no grains in suspension. Conversely, point precision and accuracy were a function of suspended sediment concentration alone (a threshold of 0.11 g L−1 was observed). Field tests showed larger errors (<10 mm) and lower point precisions. A clear-water depth-penetration limit of 0.68 m was identified. Fluvial bathymetry acquired from through-water TLS is presented for a gravel/boulder bed reach. Despite observed limits, these experiments demonstrate that our approach provides centimetre-resolution bathymetry and sub-aerial survey in an integrated dataset without the need for the following: (i) additional financial resources; (ii) concurrent depth measurements; or (iii) extra field effort for bathymetry acquisition, thereby enabling regular surveys to characterize the fine-scale structure of channel beds and to constrain the geomorphic effect of individual flood events.

TI  - Browning of boreal lakes: Do public perceptions and governance align with the biological foundations?
PY  - 2023
AB  - Browning of surface waters, also known as brownification, is a process of decreasing water transparency, particularly in boreal lakes surrounded by intensively managed forests and wetlands. In this paper, we review the ecological consequences and ecosystem-based management (EBM) of browning through a systematic review approach and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to formulating new governance of this complex phenomenon. To understand the effects of browning on the recreational value of freshwaters, we present primary survey data on public perceptions of recreational fishing tourists on water quality in Finland. We identify a need to develop EBM beyond the EU's Water Framework Directive (WFD) to fully account for the extensive implications of browning. We also highlight the need for a better understanding of the within-lake microbial processes to estimate the browning-associated changes in the greenhouse gas balance of lakes. Tourist perceptions of the quality of waterbodies in Finland were largely in agreement with the general proportion of waterbodies classified in a good or excellent ecological status class, but these perceptions may be detached from biological quality assessment criteria. Consequently, we suggest that the EBM of inland waters should improve the utilization of information on not only biogeochemical processes but also users' perspectives on aquatic ecosystems beyond the EU WFD.

TI  - The Eye Size of the Bluefin Killifish (Lucania goodei) Varies from Springs to Swamps
PY  - 2020
AB  - Variation in lighting environments creates different demands of visual systems for the successful detection and interpretation of visual signals. Eye size is a critical property of the visual system as it has strong effects on visual acuity and visual sensitivity. While many comparative studies have examined eye size across fishes that live in disparate lighting environments (i.e., caves versus surface habitats, mesopelagic versus pelagic depths, turbid versus clear water, diurnal versus nocturnal), fewer have investigated differences in eye size as a function of water clarity at the among-population level. Here, we compared relative eye size (eye size residuals on standard length) among wild-caught Bluefin Killifish (Lucania goodei) from tannin-stained swamps and clear springs across four drainages in Florida. We also performed a laboratory rearing experiment where we reared animals in clear and tea-stained water, which mimic spring and swamp conditions, to determine whether phenotypic plasticity as a function of lighting conditions influences relative eye size. Field caught animals varied greatly in relative eye size among populations, but there was no clear relationship with lighting environment. Fish from the two southern drainages (Everglades, Withlacootchee) had greater relative eye size than two northern drainages (Suwannee, North Florida). However, the results of our laboratory rearing experiment indicated that fish reared in clear water had slightly larger eyes compared to those in tea-stained water. While there are small effects of lighting environment on eye size, there are additional unknown genetic and environmental/ecological factors that influence adult eye size.

TI  - Potential ecological impacts of floating photovoltaics on lake biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
PY  - 2023
AB  - The need to mitigate the effects of climate change is accelerating the development of novel technologies such as floating photovoltaics (FPV). Despite FPV being identified as an emerging issue of concern for biodiversity conservation, it is fast spreading globally and our understanding of their potential ecological impacts is limited. We present an overview of the current knowledge and provide an ecological perspective on FPV potential impacts on lake biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. To date, published works have highlighted reductions in light arrival, wind speed and water temperature with increased FPV cover but the subsequent cascading effects on biological and ecological processes remain unknown. We suggest that modifications in light and water temperature can alter individual regulatory processes affecting, primary production and energy transfer within lake food webs. Additionally, FPV can modify the thermal functioning and oxygenation of the water column while providing artificial habitats for organisms. These modifications can affect individual behavior and life-story but also alter the composition of plant and animal communities, trophic interactions and greenhouse gas balances. We suggest that FPV can also modify socioecological activities related to lake use (e.g., angling, leisure) and pressures at the meta-ecosystem level. Overall, we argue that FPV impacts will be highly context-dependent, varying across ranges of environmental conditions and industrial characteristics (e.g., FPV cover and location). Given the ecological and socio-economic implications of FPV, empirical quantifications based on robust designs are urgently needed and we provide here a unique guideline to help developing research programs to monitor these potential impacts.

TI  - Impacts of forestry planting on primary production in upland lakes from north-west Ireland
PY  - 2016
AB  - Planted forests are increasing in many upland regions worldwide, but knowledge about their potential effects on algal communities of catchment lakes is relatively unknown. Here, the effects of afforestation were investigated using palaeolimnology at six upland lake sites in the north-west of Ireland subject to different extents of forest plantation cover (4–64% of catchment area). 210Pb-dated sediment cores were analysed for carotenoid pigments from algae, stable isotopes of bulk carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N), and C/N ratios. In lakes with >50% of their catchment area covered by plantations, there were two- to sixfold increases in pigments from cryptophytes (alloxanthin) and significant but lower increases (39–116%) in those from colonial cyanobacteria (canthaxanthin), but no response from biomarkers of total algal abundance (β-carotene). In contrast, lakes in catchments with <20% afforestation exhibited no consistent response to forestry practices, although all lakes exhibited fluctuations in pigments and geochemical variables due to peat cutting and upland grazing prior to forest plantation. Taken together, patterns suggest that increases in cyanobacteria and cryptophyte abundance reflect a combination of mineral and nutrient enrichment associated with forest fertilization and organic matter influx which may have facilitated growth of mixotrophic taxa. This study demonstrates that planted forests can alter the abundance and community structure of algae in upland humic lakes of Ireland and Northern Ireland, despite long histories of prior catchment disturbance.

TI  - Cross‐scale interactions dictate regional lake carbon flux and productivity response to future climate
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Lakes support globally important food webs through algal productivity and contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. However, predictions of how broad‐scale lake carbon flux and productivity may respond to future climate are extremely limited. Here, we used an integrated modeling framework to project changes in lake‐specific and regional primary productivity and carbon fluxes under 21st century climate for thousands of lakes. We observed high uncertainty in whether lakes collectively were to increase or decrease lake CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions and carbon burial in our modeled region owing to divergence in projected regional water balance among climate models. Variation in projected air temperature influenced projected changes in lake primary productivity (but not CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions or carbon burial) as warmer air temperatures decreased productivity through reduced lake water volume. Cross‐scale interactions between regional drivers and local characteristics dictated the magnitude and direction of lake‐specific carbon flux and productivity responses to future climate.</jats:p>

TI  - Forestry Impact on Water Quality: a Landscape Perspective on Dissolved Organic Carbon
PY  - 2013
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a fundamental variable defining boreal stream ecosystems. In this thesis the impact of forestry practices that are commonly performed in the boreal regions of Scandinavia for stream water quality were evaluated. The thesis is based on combining the use of primary data from the Balsjo paired catchment experiment in northern Sweden with various modeling approaches. Final-felling strongly increased DOC concentrations in boreal first-order streams during the first four years after harvest. Median concentrations increased by 3.0 mg/L after clear-cutting and 6.2 mg/L after site preparation with concentrations being 5-24 mg/L higher in the clear-cut than in the reference catchment during summer storms. Clear-cutting also increased the riverine carbon (C) export significantly from 95 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ to 183 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and to 280 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ during pre-treatment, clear-cut and site-preparation periods, respectively. This export represents an important part of the C-balance of a forest in the region. Hydrological effects of clear-cutting included increased snow accumulation by 29 mm (27%) and a modified spring snowmelt. However, the largest effect on the water balance (~189 mm = 31%) was found during summer, when stream runoff was increased due to reduction in evapotranspiration. The drivers of the increased DOC concentrations were identified as changing flow-pathways in riparian soils activating more surficial, DOC rich soil layers, as well as increased soil temperatures that enhanced the DOC availability in riparian soils and therefore increased DOC mobilization from clear-cuts during the summer. In a final step, the impact of these increased, clear-cut induced DOC inputs into a larger scale boreal stream network were investigated by using a mixing model approach. DOC inputs were transferred to downstream sites, which resulted in increases in DOC concentrations at these locations. Further, the modeling approach showed that increases in DOC concentrations can be statistically detected, if the total area harvested within the stream network exceeds threshold values of 11% (p>0.05) and 23-25% (p<0.001) of the catchment area. Thus, this thesis suggests that threshold values for the maximum percentage of harvested area within a river basin should be implemented into forest planning for boreal catchments that are sensitive to changes in DOC concentrations.

TI  - Do submerged macrophyte species influence crustacean zooplankton functional group richness and their resource use efficiency in the low-light environment?
PY  - 2023
AB  - During the high grazing of epiphytic zooplankton in submerged macrophyte beds, the changes in crustacean zooplankton functional groups are crucial for stabilizing a clear water state in shallow lakes. However, submerged macrophytes often experience low-light stress due to many ecological processes. It is unclear whether submerged macrophytes alter the zooplankton functional group and their resource use efficiency in the low-light environment. We conducted two mesocosm experiments involving the treatments of low-light and submerged macrophyte species (<i>Vallisneria natans</i> and <i>Potamogeton maackianus</i>). The results show that abiotic factors (e.g., light) were the most important variables in explaining the change in the zooplankton community. Specifically, zooplankton functional group (i.e., pelagic species, plant-associated species, and substrate scrapers) richness and zooplankton species diversity decreased with the decreasing light intensity, especially for low substrate scraper abundance. In addition, structural equation models showed that low-light stress reduced zooplankton resource use efficiency by reducing zooplankton functional group richness and species diversity. Compared to species diversity, zooplankton functional group richness had a greater influence on their resource use efficiency (Zp/Chl-<i>a</i>) in the low-light environment. Our results suggest that the low-light stress reduced zooplankton resource use efficiency by changing their functional group richness. Moreover, the abundance of substrate scrapers shaken from <i>V. natans</i> was higher than that from <i>P. maackianus</i>. Therefore, submerged macrophyte species influence crustacean zooplankton functional group richness and their resource use efficiency in the low-light environment. Selecting appropriate aquatic plant species to assure the high diversity of zooplankton should be considered when conducting lake restoration using submerged macrophytes.

TI  - Habitat, not resource availability, limits consumer production in lake ecosystems
PY  - 2015
AB  - Food web productivity in lakes can be limited by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which reduces fish production by limiting the abundance of their zoobenthic prey. We demonstrate that in a set of 10 small, north temperate lakes spanning a wide DOC gradient, these negative effects of high DOC concentrations on zoobenthos production are driven primarily by availability of warm, well-oxygenated habitat, rather than by light limitation of benthic primary production as previously proposed. There was no significant effect of benthic primary production on zoobenthos production after controlling for oxygen, even though stable isotope analysis indicated that zoobenthos do use this resource. Mean whole-lake zoobenthos production was lower in high-DOC lakes with reduced availability of oxygenated habitat, as was fish biomass. These insights improve understanding of lake food webs and inform management in the face of spatial variability and ongoing temporal change in lake DOC concentrations.

TI  - Nitrogen limitation of the phytobenthos in Alpine lakes: results from nutrient-diffusing substrata
PY  - 2014
AB  - 1. In the Alps, as in other mountainous regions across the world, nitrogen (N) enrichment of ecosystems via atmospheric deposition is a major environmental concern. Nitrogen enrichment can cause acidification in poorly buffered lakes and streams, but here we assessed the less well‐known effects of eutrophication on the phytobenthos of lakes and its consequences for grazing. 2. To simulate the effects of N deposition, we conducted experimental nutrient additions (N and N+P) in two lakes in the French Alps, in summer 2012. In each lake, we deployed nutrient‐diffusing substrata for 22 days. The substrata were placed within cages that either allowed or prevented access by macrograzers. We tested the hypotheses that N enrichment: (i) increases phytobenthic biomass, (ii) alters phytobenthic taxonomic composition and (iii) reduces benthic grazing. 3. Supporting the first hypothesis, at the end of the experiments N‐enriched substrata had a greater phytobenthic biomass than unenriched substrata, indicating N limitation. Supporting the second hypothesis, the taxonomic composition of the phytobenthos differed between N‐enriched and control substrata. Green algae, including filamentous forms, were favoured by N enrichment to a greater extent than diatoms and cyanobacteria. By contrast, the third hypothesis was not supported. Grazing had the same effect on the biomass of the phytobenthos regardless of nutrient treatment. 4. Our results highlight the sensitivity of Alpine lakes to deposition of atmospheric N. Its ecological effects are not limited to acidification, but also include increased biomass (eutrophication) and altered taxonomic composition of the phytobenthos. Because filamentous green algae favoured by N enrichment are usually unpalatable to macrograzers, inputs of atmospheric N could reduce the efficiency of transfer of energy from the phytobenthos up through the food web.

TI  - Impacts of freshwater aquaculture on fish communities: A whole‐ecosystem experimental approach
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aquaculture is a growing global industry; freshwater aquaculture has significant potential for expansion in Canada, but growth of the freshwater sector has been slow due to concerns over potential environmental impacts and a lack of information on potential impacts to native fish communities. To provide guidelines and target variables for evaluating aquaculture impacts on freshwater fish communities, we operated an experimental aquaculture farm as a whole‐lake experiment where 10,000 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were raised annually from 2003 to 2007. Impacts were assessed using up to 8 years of pre‐impact and 8–10 years of post‐impact data. Prey fish abundance increased dramatically during aquaculture but declined sharply following the experiment. High abundance of littoral minnows in autumn was not observed during spring and, combined with size distribution data, suggests high overwinter mortality of adult minnows. White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) abundance and body condition declined during and after aquaculture, with evidence of overwinter juvenile recruitment failure in the last 2 years of operation, although size‐at‐age increased. The adult abundance of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) doubled during aquaculture, due to a combination of (a) increased growth rates of young trout and (b) earlier age and larger sizes at maturation. Within 2 years following aquaculture, lake trout abundance declined by nearly 50% to background levels, suggesting a large increase in lake trout mortality once operations ceased. These changes were not observed in nearby reference lakes. While aquaculture appeared to benefit some species (slimy sculpin [Cottus cognatus], minnows, lake trout), prolonged declines in white sucker abundance and condition and continued depression of Mysis densities and optimal oxythermal habitat availability nearly a decade following operations suggest potentially long‐term impacts at this magnitude. Importantly, this experiment highlights important indicator species and life history traits for monitoring of freshwater aquaculture impacts on native fish communities.

TI  - A test of the subsidy–stability hypothesis: the effects of terrestrial carbon in aquatic ecosystems
PY  - 2015
AB  - Global change is altering the movement of materials across landscapes in ways that likely have major consequences for the functioning and stability of ecosystems. For example, the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems is increasing globally. This browning phenomenon is expected to alter the stability of recipient aquatic ecosystems, but theory provides contrasting predictions about the form and direction of this response. We created a gradient in terrestrial DOC supply by adding humic substances on weekly basis to 10 experimental ponds (10 6 L each) over a growing season. The manipulation of terrestrial DOC supply had strong effects on the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the pond ecosystems. Light attenuation linearly increased with terrestrial DOC supply, which created a shading effect that negatively influenced whole-pond gross primary production and respiration. Despite this, bacterial contributions to basal energy mobilization and respiration increased with terrestrial DOC supply indicating that aquatic food webs were subsidized by terrestrial inputs. After establishing the DOC gradient, we used dynamic linear models to test the subsidy-stability hypothesis by measuring the resilience and sensitivity of each pond to a pulse nutrient perturbation. We found that recovery from the perturbation decreased nonlinearly along a gradient in terrestrial DOC supply. Reciprocal transplant experiments indicated that owing primarily to its light attenuating properties and recalcitrant nature, terrestrial DOC diminished aquatic ecosystem stability by reducing nutrient turnover rates (NTR). Together, our results demonstrate that global-change- mediated alterations in the movement of material and energy between habitats can have unpredictable and dramatic impacts on the reliability of ecosystem services.

TI  - From lake to estuary, the tale of two waters. A study of aquatic continuum biogeochemistry
PY  - 2017
AB  - The balance of fresh and saline water is essential to estuarine ecosystem function. Along the fresh-brackish-saline water gradient within the C-43 canal/Caloosahatchee River estuary (CRE) the quantity, timing and distribution of water and associated water quality significantly influences ecosystem function. Long-term trends of water quality and quantity were assessed from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE between May 1978 to April 2016. Significant changes to monthly flow volumes were detected between the lake and the estuary which correspond to changes in upstream management and climatic events. Across the 37-year period total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentration significantly increased at the lake, meanwhile total nitrogen (TN) FMW concentrations significantly declined at both the lake and estuary headwaters. Between May 1999 and April 2016, TN, TP and total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-P and ammonium conditions were assessed within the estuary at several monitoring locations. Generally nutrient concentrations decreased from upstream to downstream with shifts in TN:TP from values >20 in the freshwater portion, ~20 in the estuarine portion and

TI  - Do rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) invasions affect water clarity in north temperate lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasive crayfish can cause shifts in lakes from clear, macrophyte-dominated states to eutrophic, phytoplankton-dominated states because of their burrowing and foraging behavior. While invasive crayfish populations have been linked to declines in water clarity of shallow lakes and wetlands in Asia and Europe, little research has been done on the potential for similar effects of invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) in large temperate lakes of the Midwestern USA. We related F. rusticus abundance in 17 lakes of northern Wisconsin, USA over time (1984‒2018) to measures of lake clarity (chlorophyll a concentration and Secchi disc depth) estimated from remote sensing (Landsat imagery). Contrary to the effects of invasive crayfish in other study systems, we found a weak, positive association between F. rusticus abundance and water clarity. We propose that lake clarity may increase if declines in small fishes caused by F. rusticus lead to population growth of zooplankton and consequent decreases in phytoplankton through a trophic cascade. Alternatively, F. rusticus could be passengers to, rather than drivers of, lake clarity trends, responding positively to increased littoral benthic productivity when lakes are clearer. Future research should aim to determine if F. rusticus causes or responds to changes in water clarity, but should also investigate the impacts of crayfish invasions on water clarity across a greater variety of lentic ecosystems.

TI  - Assessing the seasonal dynamics of inundation, turbidity, and aquatic vegetation in the Australian wet–dry tropics using optical remote sensing
PY  - 2012
AB  - Floodplain wetlands in the wet–dry tropics are under increasing pressure from water resource development, and there is a need for methods to assess the biophysical dynamics of these extensive and often remote ecosystems. This study assessed the capacity of optical remote sensing methods to monitor the seasonal dynamics of inundation, turbidity, and aquatic vegetation cover for a northern Australian savanna catchment. MODIS data were used to map seasonal flood inundation patterns, and Landsat 5 TM data were used to map dry-season waterbody dynamics. A network of water-depth loggers and temperature sensors provided ground observations of surface inundation dynamics, and was used to validate the inundation mapping. Post-flood waterbody surface area declined by 89% over the dry season, with 70% of the decline occurring for Palustrine (floodplain) waterbodies. All aquatic systems became increasingly disconnected as the dry season progressed. Statistical relationships were developed between seasonal measurements of turbidity, aquatic vegetation cover, and Landsat spectral data. Catchment wide predictions showed that turbidity increased and macrophyte cover decreased for the Palustrine and Lacustrine (lake) systems, while the Riverine systems became less turbid over the dry season. These results show that, for open savanna landscapes where cloud cover does not limit waterbody detection, optical remote sensing methods can be effectively applied to assess seasonal patterns of inundation and accompanying biophysical dynamics. This provides an effective tool to evaluate the impact of river flow regime changes from water resource use or climate change in these regions. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The role of light availability and herbivory on algal responses to nutrient enrichment in a riparian wetland, Alaska.
PY  - 2015
AB  - We investigated how the relative availability of solar radiation in the presence or absence of grazing alters the ability of benthic algae to respond to nutrient enrichment in an Alaskan marsh. We used a factorial mesocosm experiment that included nutrient enrichment (enriched or control), grazing (grazed or ungrazed), and light (unshaded or shaded) to simulate shading by macrophytes early and late in the growing season, respectively. We found stronger effects of grazers and nutrients compared to light on benthic algal biomass and taxonomic composition. Algal biomass increased in nutrient-enriched treatments and was reduced by grazing. Shading did not have an effect on algal biomass or taxonomic composition, but the concentration of chl a per algal biovolume increased with shading, demonstrating the ability of algae to compensate for changes in light availability. Algal taxonomic composition was more affected by grazer presence than nutrients or light. Grazer-resistant taxa (basal filaments of Stigeoclonium) were replaced by diatoms (Nitzschia) and filamentous green algae (Ulothrix) when herbivores were removed. The interacting and opposing influences of nutrients and grazing indicate that the algal community is under dual control from the bottom-up (nutrient limitation) and from the top-down (consumption by herbivores), although grazers had a stronger influence on algal biomass and taxonomic composition than nutrient enrichment. Our results suggest that low light availability will not inhibit the algal response to elevated nutrient concentrations expected with ongoing climate change, but grazers rapidly consume algae following enrichment, masking the effects of elevated nutrients on algal production.

TI  - Peatland ditch blocking has no effect on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The globally widespread drainage of peatlands has often been shown to lead to increased concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams and rivers. Elevated DOC concentrations have implications for carbon cycling, ecosystem functioning, and potable water treatment. Peatland rewetting, principally through ditch blocking, is often carried out with the expectation that this will reduce DOC concentrations. Uncertainty still remains as to whether drainage, or its reversal via ditch blocking, will also lead to changes in the molecular composition of DOC/dissolved organic matter (DOM), which have the potential to affect downstream processing and treatability of U.K. drinking water supplies. To investigate this question, we used a replicated experiment consisting of 12 parallel ditches on an upland bog and took samples of ditch water, pore water, and overland flow water for 4 years. After a brief preblocking baseline period, eight ditches were blocked using two methods. A complementary suite of optical metrics, chemical measurements, and analytical techniques revealed that ditch blocking had no consistent effect on DOM quality, up to 4 years after blocking. Where significant differences were found, effect size calculations demonstrated that these differences were small and would therefore have minimal impact upon water treatability. Furthermore, some differences between ditches were evident before blocking took place, highlighting the need for robust baseline monitoring before intervention. Based on our results from a hillslope‐scale experiment, we were unable to identify clear evidence that peatland ditch blocking will deliver benefits in terms of DOM treatability in potable water supplies, although we also did not find any evidence of short‐term deterioration in water quality during the restoration period. We conclude that, although peatland restoration can be expected to deliver other benefits such as reduced carbon loss and enhanced biodiversity, it is doubtful whether it will lead to improvements in drinking water treatability.</jats:p>

TI  - The not-so-dead of winter: underwater light climate and primary productivity under snow and ice cover in inland lakes
PY  - 2022
AB  - As global surface temperatures continue to rise as a result of anthropogenic climate change, effects in temperate lakes are likely to be more pronounced than in other ecosystems. Decreases in snow and ice cover extent and duration and extended periods of summer stratification have been observed in temperate lake systems throughout the Anthropocene. However, the effects of changing snow and ice cover on lacustrine communities remain largely uninvestigated. We examined underwater light climate and associated primary productivity patterns under snow-covered and clear-lake ice in 6 inland lakes in Minnesota, USA, spanning gradients of water column optical properties (blue, green, brown) associated with trophic status and organic material content. In all lakes, snow cover influenced not only the intensity, but also the spectral signature of light penetrating into the water column. Specifically, the wavelength of maximum penetration was shifted towards longer wavelengths under snow cover in green (eutrophic) lakes but was shifted towards shorter wavelengths in blue and brown lakes. Volumetric primary productivity was often higher than anticipated (e.g., ∼1200 mg m−3 d−1; Lake Minnetonka, snow-covered ice). Carbon assimilation rates were lower under snow-covered ice throughout the water column in all lake types except immediately under cleared ice in eutrophic lakes, where phytoplankton were likely photoinhibited because of the penetration of intense, short-wavelength light. These findings suggest that changes to snow and ice cover under ongoing climate change scenarios can affect patterns of phytoplankton primary productivity in sensitive aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of permafrost degradation on water and sediment quality and heterotrophic bacterial production of Arctic tundra lakes: An experimental approach
PY  - 2015
AB  - To assess the effects of shoreline retrogressive thaw slumping on the chemical, physical, and ecological components of small tundra lakes, an in situ manipulative mesocosm experiment was performed in an upland, unslumped Arctic lake located near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada. Twelve replicate mesocosms were established: three control and three replicates of three treatment levels each dosed with differing amounts of soil sourced from the thaw scar of a nearby lake affected by shoreline retrogressive thaw slumping. The soil was rich in ionic compounds such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfates reflecting the marine origin of the local geology, and also contained nutrients (P and N) and organic carbon. Water column ionic and nutrient concentrations increased with increasing soil input, while pelagic bacterial production decreased. Conversely, benthic bacterial production increased by 44, 112, and 498% in the low, medium, and high soil treatments, respectively. This study shows thermokarst slumping to differentially affect pelagic and benthic heterotrophic microbial production through changes to the physical and chemical properties of the water and sediment. The stimulation of benthic and corresponding inhibition of pelagic heterotrophic productivity relative to the control treatments over the 12-week experimental period indicate that shoreline retrogressive thaw slumping alters heterotrophic energy pathways during the early successional stages of thermokarst lakes experiencing shoreline slumping.

TI  - Light climate and dissolved organic carbon concentration influence species-specific changes in fish zooplanktivory
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractDissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes reduces light penetration and limits fish production in low nutrient lakes, reportedly via reduced primary and secondary production. Alternatively, DOC and light reductions could influence fish by altering their visual feeding. Previous studies report mixed effects of DOC on feeding rates of zooplanktivorous fish, but most investigators tested effects of a single concentration of DOC against clear-water, turbid, or algal treatments. We used a controlled laboratory study to quantify the effects of a DOC gradient (3–19 mg L−1) on average light climate and the zooplankton feeding rate of 3 common, north temperate fishes. Light availability, which was inversely related to DOC concentration, had a positive and linear effect on zooplankton consumption by juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), explaining 22% and 28% of the variation in consumption, respectively. By contrast, zooplankton feeding rates by fathead minnow (...

TI  - The effect of peatland drainage and rewetting (ditch blocking) on extracellular enzyme activities and water chemistry
PY  - 2014
AB  - Extensive areas of European peatlands have been drained by digging ditches in an attempt to improve the land, resulting in increased carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere and enhanced fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Numerous peatland restoration projects have been initiated which aim to raise water tables by ditch blocking, thus reversing drainage-induced carbon losses. It has been suggested that extracellular hydrolase and phenol oxidase enzymes are partly responsible for controlling peatland carbon dynamics and that these enzymes are affected by environmental change. The aim of this study was to investigate how drainage and ditch blocking affect enzyme activities and water chemistry in a Welsh blanket bog, and to study the relationship between enzyme activity and water chemistry. A comparison of a drained and undrained site showed that the drained site had higher phenol oxidase and hydrolase activities, and lower concentrations of phenolic compounds which inhibit hydrolase enzymes. Ditch blocking had little impact upon enzyme activities; although hydrolase activities were lowered 4–9 months after restoration, the only significant difference was for arylsulphatase. Finally, we noted a negative correlation between b-glucosidase activity and DOC concentrations, and a positive correlation between arylsulphatase activity and sulphate concentration. Phenol oxidase activity was negatively correlated with DOC concentrations in pore water, but for ditch water phenol oxidase correlated negatively with the ratio of phenolics to DOC. Our results imply that drainage could exacerbate gaseous and fluvial carbon losses and that peatland restoration may not reverse the effects, at least in the short term.

TI  - DOM composition and transformation in boreal forest soils: The effects of temperature and organic‐horizon decomposition state
PY  - 2016
AB  - The boreal region stores large amounts of organic carbon (C) in organic-soil horizons, which are vulnerable to destabilization via warming and disturbance. Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) contributes to the production and turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM). While temperature is a primary control on rates of SOM and DOM cycling, little is known about temperature effects on DOM composition in soil leachate. Here, we conducted a 30-day incubation to examine the effects of temperature (20 vs. 5 °C) and SOM decomposition state (moss vs. fibric vs. amorphous horizons) on DOM composition in organic soils of interior Alaska. We characterized DOM using bulk dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration, chemical fractionation, optical properties, and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. We observed an increase in DOC concentration and DOM aromaticity in the 20 °C treatment compared to the 5 °C treatment. Leachate from fibric horizons had higher DOC concentration than shallow moss or deep amorphous horizons. We also observed chemical shifts in DOM leachate over time, including increases in hydrophobic organic acids, polyphenols, and condensed aromatics, and decreases in low-molecular weight hydrophilic compounds and aliphatics. We compared ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and optical data, and observed strong correlations between polyphenols, condensed aromatics, SUVA254, and humic-like fluorescence intensities. These findings suggest that bio-labile DOM was preferentially mineralized, and the magnitude of this transformation was determined by kinetics (i.e. temperature) and substrate quality (i.e. soil horizon). With future warming, our findings indicate that organic soils may release higher concentrations of aromatic DOM to aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Revisiting Odum (1956): A synthesis of aquatic ecosystem metabolism
PY  - 2013
AB  - H. T. Odum’s influential Limnology and Oceanography 1956 publication compared gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) among aquatic ecosystems. Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum’s conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n 5 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP:ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen enrichment on zooplankton biomass and N:P recycling ratios across a DOC gradient in northern-latitude lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - We used data from whole-lake studies to assess how changes in food quantity (phytoplankton biomass) and quality (phytoplankton community composition, seston C:P and N:P) with N fertilization affect zooplankton biomass, community composition and C:N:P stoichiometry, and their N:P recycling ratio along a gradient in lake DOC concentrations. We found that despite major differences in phytoplankton biomass with DOC (unimodal distributions, especially with N fertilization), no major differences in zooplankton biomass were detectable. Instead, phytoplankton to zooplankton biomass ratios were high, especially at intermediate DOC and after N fertilization, implying low trophic transfer efficiencies. An explanation for the observed low phytoplankton resource use, and biomass responses in zooplankton, was dominance of colony forming chlorophytes of reduced edibility at intermediate lake DOC, combined with reduced phytoplankton mineral quality (enhanced seston N:P) with N fertilization. N fertilization, however, increased zooplankton N:P recycling ratios, with largest impact at low DOC where phytoplankton benefitted from light sufficiently to cause enhanced seston N:P. Our results suggest that although N enrichment and increased phytoplankton biomass do not necessarily increase zooplankton biomass, bottom-up effects may still impact zooplankton and their N:P recycling ratio through promotion of phytoplankton species of low edibility and altered mineral quality.

TI  - Attached Algae: The Cryptic Base of Inverted Trophic Pyramids in Freshwaters
PY  - 2017
AB  - It seems improbable that a thin veneer of attached algae coating submerged surfaces in lakes and rivers could be the foundation of many freshwater food webs, but increasing evidence from chemical tracers supports this view. Attached algae grow on any submerged surface that receives enough light for photosynthesis, but animals often graze attached algae down to thin, barely perceptible biofilms. Algae in general are more nutritious and digestible than terrestrial plants or detritus, and attached algae are particularly harvestable, being concentrated on surfaces. Diatoms, a major component of attached algal assemblages, are especially nutritious and tolerant of heavy grazing. Algivores can track attached algal productivity over a range of spatial scales and consume a high proportion of new attached algal growth in high-light, low-nutrient ecosystems. The subsequent efficient conversion of the algae into consumer production in freshwater food webs can lead to low-producer, high-consumer biomass, patterns tha...

AB  - Most ﬁshes undergo ontogenetic diet shifts during early development (Crowder C Luecke, 1986). When hatching they are severely gape size limited.During growth, gape size and prey-size ‘windows’ increase, and shifts to larger preyitems are possible (Wong & Ward, 1972; Werner, 1974; Unger & Lewis, 1983).These ontogenetic diet shifts also change predation pressures across prey communi-ties and thereby incur consequences for trophic interactions.

TI  - The complementary power of pH and lake water organic carbon reconstructions  for discerning the influences on surface waters across decadal to millennial  time scales
PY  - 2011
AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Lake Lysevatten has experienced both acidification and recent changes in the amount of lake water organic carbon (TOC) over which is causing concern across Europe and North America. A range of paleolimnological tools – diatom inferred pH, inferred lake water TOC from visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS), multi-element geochemistry and pollen analysis, combined with geochemical modeling were used to reconstruct the lake's chemistry and surroundings back to the most recent deglaciation 12 500 years ago. The results reveal that the recent anthropogenic impacts are similar in magnitude to the long-term variation driven by natural catchment changes and early agricultural land use occurring over centuries and millennia. The combined reconstruction of both lake water TOC and lithogenic element delivery can explain the major changes in lake-water pH and modeled acid neutralizing capacity during the past 12 500 years. The results raise important questions regarding what precisely comprises ''reference'' conditions (i.e., free from human impacts) as encapsulated in the European Water Framework Directive. </jats:p>

TI  - Resource synergy in stream periphyton communities
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Light and nutrients play pivotal roles in determining the growth of autotrophs, yet the potential for synergistic interactions between the two resources in algal communities is poorly understood, especially in stream ecosystems. In this study, light and phosphorus were manipulated in large experimental streams to examine resource colimitation and synergy in stream periphyton. 2. Whole-stream metabolism was simultaneously limited by light and phosphorus. Increasing the supply of either light or phosphorus resulted in significant increases in primary production and the transformation of the streams from heterotrophy to autotrophy. 3. Resource-driven changes in periphyton community structure occurred in concert with changes in production. Algal assemblages in highly shaded streams were composed primarily of small diatoms such as Achnanthidium minutissima, whereas larger diatoms such as Melosira varians predominated at higher irradiances. Phosphorus enrichment had relatively little effect on assemblage structure, but it did substantially diminish the abundance of Meridion circulare, a diatom whose mucilaginous colonies were conspicuously abundant in phosphorus-poor, high-light streams. Bacterial biomass declined relative to algal biomass with increases in primary productivity, regardless of whether the increases were caused by light or phosphorus. 4. Synergistic effects on primary production appeared to occur because the availability of one resource facilitated the utilization of the other. Light increased the abundance of large diatoms, which are known to convert high concentrations of nutrients into primary production more effectively than smaller taxa. Phosphorus enrichment led to the replacement of Meridion circulare by non-mucilaginous taxa in phosphorus-enriched streams, and we hypothesize that this change enabled more efficient use of light in photosynthesis. Higher ratios of chlorophyll a :b iomass in phosphorus-enriched streams may have also led to more efficient photon capture and higher photosynthetic rates. 5. Synthesis. Our results underscore the potential for resource colimitation, even in habitats where a single resource is as strongly limiting as is light in shaded streams. The capacity of autotrophic communities to respond to more than one limiting resource suggests that prevailing single-resource models of ecosystem productivity are overly simplistic.

TI  - Oxygen Depletion in Arctic Lakes: Circumpolar Trends, Biogeochemical Processes, and Implications of Climate Change
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Polar amplification of climate change has the potential to cause large‐scale shifts in the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of Arctic lakes, with implications for fish survival, greenhouse gas production, and drinking water quality. While DO is also a sentinel of environmental changes of physical, chemical, and biological nature (e.g., ice cover, temperature, dissolved organic carbon, photosynthesis, and respiration), no synthesis exists of current knowledge of DO dynamics across the diverse freshwater systems of the Arctic. We thus conducted a systematic review of the literature that yielded DO data from 167 sites north of the Subarctic limit (based on vegetation zones), spanning 76 years and including 40 sites with time series. The compilation revealed insufficient observations for adequate representativeness of oxygen dynamics over Arctic ecosystem gradients. We described the main processes controlling DO budgets of Arctic lakes and tested relationships of summer oxygen depletion with maximum depth and latitude. The meta‐analysis showed that most sites with low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations were shallow (&lt;10 m) and situated toward the southern end of the latitudinal gradient. Permanently stratified lakes with deep, perennially anoxic basins were located toward the northern end of the gradient. By way of a conceptual model, we identified the direct and indirect drivers and mechanisms that lead to changes in oxygen budgets in the context of the warming Arctic. This comprehensive update on available data allowed us to suggest future research directions and recommend the use of moored instruments for continuous all‐season observations, combined with modeling, remote sensing, and paleo‐reconstructions.</jats:p>

TI  - Improving Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) Retrievals by Sentinel2-MSI Data through a Total Suspended Matter (TSM)-Driven Classification: The Case of Pertusillo Lake (Southern Italy)
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a significant constituent of aquatic systems and biogeochemical cycles. Satellite CDOM retrievals are challenging in inland waters, due to overlapped absorption properties of bio-optical parameters, like Total Suspended Matter (TSM). In this framework, we defined an accurate CDOM model using Sentinel2-MSI (S2-MSI) data in Pertusillo Lake (Southern Italy) adopting a classification scheme based on satellite TSM data. Empirical relationships were established between the CDOM absorption coefficient, aCDOM (440), and reflectance band ratios using ground-based measurements. The Green-to-Red (B3/B4 and B3/B5) and Red-to-Blue (B4/B2 and B5/B2) band ratios showed good relationships (R2 ≥ 0.75), which were further improved according to sub-region division (R2 up to 0.93). The best accuracy of B3/B4 in the match-ups between S2-MSI-derived and in situ band ratios proved the exportability on S2-MSI data of two B3/B4-based aCDOM (440) models, namely the fixed (for the whole PL) and the switching one (according to sub-region division). Although they both exhibited good agreements in aCDOM (440) retrievals (R2 ≥ 0.69), the switching model showed the highest accuracy (RMSE of 0.0155 m−1). Finally, the identification of areas exposed to different TSM patterns can assist with refining the calibration/validation procedures to achieve more accurate aCDOM (440) retrievals.</jats:p>

TI  - Centennial-long trends of lake browning show major effect of afforestation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Observations of increasing water color and organic carbon concentrations in lakes are widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. The drivers of these trends are debated. Declining atmospheric sulfur deposition has been put forward as an important underlying factor, since recovery from acidification enhances mobility of organic matter from surrounding soils. This would suggest that the current browning represents a return to a more natural state. This study explores historical lake data from Sweden—1935 to 2015—providing a unique opportunity to see how and why water color has varied during almost a century. The data shows that sulfur deposition has not been the primary driver of water color trends over this period. I propose that the observed browning is to a large extent driven by a major transition from agriculture to forestry.

TI  - Response of Submerged Macrophyte Growth, Morphology, Chlorophyll Content and Nutrient Stoichiometry to Increased Flow Velocity and Elevated CO2 and Dissolved Organic Carbon Concentrations
PY  - 2020
AB  - It is expected that climate change will cause more frequent extreme events of heavy precipitation and drought, changing hydrological conditions in riverine ecosystems, such as flow velocity, evapotranspiration (drought) or runoff (heavy precipitation). This can lead to an increased input of terrestrial organic matter and elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CO2 due to degradational processes in water. Consequences for submerged macrophytes, as essential organism group, are still poorly understood. The combined effects of changing flow velocity, DOC and CO2 have not been studied before, so this was tested in a racetrack flume experiment on the macrophyte Berula erecta using a trait-based approach. The plants were exposed to two different flow velocities, two DOC concentrations and two CO2 concentrations in a full factorial design. Apart from individual dose-response tests, two climate change scenarios were tested: a wet scenario simulating heavy precipitation and runoff with high flow velocity, high DOC and CO2 concentrations and a dry scenario simulating evapotranspiration with low flow velocity, high DOC and high CO2 concentrations. Growth rate, biomass, morphology, chlorophyll and nutrient content (C, N and P) were measured. B. erecta responded strongly to both scenarios. Biomass and the relative growth rate increased and stems were shorter, especially in the wet scenario, and vegetative reproduction (the number of stolons) decreased. In both scenarios, the N content was lower and P content higher than in conditions without climate change. It can be concluded that climate change effects, especially shading by DOC, strongly influence macrophytes: macrophyte abundance will probably be negatively affected by climate change, depending on the macrophyte species and abundance of epiphytic algae. This may have consequences for other components of the aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - Phytoplankton community in early stages of reservoir development-a case study from the newly formed, colored, and episodic lake of mining-subsidence genesis
PY  - 2014
AB  - Mining activities affect a landscape in different ways, including by the formation of subsidence troughs, which after being inundated form wetlands and lakes. The development of new mining reservoirs may give a unique opportunity to study the early stages of colonization by various freshwater communities, including phytoplankton. Our paper presents the results of phycological research undertaken in newly formed subsidence reservoir near the coal mine “Bogdanka” (Polesie Lubelskie) a few months after its filling with water. The reservoir represented a unique, rare limnologic type due to the fact that it disappeared as a result of intended melioration works in the autumn of the same year. The study focused on morphometric measurements of the episodic reservoir, determination of general physicochemical parameters of water, and qualitative and quantitative structure of the phytoplankton community, was undertaken in five separated basins. A total of 80 algal taxa were determined. Most of them belonged to euglenoids (Euglenophyta-36) and green algae (Chlorophyta-26). Among euglenoids, most species were represented by Trachelomonas genus (14), while among green algae, most species were assigned to Scenedesmus genus (8). Several rare species were found, including: Scenedesmus bacillaris Gutw., Dinobryon petiolatum Willen, and Trachelomonas botanica Playfair. Green algae and euglenoids also had major contributions to the total phytoplankton abundance, which �

We also describe how freshwaters influence the adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. A better understanding of these dynamic biotic and abiotic interactions between land and freshwater of the boreal forest is a first step toward including these freshwaters in the sustainable management of the boreal forest.</jats:p>

TI  - Impacts of climate warming on the long-term dynamics of key fish species in 24 European lakes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Fish play a key role in the trophic dynamics of lakes. With climate warming, complex changes in fish assemblage structure may be expected owing to direct effects of temperature and indirect effects operating through eutrophication, water level changes, stratification and salinisation. We reviewed published and new long-term (10–100 years) fish data series from 24 European lakes (area: 0.04–5,648 km2; mean depth: 1–177 m; a north–south gradient from Sweden to Spain). Along with an annual temperature increase of about 0.15–0.3°C per decade profound changes have occurred in either fish assemblage composition, body size and/or age structure during recent decades and a shift towards higher dominance of eurythermal species. These shifts have occurred despite a reduction in nutrient loading in many of the lakes that should have benefited the larger-sized individuals and the fish species typically inhabiting cold-water, low-nutrient lakes. The cold-stenothermic Arctic charr has been particularly affected and its abundance has decreased in the majority of the lakes where its presence was recorded. The harvest of cool-stenothermal brown trout has decreased substantially in two southern lakes. Vendace, whitefish and smelt show a different response depending on lake depth and latitude. Perch has apparently been stimulated in the north, with stronger year classes in warm years, but its abundance has declined in the southern Lake Maggiore, Italy. Where introduced, roach seems to take advantage of the higher temperature after years of low population densities. Eurythermal species such as common bream, pike–perch and/or shad are apparently on the increase in several of the lakes. The response of fish to the warming has been surprisingly strong and fast in recent decades, making them ideal sentinels for detecting and documenting climate-induced modifications of freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Reevaluating the Role of Organic Matter Sources for Coastal Eutrophication, Oligotrophication, and Ecosystem Health
PY  - 2019
AB  - Organic matter (OM) in aquatic systems is either produced internally (autochthonous OM) or delivered from the terrestrial environment (ter-OM). For eutrophication (or the reverse – oligotrophication), the amount of autochthonous OM plays a key role for coastal ecosystem health. However, the influence of ter-OM on eutrophication or oligotrophication processes of coastal ecosystems is largely unclear. Therefore, ter-OM, or ter-OM proxies are currently not included in most policies or monitoring programs on eutrophication. Nevertheless, ter-OM is increasingly recognized as a strong driver of aquatic productivity: By influencing underwater light conditions and nutrient- and carbon availability, increased ter-OM input may shift systems from autotrophic towards heterotrophic production, but also alter the interactions between benthic and pelagic habitats. Thus, by changing baseline conditions in coastal zones, ongoing and predicted changes in inputs of ter-OM due to climate change (e.g. in precipitation) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. reduced sulfate deposition, damming, coastal erosion) may strongly modify eutrophication symptoms within affected ecosystems, but also hinder recovery from eutrophication following a reduction in nutrient loadings (i.e. oligotrophication). In this review, we aim to shed light upon the role of ter-OM for coastal eutrophication and oligotrophication processes and ecosystem health. Specifically, we (1) discuss the theoretical interactions between ter-OM and eutrophication and oligotrophication processes in coastal waters, (2) present global case studies where altered ter-OM supply to coastal ecosystems has shifted baseline conditions, with implications for eutrophication and oligotrophication processes, and (3) provide an outlook and recommendations for the future management of coastal zones given changes in ter-OM input. We conclude that it is essential to include and target all OM sources (i.e. also ter-OM) in monitoring programs to better understand the consequences of both eutrophication and oligotrophication processes on coastal ecosystems. Our review strongly urges to include ter-OM, or ter-OM proxies in eutrophication monitoring and policies to safeguard coastal ecosystem health also under changing climatic conditions and globally increasing anthropogenic perturbations of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - The hub of the wheel or hitchhikers? The potential influence of large avian herbivores on other trophic levels in wetland ecosystems
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Goose and swan populations have increased concurrently with environmental degradation of wetlands, such as eutrophication, vegetation losses, and decrease in biodiversity. An important question is whether geese and swans contribute to such changes or if they instead benefit from them. We collected data from 37 wetlands in southern Sweden April − July 2021 to study relationships between geese, swans and other waterbird guilds, macrophytes, invertebrates, as well as physical and water chemistry variables. Neither goose nor swan abundance was negatively correlated with other trophic levels (abundance, richness, or cover). On the contrary, goose or swan abundances were positively related to abundances of surface and benthic feeding waterbirds, cover of specific macrophytes, and to invertebrate richness and abundance. Moreover, invertebrates (number of taxa or abundance) were positively associated with abundance of several waterbird guilds and total phosphorous with surface feeders, whereas water colour was positively (surface feeders) or negatively (benthic feeders) related. We conclude that waterbirds are more abundant in productive wetlands and that geese and swans do not show clear deleterious effects on other trophic levels included in this study. However, patterns may be masked at the species level, which should be addressed in further studies, complemented with experimental studies of grazing impact.</jats:p>

TI  - Quantifying the relative importance of lake emissions in the carbon budget of a subarctic catchment
PY  - 2010
AB  - Climate change and thawing of permafrost will likely result in increased decomposition of terrestrial organic carbon and subsequent carbon emissions to the atmosphere from terrestrial and aquatic systems. The quantitative importance of mineralization of terrestrial organic carbon in lakes in relation to terrestrial carbon fluxes is poorly understood and a serious drawback for the understanding of carbon budgets. We studied a subarctic lake in an area of discontinuous permafrost to assess the quantitative importance of lake carbon emission for the catchment carbon balance. Estimates of net ecosystem production and stable carbon-isotope composition of dissolved organic carbon in the lake water suggest substantial input and respiration of terrestrial organic carbon in the lake. The lake was a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere at ice breakup in spring and during the whole ice-free period. The carbon emission from the lake was similar in magnitude to the terrestrial net release of carbon to the atmosphere. The results indicate that lakes are important sources of catchment carbon emission, potentially increasing the positive feedback from permafrost thawing on global warming.

TI  - Sentinel responses of Arctic freshwater systems to climate: linkages, evidence, and a roadmap for future research
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>While the sentinel nature of freshwater systems is now well recognized, widespread integration of freshwater processes and patterns into our understanding of broader climate-driven Arctic terrestrial ecosystem change has been slow. We review the current understanding across Arctic freshwater systems of key sentinel responses to climate, which are attributes of these systems with demonstrated and sensitive responses to climate forcing. These include ice regimes, temperature and thermal structure, river baseflow, lake area and water level, permafrost-derived dissolved ions and nutrients, carbon mobilization (dissolved organic carbon, greenhouse gases, and radiocarbon), dissolved oxygen concentrations, lake trophic state, various aquatic organisms and their traits, and invasive species. For each sentinel, our objectives are to clarify linkages to climate, describe key insights already gained, and provide suggestions for future research based on current knowledge gaps. We suggest that tracking key responses in Arctic freshwater systems will expand understanding of the breadth and depth of climate-driven Arctic ecosystem changes, provide early indicators of looming, broader changes across the landscape, and improve protection of freshwater biodiversity and resources.</jats:p>

TI  - Forcing mechanisms behind variations in TOC concentration of lake waters Forcing mechanisms behind variations in total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of lake waters during the past eight centuries – palaeolimnological evidence from southern Sweden Forcing mechanisms behind variations in TOC concentration of lake waters
PY  - 2013
AB  - Decadal-scale variations in total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in lake water since AD 1200 in two small lakes in southern Sweden were reconstructed based on visible-near infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) of their recent sediment successions. In order to assess the impacts of local land-use changes and regional variations in 5 sulphur deposition and climate on the inferred changes in TOC concentration, the same sediment records were subjected to multi-proxy palaeolimnological analyses. Changes in lake-water pH were inferred from diatom analysis, whereas pollen-based land-use reconstructions (Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm) together with geo-chemical records provided information on catchment-scale environmental changes, 10 and comparisons were made with available records of climate and population density. Our long-term reconstructions reveal that TOC concentrations were generally high prior to AD 1900, with second-order variations coupled mainly to changes in agricultural land-use intensity. The last century showed significant changes, and unusually low TOC concentrations were recorded in 1930–1990, followed by a recent increase. Vari-15 ations in sulphur emissions, with an increase in the early 1900s to a peak around AD 1980 and a subsequent decrease, were most likely the main driver of these dynamics, although processes related to the introduction of modern forestry and recent increases in precipitation and temperature may have contributed. The increase in lake-water TOC concentration from around AD 1980 may therefore reflect a recovery process. Given 20 that the effects of sulphate deposition now subside, other forcing mechanisms related to land management and climate change will possibly become the main drivers of TOC concentration changes in boreal lake waters in the future.

TI  - Drivers and variability of CO2:O2 saturation along a gradient from boreal to Arctic lakes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lakes are significant players for the global climate since they sequester terrestrially derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and emit greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. However, the differences in environmental drivers of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are not well constrained along latitudinal and thus climate gradients. Our aim here is to provide a better understanding of net heterotrophy and gas balance at the catchment scale in a set of boreal, sub-Arctic and high-Arctic lakes. We assessed water chemistry and concentrations of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio in three groups of lakes separated by steps of approximately 10 degrees latitude in South-Eastern Norway (near 60° N), sub-Arctic lakes in the northernmost part of the Norwegian mainland (near 70° N) and high-Arctic lakes on Svalbard (near 80° N). Across all regions, CO<sub>2</sub> saturation levels varied more (6-1374%) than O<sub>2</sub> saturation levels (85-148%) and hence CO<sub>2</sub> saturation governed the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio. The boreal lakes were generally undersaturated with O<sub>2</sub>, while the sub-Arctic and high-Arctic lakes ranged from O<sub>2</sub> saturated to oversaturated. Regardless of location, the majority of the lakes were CO<sub>2</sub> supersaturated. In the boreal lakes the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio was mainly related to DOC concentration, in contrast to the sub-Arctic and high-Arctic localities, where conductivity was the major statistical determinant. While the southern part is dominated by granitic and metamorphic bedrock, the sub-Arctic sites are scattered across a range of granitic to sedimentary bed rocks, and the majority of the high-Arctic lakes are situated on limestone, resulting in contrasting lake alkalinities between the regions. DOC dependency of the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio in the boreal region together with low alkalinity suggests that in-lake heterotrophic respiration was a major source of lake CO<sub>2</sub>. Contrastingly, the conductivity dependency indicates that CO<sub>2</sub> saturation in the sub-Arctic and high-Arctic lakes was to a large part explained by DIC input from catchment respiration and carbonate weathering.

TI  - Scaling of increased dissolved organic carbon inputs by forest clear-cutting - What arrives downstream?
PY  - 2014
AB  - summary Forest clear-cutting has been found to significantly increase concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in boreal first-order streams. Here, we address the questions of (1) how the additional inputs of DOC by upstream forest harvesting affect downstream locations within a stream network and (2) what catchment area has to be harvested to cause a significant downstream increase in DOC concentration. We combined the use of primary data from a paired-catchment experiment, clear-cut history of a nested stream network derived from satellite images with a mixing-model approach in order to quantify the importance of upstream clear-cuts on two downstream sites with different catchment sizes. Modeled [DOC] agreed well with the measured concentrations in the smaller, 8.7 km 2 catchment located above a larger wetland area, but discrepancies occurred for the larger 22.9 km 2 catchment located downstream of the wetland. Estimates of the critical area (Acritical) needed to be harvested to cause a significant impact on downstream DOC concentrations was quantified to be 11% for p < 0.05 and 23–25% for p < 0.001. Our results suggests that (i) increased DOC concentrations induced by forest harvesting affect downstream sites and (ii) additional DOC inputs by harvests have a significant impact on stream water quality, if harvests exceed Acritical. We suggest that the estimates of Acritical could be used in sensitive river networks to provide harvesting-thresholds. The latter could be implemented into forest planning that includes considerations of the negative impact of clear-cutting on water quality.

TI  - Feeling the Squeeze: Adult Run Size and Habitat Availability Limit Juvenile River Herring Densities in Lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Maximum densities of juvenile river herring (Alewife <jats:italic>Alosa pseudoharengus</jats:italic> and Blueback Herring <jats:italic>A. aestivalis</jats:italic>) vary among freshwater lakes, likely due to densities of adult spawners. Differences in habitat availability and lake water quality may also contribute to variation in juvenile river herring productivity between populations, yet these relationships have not been tested across a large geographic scope. In this study we investigated relationships between juvenile river herring densities and (1) spawning adult river herring densities, (2) lake habitat availability, and (3) lake water quality in 29 freshwater lakes in the northeastern USA. Purse seines were used at night to sample juvenile river herring monthly in June–August 2014 and 2015, with concurrent collection of lake‐specific physical (e.g., lake surface area, mean depth, depth to thermocline), chemical (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon [DOC]), and biological (chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>, adult spawning density) data. Spawning adult density (number of adults per surface area of lake) explained 66.6% of the variation in juvenile densities using a generalized additive model. Juvenile densities increased with increasing adult density, peaking at roughly 1,000 adults/ha, and then declined at higher adult densities, suggesting a limit to carrying capacity in juvenile production. Linear mixed‐effects models revealed that differences in water quality and habitat across lakes explained additional variation in juvenile densities. Specifically, DOC was negatively related to juvenile densities, suggesting that DOC limits the amount of suitable, well‐oxygenated epilimnion habitat available to juvenile river herring in late summer. Our results can be used to help understand expected juvenile production based on adult density within a lake, to inform expectations about juvenile growth and survival, and to understand the mechanisms for how changes in habitat availability and water quality affect river herring populations.</jats:p>

TI  - Resolving the Drivers of Algal Nutrient Limitation from Boreal to Arctic Lakes and Streams
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Nutrient inputs to northern freshwaters are changing, potentially altering aquatic ecosystem functioning through effects on primary producers. Yet, while primary producer growth is sensitive to nutrient supply, it is also constrained by a suite of other factors, including light and temperature, which may play varying roles across stream and lake habitats. Here, we use bioassay results from 89 lakes and streams spanning northern boreal to Arctic Sweden to test for differences in nutrient limitation status of algal biomass along gradients in colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC), water temperature, and nutrient concentrations, and to ask whether there are distinct patterns and drivers between habitats. Single nitrogen (N) limitation or primary N-limitation with secondary phosphorus (P) limitation of algal biomass was the most common condition for streams and lakes. Average response to N-addition was a doubling in biomass; however, the degree of limitation was modulated by the distinct physical and chemical conditions in lakes versus streams and across boreal to Arctic regions. Overall, algal responses to N-addition were strongest at sites with low background concentrations of dissolved inorganic N. Low temperatures constrained biomass responses to added nutrients in lakes but had weaker effects on responses in streams. Further, DOC mediated the response of algal biomass to nutrient addition differently among lakes and streams. Stream responses were dampened at higher DOC, whereas lake responses to nutrient addition increased from low to moderate DOC but were depressed at high DOC. Our results suggest that future changes in nutrient availability, particularly N, will exert strong effects on the trophic state of northern freshwaters. However, we highlight important differences in the physical and chemical factors that shape algal responses to nutrient availability in different parts of aquatic networks, which will ultimately affect the integrated response of northern aquatic systems to ongoing environmental changes.</jats:p>

TI  - Linking zooplankton richness with energy input and insularity along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients
PY  - 2016
AB  - Altitudinal and latitudinal gradients are excellent venues for investigating the direct and indirect effects of air temperature, solar irradiance, and insularity on spatial patterns of aquatic biodiversity. The findings can be used to predict how lake communities will respond to increasingly extreme climate events. We explored hypotheses of energy/climate, geography, and glacial history explaining patterns in species richness in a historical dataset of crustacean zooplankton communities from 436 lakes in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. GIS-based estimates of solar and thermal energy inputs combined with habitat area and insularity provided the best prediction of local species richness. Energetic and geographic factors explained a moderate proportion of the total variation in species richness (Generalized R2 = 0.50), and were sufficient to account for both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in zooplankton diversity. History of deglaciation was not supported as a predictor of patterns in species richness. A post hoc analysis with a smaller dataset also found strong support for lake pH, and some support for fish presence as predictors of species richness, but these only increased the proportion of the total variation explained very slightly relative to the model including only energetic and geographic factors (Generalized R2 = 0.55 vs. 0.53). Our findings highlight the multiplicity of local and regional factors of zooplankton species richness in mountain lakes, forecasting that it will increase under a scenario of warmer and drier (i.e., less cloud cover) conditions, especially in high connectivity lakes that cease to be fed by rapidly disappearing glaciers.

TI  - From greening to browning: Catchment vegetation development and reduced S-deposition promote organic carbon load on decadal time scales in Nordic lakes.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), often labelled "browning", is a current trend in northern, particularly boreal, freshwaters. The browning has been attributed to the recent reduction in sulphate (S) deposition during the last 2 to 3 decades. Over the last century, climate and land use change have also caused an increasing trend in vegetation cover ("greening"), and this terrestrially fixed carbon represents another potential source for export of organic carbon to lakes and rivers. The impact of this greening on the observed browning of lakes and rivers on decadal time scales remains poorly investigated, however. Here, we explore time-series both on water chemistry and catchment vegetation cover (using NDVI as proxy) from 70 Norwegian lakes and catchments over a 30-year period. We show that the increase in terrestrial vegetation as well as temperature and runoff significantly adds to the reduced SO4-deposition as a driver of freshwater DOC concentration. Over extended periods (centuries), climate mediated changes in vegetation cover may cause major browning of northern surface waters, with severe impact on ecosystem productivity and functioning.

TI  - Benthic–limnetic morphological variation in fishes: Dissolved organic carbon concentration produces unexpected patterns
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Variation in traits related to foraging and locomotion in benthic and limnetic habitats has been observed in many fishes. Benthic and limnetic food chain productivity in lakes is strongly influenced by the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water, suggesting that DOC might indirectly impose selection on these traits and lead to classic benthic forms at low DOC concentrations and limnetic forms at high DOC concentrations. We tested this hypothesis via geometric morphometric and meristic analyses of bluegill sunfish (<jats:italic>Lepomis macrochirus</jats:italic>, Centrarchidae) from 14 lakes with DOC concentrations ranging from 4 to 24 mg/L. These lakes, located in close proximity to each other, straddle the drainage divide between the Mississippi River and Laurentian Great Lakes basins in northern Wisconsin, USA. Bluegill morphology was consistently related to lake DOC concentration in both drainage basins, despite differences in morphology between basins. Fish from higher DOC lakes had deeper bodies and smaller heads, among other differences, though the proportion of shape variation described by DOC was low. Gill raker length and inter‐raker spacing were positively related to DOC concentration. Although some traits were thus related to DOC concentration, the directions of these relationships did not match the predicted benthic–limnetic patterns. Further, no relationships were evident between DOC and gill raker number, eye width, pectoral fin dimensions, or pectoral fin insertion angle in univariate analyses. These variable outcomes suggest that selection linked to DOC does not map neatly onto the classic benthic–limnetic axis, that high DOC favors a benthic–limnetic generalist rather than a limnetic specialist, or that the benthic–limnetic morphological dichotomy is less clear and universal than is often suggested.</jats:p>

TI  - Catchment properties as predictors of greenhouse gas concentrations across a gradient of boreal lakes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Boreal lakes are the most abundant lakes on Earth. Changes in acid rain deposition, climate, and catchment land use have increased lateral fluxes of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), resulting in a widespread browning of boreal freshwaters. This browning affects the aqueous communities and ecosystem processes, and boost emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. In this study, we predicted biotic saturation of GHGs in boreal lakes by using a set of chemical, hydrological, climate, and land use parameters. For this purpose, concentrations of GHGs and nutrients (organic C, -P, and -N) were determined in surface water samples from 73 lakes in south-eastern Norway covering wide ranges in DOM and nutrient concentrations, as well as catchment properties and land use. The spatial variation in saturation of each GHG is related to explanatory variables. Catchment characteristics (hydrological and climate parameters) such as lake size and summer precipitation, as well as NDVI, were key determinants when fitting GAM models for CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (explaining 71 and 54%, respectively), while summer precipitation and land use data were the best predictors for the N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O saturation, explaining almost 50% of deviance. Our results suggest that lake size, precipitation, and terrestrial primary production in the watershed control the saturation of GHG in boreal lakes. These predictions based on the 73-lake dataset was validated against an independent dataset from 46 lakes in the same region. Together, this provides an improved understanding of drivers and spatial variation in GHG saturation in boreal lakes across wide gradients of lake and catchment properties. The assessment highlights the need to incorporate multiple explanatory parameters in prediction models of GHGs for extrapolation across the boreal biome.</jats:p>

TI  - Long-term changes in physical environments and potential implications for the eco-environment of Lake Taihu in the past four decades
PY  - 2020
AB  - 过去40年，全球气候变暖、辐射变暗和变亮、风速减弱、气候异常波动等自然环境变化以及筑坝建闸、岸堤硬质化和调水引流等强烈人类活动势必会深刻改变太湖湖泊物理环境和过程，驱动湖泊生态系统演化.基于历史文献、档案数据以及气象水文和透明度等长期观测数据，本文系统梳理了太湖气温、水温、风速、水位和透明度等物理环境空间分布和长期变化特征，探讨了气温和风速、水位和透明度相互协同作用机制及其潜在生态环境意义.受全球变化和城市化等影响，过去40年太湖气温和水温呈现显著升高趋势，而近地面风速则表现为持续下降，湖泊增温和风速下降有利于藻类生长和蓝藻水华漂浮聚集，某种程度上增加了蓝藻水华出现频次和集聚的面积.为防洪和满足流域日益增长的水资源需求，闸坝管控和调水引流使太湖水位呈现缓慢增加趋势，而入湖污染物增加和富营养化则造成水体透明度逐渐下降，致使透明度与水位（水深）的比值明显降低，减少了湖底可利用光强，恶化水下光环境，在一定程度上驱动了太湖水生植被和草型生态系统退化.湖泊物理环境长期变化逐渐拓展了太湖藻型生境空间而压缩了草型生境空间，加剧了草型生态系统向藻型生态系统转化和增强了藻型生态系统的自我长期维持.太湖湖泊物理环境的显著变化也会部分抵消流域营养盐削减和湖体营养盐下降对藻类生物量和蓝藻水华的控制，增加了太湖蓝藻水华防控和湖泊富营养化治理的难度.这意味着未来流域控源截污需要更加严格的标准，而湖泊水位等物理环境的有效管控是应对藻华加剧和恢复草型生态系统的适应性管理策略.;The global environment has experienced rapid changes over the past four decades, including global climate warming, radiation dimming and brightening, wind stilling, and abnormal climate fluctuations. Meanwhile, strong human activities such as dam construction, bank hardening and water diversion and drainage have happened in Lake Taihu catchment. All these changes of natural environments and human activities have profoundly reshaped the physical environments and processes of Lake Taihu, which have further strongly driven the evolution of lake ecosystem structure and function. Based on historical literatures and documents, as well as long-term observations of meteorology, hydrology and Secchi disc depth (SDD), this study aims to systematically explore the spatial distribution and long-term change characteristics of physical environment in Lake Taihu, such as air temperature, water temperature, water level, wind speed and SDD. Meanwhile, we will elucidate the synergistic effects of air temperature and wind speed, water level and SDD and their potential ecological environmental significances for algal bloom outbreaks and aquatic macrophytes loss. Due to the global changes and rapid urbanization, the air temperature and water temperature of Lake Taihu have been increasing continuously in the past 40 years, while the wind speed near the ground has been decreasing continuously. Lake warming and decreasing wind speed facilitate the growth of algae and the floating accumulation of cyanobacteria bloom, which to some extent increases the observation frequency and area of cyanobacteria bloom. In order to control the flood and meet the increasing demand of water resources in the basin, the water level of Lake Taihu is increasing slowly due to dam control and water diversion. However, the increase of pollutants entering the lake and the development of eutrophication gradually decrease SDD. Therefore, the significant decrease of the ratio of SDD to water level (water depth) was observed in Lake Taihu, which significantly decreased the available light intensity at the bottom of the lake, and deteriorate the underwater light environment. All these changes have resulted in the loss of aquatic macrophytes and greatly driven the degradation of macrophyte-dominated ecosystem in Lake Taihu. The long-term changes of lake physical environment have gradually expanded the algae habitat space of Lake Taihu, compressed the macrophyte habitat space, accelerated the shift from a clear macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid algal-dominated state, and enhanced the long-term maintenance of algal-dominated ecosystem. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of long-term physical environment monitoring data for deeply understanding ecosystem response to global climate change and human activities. The profound changes in physical environment has also partially offset the control of algal biomass and cyanobacteria bloom caused by the reduction of nutrients in the basin and the decrease of nutrients in the lake, which will increase the difficulty of prevention and control of cyanobacteria bloom and lake eutrophication in Lake Taihu. This means that in the future, more strict standards are needed for controlling pollution and nutrients, and the effective control of lake physical environment such as water level is the adaptive management strategy to deal with the aggravation of algal bloom and the restoration of macrophyte-dominated ecosystem.

TI  - Climate warming has direct and indirect effects on microbes associated with carbon cycling in northern lakes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Northern lakes disproportionately influence the global carbon cycle, and may do so more in the future depending on how their microbial communities respond to climate warming. Microbial communities can change because of the direct effects of climate warming on their metabolism and the indirect effects of climate warming on groundwater connectivity from thawing of surrounding permafrost, especially at lower landscape positions. Here we used shotgun metagenomics to compare the taxonomic and functional gene composition of sediment microbes in 19 peatland lakes across a 1600-km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada. We found microbes responded differently to the loss of regional permafrost cover than to increases in local groundwater connectivity. These results suggest that both the direct and indirect effects of climate warming, which were respectively associated with loss of permafrost and subsequent changes in groundwater connectivity interact to change microbial composition and function. Archaeal methanogens and genes involved in all major methanogenesis pathways were more abundant in warmer regions with less permafrost, but higher groundwater connectivity partly offset these effects. Bacterial community composition and methanotrophy genes did not vary with regional permafrost cover, and the latter changed similarly to methanogenesis with groundwater connectivity. Finally, we found an increase in sugar utilization genes in regions with less permafrost, which may further fuel methanogenesis. These results provide the microbial mechanism for observed increases in methane emissions associated with loss of permafrost cover in this region and suggest that future emissions will primarily be controlled by archaeal methanogens over methanotrophic bacteria as northern lakes warm. Our study more generally suggests that future predictions of aquatic carbon cycling will be improved by considering how climate warming exerts both direct effects associated with regional-scale permafrost thaw and indirect effects associated with local hydrology.

TI  - Simple model of morphometric constraint on carbon burial in boreal lakes
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>A geometric theory was developed to explain the empirical relationship between carbon burial and lake shape in boreal lakes. The key feature of this model is an attenuation length scale, analogous to models of marine organic carbon fluxes. This length scale is the ratio of how fast carbon is displaced vertically <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> how fast it is respired and engenders a simple model with a single easily constrained free parameter. Lake depths are modeled based on fractal area–volume relationships that reflect the approximate scale invariance of Earth’s topography on idealized lake geometries. Carbon burial is estimated by applying the attenuation length scale to these depths. Using this model, we demonstrate the relationship between the dynamic ratio—a metric of lake morphometry calculated by dividing the square root of surface area by the mean depth—and carbon burial. We use scaling relationships to predict how dynamic ratio, and by extension carbon burial, varies across the lake size spectrum. Our model also provides a basis for generalizing empirical studies to the biome scale. By applying our model to a boreal lake census, we estimate boreal lake carbon burial to be 1.8 <jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:inline-formula> 0.5 g C/m2/yr or 1.1 <jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:inline-formula> 0.3 Tg C/yr among all boreal lakes.</jats:p>

TI  - Effects of temporal abiotic drivers on the dynamics of an allometric trophic network model.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Current ecological research and ecosystem management call for improved understanding of the abiotic drivers of community dynamics, including temperature effects on species interactions and biomass accumulation. Allometric trophic network (ATN) models, which simulate material (carbon) transfer in trophic networks from producers to consumers based on mass-specific metabolic rates, provide an attractive framework to study consumer-resource interactions from organisms to ecosystems. However, the developed ATN models rarely consider temporal changes in some key abiotic drivers that affect, for example, consumer metabolism and producer growth. Here, we evaluate how temporal changes in carrying capacity and light-dependent growth rate of producers and in temperature-dependent mass-specific metabolic rate of consumers affect ATN model dynamics, namely seasonal biomass accumulation, productivity, and standing stock biomass of different trophic guilds, including age-structured fish communities. Our simulations of the pelagic Lake Constance food web indicated marked effects of temporally changing abiotic parameters on seasonal biomass accumulation of different guild groups, particularly among the lowest trophic levels (primary producers and invertebrates). While the adjustment of average irradiance had minor effect, increasing metabolic rate associated with 1-2°C temperature increase led to a marked decline of larval (0-year age) fish biomass, but to a substantial biomass increase of 2- and 3-year-old fish that were not predated by ≥4-year-old top predator fish, European perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>). However, when averaged across the 100 simulation years, the inclusion of seasonality in abiotic drivers caused only minor changes in standing stock biomasses and productivity of different trophic guilds. Our results demonstrate the potential of introducing seasonality in and adjusting the average values of abiotic ATN model parameters to simulate temporal fluctuations in food-web dynamics, which is an important step in ATN model development aiming to, for example, assess potential future community-level responses to ongoing environmental changes.

TI  - The several faces of fear: ecological consequences of predation risk in a lagoon model system As várias faces do medo: consequências ecológicas do risco de predação em um sistema modelo lagunar
PY  - 2013
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of predation risk on the occurrence of trophic cascades in a benthic food chain, and detect if the ecological consequences of predation risk can reverberate in patterns observed across different hierarchical scales, such as prey size, prey growth efficiency and nutrient recycling patterns. Methods: The model system used in the present experiment consisted of a simple linear food chain comprising a predator, a consumer and periphyton as basal resources. For 2 weeks, we manipulated predation risk using caged predators, incapable of killing their prey, across twelve outdoor mesocosms, simulating natural lagoon conditions. Results: Our results showed that predation risk can be responsible for the occurrence of a trophic cascade and the strength of the cascade is proportional to the intensity of risk. Predation risk can also negatively influence prey biomass and growth efficiency as well as affect nutrient recycling patterns by altering prey nutrient excretion rates. Through a simple mathematical formulation, we attempted to show that individual-level experimental results can be generalized to natural populations if evolutionary constraints to prey fitness can be reproduced in experimental conditions. Conclusions: Our results corroborate to integrate ecosystem dynamics with animal behavior, highlighting that not only bottom-up but also top-down mechanisms are responsible for determining ecosystem properties. We ultimately claim that prey adaptive foraging may serve to integrate ecosystem and evolutionary ecology, resulting in the development of a more robust and predictive theory of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - The impact of climate change and brownification on primary and bacterial production
PY  - 2014
AB  - Climatic condition is what ultimately frames all ecosystems and is now undergoing dramatic change. IPCC models predict, in 100 years, a temperature increase between 2-5 ˚C and, as a consequence of warmer and wetter conditions, increased humic content in northern temperate freshwater systems. To study the impact of increasing temperature and humic content on shallow freshwaters a long-term outdoor mesocosm experiment was performed. Five different treatments were used, where temperature and water colour was gradually increased simultaneously to correspond to a future scenario of 100 years. This resulted in +5 ˚C and 250% increase in absorbance (as a proxy for humic content) at the highest treatment compared to the control. No consistent significant difference in either primary or bacterial production between the treatments was observed. There was a steady increase of PP during spring and a tendency in total cumulative PP, summarized for the whole experimental period, until intermediate treatment effect. Further, a tendency for increasing heterotrophy was found during June and July. The condition of fish was highest at intermediate treatment effect. Several factors can possibly control PP and BP, such as nutrient limitation and predation as well as different stable states. Since increasing heterotrophy has been suggested, due to climate change, it is of great importance to further investigate the question of how the basal production will be affected and how this shapes freshwater systems, considering both ecosystem and societal values.

TI  - Hydrobiological characteristic of small lakes in northern Karelia during the ice-covered period
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The life of lakes in winter is still insufficiently studied. The purpose of this article is a comparative analysis of the quantitative development of planktonic and benthic communities and the abiotic conditions of their existence during the ice-covered period in two small (&lt;1 km2) northern lakes that differ greatly in morphometry and the degree of water humification. A significant difference was revealed in the seasonal dynamics of plankton communities in the studied lakes. In a deeper lake with water uncolored by humus, the quantitative development of phytoplankton at the end of the ice-covered period was almost as significant as during the open-water period. It is necessary to note the rapidity of changes in under-ice phytoplankton in early spring: in April 2020, the content of chlorophyll a in water changed more than six times during a week. There was no mass development of phytoplankton under the ice in a shallow highly humified lake. The zooplankton of the studied lakes was characterized by the opposite trend. In the deep-water lake, the winter zooplankton was noticeably inferior to the summer one in terms of the level of quantitative development; in the shallow lake, a high biomass (~1 g/m2) of zooplankton was noted throughout the entire study period. The macrozoobenthos of lakes in winter, on the whole, retained the same high level of quantitative development as in the open-water period. Seasonal differences were local and were caused by the redistribution of bottom animals due to changes in the oxygen and, possibly, temperature regime of bottom waters. In particular, due to hypoxic-anoxic conditions at the end of the ice-covered period, benthic animals migrated from the profundal zone of the deep-water lake. After the ice melted and the near-bottom waters were saturated with oxygen, the profundal community quickly recovered. Thus, the quantitative development of biological communities in winter can vary greatly even in closely located lakes, in particular, it depends on the degree of humification of the water body. Given the high dynamism of phytoplankton in early spring, the assessment of the role of the under-ice period in the life of lakes, apparently, requires long-term research, including detailed observations at the end of ice-covered period.</jats:p>

TI  - Brownification reduces oxygen gross primary production and community respiration and changes the phytoplankton community composition: An in situ mesocosm experiment with high‐frequency sensor measurements in a North Atlantic bay
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent decades, the increase in terrestrial inputs to freshwater and coastal ecosystems, especially occurring at northern latitudes, has led to a process of water color darkening known as “brownification.” To assess how brownification affects plankton community composition and functioning in northern coastal areas, an in situ mesocosm experiment using a highly colored humic substance to simulate a brownification event was performed in a North Atlantic bay (Hopavågen, Norway) in August 2019. Manual sampling for analyses of nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton pigments and zooplankton abundances was combined with high‐frequency (every 15 min) monitoring of key environmental variables to investigate the response of the plankton community in terms of oxygen metabolism and community composition. In response to brownification, the oxygen gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) slowed down significantly, by almost one‐third. However, GPP and R both decreased to the same extent; thus, the oxygen metabolic balance was not affected. Moreover, the chlorophyll‐<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentration significantly decreased under brownification, by 9% on average, and the chemotaxonomic pigment composition of the phytoplankton changed, indicating their acclimation to the reduced light availability. In addition, brownification seemed to favor appendicularians, the dominant mesozooplankton group in the mesocosms, which potentially contributed to lowering the phytoplankton biomass. In conclusion, the results of this in situ mesocosm experiment suggest that brownification could induce significant changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and significantly alter the overall oxygen metabolism of plankton communities in a northern Atlantic bay.</jats:p>

TI  - Role of forest ditching and agriculture on water quality: Connecting the long-term physico-chemical subsurface state of lakes with landscape and habitat structure information
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Increasing anthropogenic pressures have affected the status of surface freshwater ecosystems. Eutrophication, water browning, acidification, and several other processes may be channelled through the food web. In this study, we evaluate the role of hydrology impacting anthropogenic pressures, flows from urban, farmland and ditched forest areas, and how they explain the physico-chemical quality of lakes and ponds in the boreal biome of Finland. We study the long-term effect around 445 waterfowl survey sites that had physico-chemical measurements (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, water clarity and colour) produced by Finnish environmental authorities done in years 1986–2020. Furthermore, we investigate whether a long-term national-level citizen science study focusing on rather robust visible habitat structures measured by the volunteers can reveal physico-chemical water quality using data from >270 lakes where the waterfowl habitat survey and physico-chemical measurements could be spatio-temporally matched. Farmland occurrence around the lakes was positively associated with pH, colour and nutrient concentrations but negatively associated with water clarity. Furthermore, ditch length was positively associated with nitrogen concentration and water colour, while being negatively associated with pH and water clarity. Overall, the studied lakes showed a negative trend in nutrients and clarity but a positive trend in pH and colour. As expected, nutrient concentration increased and clarity decreased along the gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic lake habitat classifications, which suggests that the citizen science classification seem to reflect the subsurface physico-chemical status of the lakes. We conclude that farming and forest ditching practices in particular seem to associate with the state of the study lakes and that the ecological impacts of intensified turbidity and brownification in wetland ecosystems should be studied further in the future. Sustainable improvement of water quality rests upon scientific understanding of biogeochemical processes in lake ecosystems and the primary sources of the nutrient and sediment loading.

TI  - Controlling blooms of Planktothrix rubescens by optimized metalimnetic water withdrawal: a modelling study on adaptive reservoir operation
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Aggregations of cyanobacteria in lakes and reservoirs are commonly associated with surface blooms, but may also occur in the metalimnion as subsurface or deep chlorophyll maxima. Metalimnetic cyanobacteria blooms are of great concern when potentially toxic species, such as <jats:italic>Planktothrix rubescens,</jats:italic> are involved. Metalimnetic blooms of <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> have apparently increased in frequency and severity in recent years, so there is a strong need to identify reservoir management options to control it. We hypothesized that <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> blooms in reservoirs can be suppressed using selective withdrawal to maximize its export from the reservoir. We also expect that altering the light climate can affect the dynamics of this species. We tested our hypothesis in Rappbode Reservoir (the largest drinking water reservoir in Germany) by establishing a series of withdrawal and light scenarios based on a calibrated water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2).</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>The novel withdrawal strategy, in which water is withdrawn from a certain depth below the surface within the metalimnion instead of at a fixed elevation relative to the dam wall, significantly reduced <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> biomass in the reservoir. According to the simulation results, we defined an optimal withdrawal volume to control <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> blooms in the reservoir as approximately 10 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (10% of the reservoir volume) during its bloom phase. The results also illustrated that <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> growth can be most effectively suppressed if the metalimnetic withdrawal is applied in the early stage of its rapid growth, i.e., before the bloom occurs. In addition, our study showed that <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> biomass gradually decreased with increasing light extinction and nearly disappeared when the extinction coefficient exceeded 0.55 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title> <jats:p>Our study indicates the rise in <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> biomass can be effectively offset by selective withdrawal as well as by reducing light intensity beneath the water surface. Considering the widespread occurrence of <jats:italic>P. rubescens</jats:italic> in stratified lakes and reservoirs worldwide, we believe the results will be helpful for scientists and managers working on other water bodies to minimize the negative impacts of this harmful cyanobacteria.

TI  - Spatial predictors and temporal forecast of total organic carbon levels in boreal lakes.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Browning of Fennoscandian boreal lakes is raising concerns for negative ecosystem impacts as well as reduced drinking water quality. Declined sulfur deposition and warmer climate, along with afforestation, other climate impacts and less outfield grazing, have resulted in increased fluxes of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) from catchments to freshwater, and subsequently to coastal waters. This study assesses the major governing factors for increased TOC levels among several catchment characteristics in almost 5000 Fennoscandian lakes and catchments. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy for plant biomass, and the proportions of peatland in the catchment, along with surface runoff intensity and nitrogen deposition loading, were identified as the main spatial predictors for lake TOC concentrations. A multiple linear model, based on these explanatory variables, was used to simulate future TOC concentration in surface runoff from coastal drainage basins in 2050 and 2100, using the forecasts of climatic variables in two of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP): 1-2.6 (+2 °C) and 3-7.0 (+4,5 °C). These scenarios yield contrasting effects. SSP 1-2.6 predicts an overall decrease of TOC export to coastal waters, while SSP 3-7.0 in contrast leads to an increase in TOC export.

TI  - Phytoplankton traits predict ecosystem function in a global set of lakes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Predicting ecosystem function from environmental conditions is a central goal of ecosystem ecology. However, many traditional ecosystem models are tailored for specific regions or ecosystem types, requiring several regional models to predict the same function. Alternatively, trait-based approaches have been effectively used to predict community structure in both terrestrial and aquatic environments and ecosystem function in a limited number of terrestrial examples. Here, we test the efficacy of a trait-based model in predicting gross primary production (GPP) in lake ecosystems. We incorporated data from >1000 United States lakes along with laboratory-generated phytoplankton trait data to build a trait-based model of GPP and then validated the model with GPP observations from a separate set of globally distributed lakes. The trait-based model performed as well as or outperformed two ecosystem models both spatially and temporally, demonstrating the efficacy of trait-based models for predicting ecosystem function over a range of environmental conditions.

TI  - Shoring up the foundations of production to respiration ratios in lakes
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ratio of primary production to ecosystem respiration rates (P:R ratio) is an ostensibly simple calculation that is used to characterize lake function, including trophic status, the incorporation of terrestrial organic carbon into lacustrian food webs, and the direction of carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) flux between a lake and the atmosphere. However, many predictive links between P:R ratios and lake ecosystem function stem from a historically plankton‐centric perspective and the common use of the diel oxygen curve approach. We review the evolution of the use of P:R ratios and examine common assumptions underlying their application to (1) eutrophication, (2) carbon flux through lake food webs, and (3) the role of lakes in the global carbon budget. Foundational P:R studies have been complicated principally by the following: most P:R ratios were calculated from mid‐lake measurements and failed to incorporate nonplanktonic dynamics; there has been confusion regarding the food web implications when P:R ≠ 1; and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes between lakes and the atmosphere are influenced by nonmetabolic processes. We argue for a re‐assessment, or shoring up, of several fundamental assumptions that continue to guide metabolism research in lakes by accounting for mixing, benthic‐littoral processes, groundwater fluxes, and abiotic controls on gas dynamics to better understand lake food webs and accurately integrate lake ecosystems into landscape‐scale carbon cycling models.</jats:p>

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon in streams within a subarctic catchment analysed using a GIS/remote sensing approach
PY  - 2018
AB  - Climate change projections show that temperature and precipitation increases can alter the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and high latitude landscapes, including their freshwaters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, but the impact of catchment productivity on DOC release to subarctic waters remains poorly known, especially at regional scales. We test the hypothesis that increased terrestrial productivity, as indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), generates higher stream DOC concentrations in the Stordalen catchment in subarctic Sweden. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the degree to which other generic catchment properties (elevation, slope) explain DOC concentration, and whether or not land cover variables representing the local vegetation type (e.g., mire, forest) need to be included to obtain adequate predictive models for DOC delivered into rivers. We show that the land cover type, especially the proportion of mire, played a dominant role in the catchment’s release of DOC, while NDVI, slope, and elevation were supporting predictor variables. The NDVI as a single predictor showed weak and inconsistent relationships to DOC concentrations in recipient waters, yet NDVI was a significant positive regulator of DOC in multiple regression models that included land cover variables. Our study illustrates that vegetation type exerts primary control in DOC regulation in Stordalen, while productivity (NDVI) is of secondary importance. Thus, predictive multiple linear regression models for DOC can be utilized combining these different types of explanatory variables.

TI  - Morphology captures function in phytoplankton: a large-scale analysis of phytoplankton communities in relation to their environment.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Het modelleren van de dynamiek van fytoplanktongemeenschappen is een geweldige uitdagende taak want het betreft zo enorm veel verschillende soorten en een heel scala aan combinaties van potentieel conditionerende omgevingsfactoren. Daarnaast lijkt het geven van gedetailleerde voorspellingen fundamenteel onmogelijk, zelfs met volledige kennis van alle aspecten van de biologie van de soorten. Voor het in kaart brengen van de effecten van veranderingen in de omgevingsfactoren op het fytoplankton kan daarom kan niet volstaan worden met alleen biomassa, maar zullen kenmerken van de samenstelling van de gemeenschap betrokken moeten worden. Dit proefschrift richt zich op de vraag of fytoplanktonsoorten geclusterd kunnen worden in homogene, functionele groepen die beter voorspelbaar zijn uit omgevingsfactoren dan individuele soorten.Predicting phytoplankton community dynamics in detail seems an overwhelming task as there are so many species, and a myriad of combinations of potential conditioning factors. Furthermore, even with full knowledge of all aspects of species biology intrinsic chaos in communities may make detailed prediction fundamentally impossible. Aggregated estimators of phytoplankton communities may work to predict overall community responses to varying environmental conditions. However, phytoplankton species differ strongly in their effect on ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. Therefore, it is important to consider community composition rather than just biomass. This thesis focuses on the question whether species might be clustered in groups that are reasonably homogeneous in a functional sense, and might be better predictable from environmental conditions than individual species. To answer this question we first explored the factors that affect richness and biomass at the species level and then evaluated how well trait-based groups of species capture function and may be predicted from environmental conditions. We used a large data base including more than 700 species from 200 lakes in different climate zones and continents.

TI  - Nitrogen Removal from Eutrophicated Water by Aquatic Plants
PY  - 2010
AB  - Increased N concentration in an aquatic ecosystem is one of important causes of eutrophication. Aquatic higher plants in eutrophic water bodies can remove N by direct uptake and by being a carbon source and a surface substrate for microorganisms and algae, which also use N as a nutrient and can transform N into gaseous forms that escape from the ecosystem. Rooted submerged higher plants can transport oxygen to inundated soils, which increases microbial nitrification, thus providing NO3 – to the water column. Factors influencing N removal efficiency by aquatic plants include N and hydraulic loading, light, temperature, pH, season, plant harvesting, and availability of other nutrients. These factors differ for different plant species, therefore, plant selection for a particular wastewater treatment should be considered in an integrated approach.

TI  - Browning of freshwaters: Consequences to ecosystem services, underlying drivers, and potential mitigation measures
PY  - 2019
AB  - Browning of surface waters, as a result of increasing dissolved organic carbon and iron concentrations, is a widespread phenomenon with implications to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of browning in relation to ecosystem services, outline what the underlying drivers and mechanisms of browning are, and specifically focus on exploring potential mitigation measures to locally counteract browning. These topical concepts are discussed with a focus on Scandinavia, but are of relevance also to other regions. Browning is of environmental concern as it leads to, e.g., increasing costs and risks for drinking water production, and reduced fish production in lakes by limiting light penetration. While climate change, recovery from acidification, and land-use change are all likely factors contributing to the observed browning, managing the land use in the hydrologically connected parts of the landscape may be the most feasible way to counteract browning of natural waters.

TI  - Drivers of interannual and intra-annual variability of dissolved organic carbon concentration in the River Thames between 1884 and 2013
PY  - 2019
AB  - The World's longest record of river water quality (River Thames – 130 years) provides a unique opportunity to understand fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations dynamics. Understanding riverine DOC variability through long‐term studies is crucial to capture patterns and drivers influencing sources of DOC at scales relevant for decision making. The Thames basin (UK) has undergone massive land‐use change, as well as increased urbanisation and population during the period considered. We aimed to investigate the drivers of intra‐annual to interannual DOC variability, assess the variability due to natural and anthropogenic factors, and understand the causes for the increased DOC variability over the period. Two approaches were used to achieve these aims. The first method was singular spectrum analysis, which was used to reconstruct the major oscillatory modes of DOC, hydroclimatic variables and atmospheric circulation patterns, and to visualise the interaction between these variables. The second approach used was generalized additive modelling, which was used to investigate other non‐natural drivers of DOC variability. Our study shows that DOC variability increased by 80% over the data period, with the greatest increase occurring from the beginning of World War II onward. The primary driver of the increase in DOC variability was the increase in the average value of fluvial DOC over the period of record, which was itself linked to the increase in basin population and diffuse DOC sources to the river due to land‐use and land‐management changes. Seasonal DOC variability was linked to streamflow and temperature. Our study allows to identify drivers of fluvial intra‐annual and interannual DOC variability, and therefore empowers actions to reduce high DOC concentrations.

TI  - An operational framework for the advancement of a molecule-to-biosphere stoichiometry theory
PY  - 2017
AB  - Biological stoichiometry is an approach that focuses on the balance of elements in biological interactions. It is a theory that has the potential to causally link material processes at all biological levels – from molecules to the biosphere. But the lack of a coherent operational framework has so far restricted progress in this direction. Here, we provide a framework to help infer how a stoichiometric imbalance observed at one level impacts all other biological levels. Our framework enables us to high the areas of the theory in need of completion, development and integration at all biological levels. Our hope is that this framework will contribute to the building of a more predictive theory of elemental transfers within the biosphere, and thus, to a better understanding of human-induced perturbations to the global biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Terrestrial discharges mediate trophic shifts and enhance methylmercury accumulation in estuarine biota
PY  - 2017
AB  - The input of mercury (Hg) to ecosystems is estimated to have increased two- to fivefold during the industrial era, and Hg accumulates in aquatic biota as neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg). Escalating anthropogenic land use and climate change are expected to alter the input rates of terrestrial natural organic matter (NOM) and nutrients to aquatic ecosystems. For example, climate change has been projected to induce 10 to 50% runoff increases for large coastal regions globally. A major knowledge gap is the potential effects on MeHg exposure to biota following these ecosystem changes. We monitored the fate of five enriched Hg isotope tracers added to mesocosm scale estuarine model ecosystems subjected to varying loading rates of nutrients and terrestrial NOM. We demonstrate that increased terrestrial NOM input to the pelagic zone can enhance the MeHg bioaccumulation factor in zooplankton by a factor of 2 to 7 by inducing a shift in the pelagic food web from autotrophic to heterotrophic. The terrestrial NOM input also enhanced the retention of MeHg in the water column by up to a factor of 2, resulting in further increased MeHg exposure to pelagic biota. Using mercury mass balance calculations, we predict that MeHg concentration in zooplankton can increase by a factor of 3 to 6 in coastal areas following scenarios with 15 to 30% increased terrestrial runoff. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the impact of climate-induced changes in food web structure on MeHg bioaccumulation in future biogeochemical cycling models and risk assessments of Hg.

TI  - The Absorption of Light in Lakes: Negative Impact of Dissolved Organic Carbon on Primary Productivity
PY  - 2014
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbs a substantial fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in boreal lakes. However, few studies have systematically estimated how this light absorption influences pelagic primary productivity. In this study, 75 boreal lakes spanning wide and orthogonal gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) were sampled during a synoptic survey. We measured absorption spectra of phytoplankton pigments, CDOM, and non-algal particles to quantify the vertical fate of photons in the PAR region. Area-specific rates of gross primary productivity (PPA) were estimated using a bio-optical approach based on phytoplankton in vivo light absorption and the light-dependent quantum yield of photochemistry in PSII measured by a PAM fluorometer. Subsequently, we calculated the effects of CDOM, DOC, and TP concentration on PPA. CDOM absorbed the largest fraction of PAR in the majority of lakes (mean 56.3%, range 36.9–76.2%), phytoplankton pigments captured a comparatively minor fraction (mean 6.6%, range 2.2–28.2%). PPA estimates spanned from 45 to 993 mg C m−2 day−1 (median 286 mg C m−2 day−1). We found contrasting effects of CDOM (negative) and TP (positive) on PPA. The use of DOC or CDOM as predictors gave very similar results and the negative effect of these variables on PPA can probably be attributed to shading. A future scenario of increased DOC, which is highly correlated with CDOM in these lakes, might impose negative effects on areal primary productivity in boreal lakes.

TI  - Holocene lake phosphorus species and primary producers reflect catchment processes in a small, temperate lake
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paleolimnological study aims to investigate how natural processes and anthropogenic land‐use changes have affected sedimentary phosphorus (P) forms and primary producers in a small, temperate lake (Lake Fuglsø, Denmark) throughout the Holocene. Our multi‐proxy approach uses pollen, X‐ray fluorescence scanning, carbon (C) and nitrogen contents and stable isotopes, sequential P extraction, <jats:sup>31</jats:sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, pigments, diatoms, and plant macrofossils from a <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C‐dated sediment record. We found three periods of human impact: (1) low disturbance from domestic grazing during the early/mid Neolithic (~3600 to ~2600 BC), (2) higher disturbance because of animal husbandry and some grain cultivation during the Late Bronze and Pre‐Roman Iron Age (~800 BC to AD ~100), and (3) strong disturbance caused by domestic grazing, intensified crop cultivation and, in particular, by retting of fiber plants during the Middle Ages and Renaissance (AD ~1000 to ~1700). Cultural eutrophication during the latter phase caused unprecedented changes in the lake, including altered species composition, high production, and strongly accelerated sediment accumulation rates. Generally, catchment deforestation was related to elevated proportions of metal (iron, aluminum, calcium)‐bound P forms in the sediment, while high tree cover correlated with elevated proportions of P forms associated with organic material (“organic” P, humic‐bound P, refractory organic P) and loosely bound P. During phases with forest in the catchment, silicon (Si) inputs to the lake were insufficient and diatom frustules were mostly absent in the sediments. In contrast, diatoms thrived in the lake when the landscape was open and erosional Si influx was high. This study is the first to show long‐term (~eight millennia) and recurring Si limitation of diatoms, a finding that may explain the absence of diatoms in sediment records of other sites too. In summary, human land‐use with preceding deforestation accelerated the transport of nutrients and elements from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment, leading to substantial and irreversible changes in Lake Fuglsø. Our study is a good example of the tight links between catchment processes and lake status, indicating that catchment dynamics should be considered in lake restoration projects, particularly for lowland lakes with high catchment : lake area ratios.</jats:p>

TI  - Climate change predicted to cause severe increase of organic carbon in lakes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Riverine transport of organic carbon (OC) to the ocean is a significant component in the global carbon (C) cycle and the concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in rivers and lakes is vital for ecosystem properties and water quality for human use. By use of a large dataset comprising chemical variables and detailed catchment information in ~1000 Norwegian pristine lakes covering a wide climatic range, we were able to predict TOC concentrations with high accuracy. We further predict, using a 'space-for-time' approach and a downscaled, moderate, climate change scenario, that northern, boreal regions likely will experience strong increases in OC export from catchments to surface waters. Median concentrations of OC in these lakes will increase by 65%, from the current median of 2.0-3.3 mg C L -1 . This is a long-term effect, primarily mediated by increased terrestrial vegetation cover in response to climate change. This increase OC will have severe impacts on food-webs, productivity and human use. Given the robustness of the estimates and the general applicability of the parameters, we suggest that these findings would be relevant to boreal areas in general.

TI  - Unimodal response of fish yield to dissolved organic carbon
PY  - 2013
AB  - Here, we demonstrate a contrasting effect of terrestrial coloured dissolved organic material on the secondary production of boreal nutrient poor lakes. Using fish yield from standardised brown trout gill-net catches as a proxy, we show a unimodal response of lake secondary productivity to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This suggests a trade-off between positive and negative effects, where the initial increase may hinge upon several factors such as energy subsidising, screening of UV-radiation or P and N load being associated with organic carbon. The subsequent decline in production with further increase in DOC is likely associated with light limitations of primary production. We also show that shallow lakes switch from positive to negative effects at higher carbon loads than deeper lakes. These results underpin the major role of organic carbon for structuring productivity of boreal lake ecosystems.

TI  - A unified framework for herbivore-to-producer biomass ratio reveals the relative influence of four ecological factors
PY  - 2021
AB  - The biomass ratio of herbivores to primary producers reflects the structure of a community. Four primary factors have been proposed to affect this ratio, including production rate, defense traits and nutrient contents of producers, and predation by carnivores. However, identifying the joint effects of these factors across natural communities has been elusive, in part because of the lack of a framework for examining their effects simultaneously. Here, we develop a framework based on Lotka–Volterra equations for examining the effects of these factors on the biomass ratio. We then utilize it to test if these factors simultaneously affect the biomass ratio of freshwater plankton communities. We found that all four factors contributed significantly to the biomass ratio, with carnivore abundance having the greatest effect, followed by producer stoichiometric nutrient content. Thus, the present framework should be useful for examining the multiple factors shaping various types of communities, both aquatic and terrestrial. Takehiro Kazama et al. develop a framework based on Lotka–Volterra models to identify the relative influences of production rate, defense traits, nutrient contents of producers, and predation, in affecting the biomass ratio of herbivores to primary producers in a community. They apply this framework to freshwater plankton systems and find that while all factors affect the biomass ratio, carnivore abundance has the greatest relative influence.

TI  - Influence of littoral periphyton on whole-lake metabolism relates to littoral vegetation in humic lakes
PY  - 2017
AB  - The role of littoral habitats in lake metabolism has been underrated, especially in humic lakes, based on an assumption of low benthic primary production (PP) due to low light penetration into water. This assumption has been challenged by recent recognition of littoral epiphyton dominance of whole-lake PP in a small highly humic lake and of epiphyton as an important basal food source for humic lake biota. However, as these studies have mostly concerned single lakes, there is a need to test their wider generality. We studied the whole-lake PP and community respiration (CR) in eight small humic lakes in southern Finland during July 2015 using 14 C incorporation to measure pelagic PP and the changes in dissolved inorganic carbon in light and dark in situ incubations to measure CR and littoral PP by epiphyton. Changes in O2 concentration in both pelagic and littoral surface water were measured periodically from each lake and, additionally, continuously with a data logger from one lake during the study period. The results revealed that the littoral dominated whole-lake net primary production (NPP) in five of the eight lakes, which was supported by observed O2 supersaturation in the littoral surface water in most of the lakes. Calculated pelagic:littoral ratios by area correlated negatively with both littoral NPP and littoral contribution to whole-lake NPP. Moreover, there was a significant positive relationship between littoral proportion of whole-lake NPP and the fraction of lake surface area covered by littoral aquatic vegetation. This demonstrates that increased aquatic littoral vegetation cover increases the overall importance of the littoral to whole-lake PP in highly humic lakes. Littoral NPP also correlated strongly with littoral O2 saturation, and the continuously measured O2 revealed substantial temporal variation in O2 saturation, particularly in the littoral zone. Whole-lake gross primary production:community respiration (GPP:CR) ratios revealed that accounting for littoral metabolism produced a marked shift towards lake metabolic balance, although all the eight lakes remained net heterotrophic. This study emphasizes that littoral metabolism needs to be accounted for when estimating whole-lake C fluxes in all lakes, even in highly colored humic waters.

TI  - Application of the Beer–Lambert Model to Attenuation of Photosynthetically Active Radiation in a Shallow, Eutrophic Lake
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Models of primary production in aquatic systems must include a means to estimate subsurface light. Such models often use the Beer–Lambert law, assuming exponential attenuation of light with depth. It is further assumed that the diffuse attenuation coefficient may be estimated as a summation of scattering/absorbing constituent concentrations multiplied by their respective specific attenuation coefficients. While theoretical deviations from these assumptions have been documented, it is useful to consider the empirical performance of this common approach. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels and water quality conditions were recorded weekly from six to eight monitoring stations in western Lake Erie between 2012 and 2016. Exponential PAR extinction models yielded a mean attenuation coefficient of 1.55 m (interquartile range = 0.74–1.90 m). While more complex light attenuation models are available, analysis of residuals indicated that the simple Beer–Lambert model is adequate for shallow, eutrophic waters similar to western Lake Erie (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> &gt; 0.9 for 96% of samples). Three groups of water quality variables were predictive of PAR attenuation: total and nonvolatile suspended particles, dissolved organic substances (dissolved organic carbon and chromophoric dissolved organic matter), and organic solids (volatile suspended solids and chlorophyll). Multiple regression models using these variables predicted 3–90% of the variability in PAR attenuation, with a median adjusted <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.86. Explanatory variables within these groups may substitute for each other while maintaining similar model performance, indicating that various combinations of water quality variables may be useful to predict PAR attenuation, depending on availability within a model framework or monitoring program.</jats:p>

TI  - Eutrophication drives divergent water clarity responses to decadal variation in lake level
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title><jats:italic>Abstract</jats:italic></jats:title><jats:p>Water clarity is an important attribute of lakes, but climatic effects on clarity remain obscure, because lake physical and chemical conditions generate complex responses. Here, we examine how hydrologic variation influences water clarity (Secchi depth) over 30 yr across 24 lakes in northwest Wisconsin (U.S.A.) along a gradient in lake phosphorus (P) concentration and lake attributes (e.g., depth, area, land use, and trophic status). We took a multivariate time‐series approach to explore shared temporal patterns in Secchi depth among lakes and to evaluate the relative strength of hydrological time‐series (lake level, Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI], and antecedent precipitation) as a component of water clarity change. Decadal fluctuations in lake level best explain annual shifts in water clarity, but not precipitation or PDSI. The sign and magnitude of the response varies among lakes by trophic status. Oligotrophic lakes become clearer when lake levels decline, and more turbid when lake levels rise, presumably due to increased watershed loading of dissolved organic matter and nutrients. Dilution and stronger stratification during wet years may drive the opposite response observed in eutrophic lakes, which become clearer in wet years and more turbid during drought. Overall, the water clarity response to lake level increased with P concentration and was more positive in shallow polymictic vs. dimictic lakes. Although further study is required, we suggest that trophic status and lake mixis mediate water clarity's response to lake level fluctuations. We propose that eutrophication not only changes mean lake clarity but also the natural relationship of water clarity to hydrology.</jats:p>

TI  - Do anthropogenic hydrological alterations in shallow lakes affect the dynamics of plankton
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Anthropogenic and natural climate-impacted water level (WL) fluctuations are one of many environmental problems affecting natural ecosystems. The aim of this study was to explain differences in the development of autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton in two shallow, temperate, embanked lakes with different modes of WL regulation. Lake Mytycze has natural WL changes supplied exclusively by precipitation; a decrease in water level was predominantly due to more evaporation than precipitation. In this lake, nutrient concentration, particulate matter, growth of toxigenic cyanobacteria and contamination with microcystins correlated positively with decreases in WL. Lake Tomaszne has anthropogenic WL regulation, elevated values of nutrients and particulate matter, but they were caused by the periodic, abrupt entrance of river waters rich in allochthonous nutrients, organic and inorganic particles. In this lake, a higher biomass of cyanobacteria was observed than in the lake with natural WL changes; the concentrations of intracellular microcystins in water correlated positively with the biomass of toxigenic species. In both lakes, decreases in the biomass of algivorous crustaceans correlated with the occurrence of cyanobacterial biomass. Biomasses of algivorous crustaceans increased abruptly when concentration of microcystins diminished below 2 μg∙dm−3. These biomass peaks occurred due to rapid development of the cladocerans; Bosmina longirostris was found in the lake with natural WL changes and Daphnia cucullata was found in the lake with anthropogenic WL regulation. The development of predacious crustaceans was not related to the blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria or the biomass of algivorous crustaceans (as potential prey). In both lakes, Thermocyclops crassus and Mesocyclops leuckartii (Copepoda) contributed significantly to the biomass of predacious crustaceans; their abundance correlated positively with the amount of particulate matter, which was probably utilised as an alternative food source. These findings illustrate indirect influence of WL on plankton composition and biomass through alteration of environmental variables. The results indicate that the mode of WL regulation (natural vs anthropogenic) must be taken into consideration when estimating the influence of WL changes on plankton dynamics.

TI  - Microbial degradation of terrigenous dissolved organic matter and potential consequences for carbon cycling in brown-water streams
PY  - 2014
AB  - Streams receive substantial terrestrial deliveries of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The chromophoric (CDOM) fraction of terrestrial deliveries confers the brown colour to streamwater, often understood as browning, and plays a central role in aquatic photochemistry and is generally considered resistant to microbial metabolism. To assess the relevance of terrigenous DOM for carbon fluxes mediated by stream microorganisms, we determined the bioavailable fraction of DOM and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), and related these measures to partial pressure of CO2 in headwater streams spanning across a browning gradient. Fluorescence and absorbance analyses revealed high molecular weight and aromaticity, and elevated contributions from humic-like components to characterize terrestrial CDOM. We found that microorganisms metabolized this material at the cost of low CUE and shifted its composition (from fluorescence and absorbance) towards less aromatic and low-molecular weight compounds. Respiration (from CUE) was related to CO2 supersaturation in streams and this relationship was modulated by DOM composition. Our findings imply that terrigenous DOM is respired by microorganisms rather than incorporated into their biomass, and that this channelizes terrigenous carbon to the pool of CO2 potentially outgassing from streams into the atmosphere. This finding may gain relevance as major terrigenous carbon stores become mobilized and browning progresses.

TI  - Change in winter climate will affect dissolved organic carbon and water fluxes in mid‐to‐high latitude catchments
PY  - 2013
AB  - There is a growing awareness that mid-to-high latitude regions will be strongly affected by climate change. These changes are predicted to be especially pronounced during winter, particularly at higher latitudes. To test how water quality in northern catchments could be affected by warmer winter climates, we assembled long-term data from eight well-studied catchments in Sweden, Scotland, Canada and the USA across a climatic gradient spanning from 2 to +9 degrees C in mean annual temperature and between 11.6 and +6.1 degrees C in average winter temperature. We used the climatic gradient combined with inter-annual variability among catchments to examine how warmer winters could affect the seasonality (seasonal timing) and synchroneity (coupling) of water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes. In general, sites with colder winters (less than 5 degrees C) experienced an export concentrated in spring, whereas sites with warmer winters (>0 degrees C) displayed a more evenly distributed export across all seasons. Catchments with warmer winters also displayed less synchroneity between water and DOC flux during winter compared with colder sites, whereas the opposite was found for the spring. Patterns from the climatic gradient were supported by inter-annual variability at individual sites where both seasonality and synchroneity in the spring were related to the temperature during the preceding winter. Our findings suggest that one likely consequence of warmer winters in northern regions is that the proportion of the annual DOC and water export will increase during winter and decrease during spring and summer. This is of importance as it is the latter seasons during which downstream utilization of both water and DOC often is largest. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Shifting limitation of primary production: experimental support for a new model in lake ecosystems.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The limits on primary production vary in complex ways across space and time. Strong tests of clear conceptual models have been instrumental in understanding these patterns in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we present the first experimental test of a new model describing how shifts from nutrient to light limitation control primary productivity in lake ecosystems as hydrological inputs of nutrients and organic matter vary. We found support for two key predictions of the model: that gross primary production (GPP) follows a hump-shaped relationship with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations; and that the maximum GPP, and the critical DOC concentration at which the hump occurs, are determined by the stoichiometry and chromophoricity of the hydrological inputs. Our results advance fundamental understanding of the limits on aquatic primary production, and have important applications given ongoing anthropogenic alterations of the nutrient and organic matter inputs to surface waters.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition on Remote Freshwater Ecosystems
PY  - 2012
AB  - We review known and hypothesized effects of nitrogen (N) deposition owing to human activities on the chemistry, organisms, and ecosystem processes of remote oligotrophic freshwaters. Acidification is the best-known effect of N deposition on water chemistry, but additional effects include increased nutrient availability and alteration of the balance between N and other nutrients. Our synthesis of the literature, framed in a comprehensive model for the effects of N deposition on natural ecosystems, shows that all these effects can reduce biological diversity and alter ecosystem processes in remote freshwaters. N deposition is projected to grow worldwide in the near future and will interact with other global changes. Present effects on these fragile ecosystems may be only early signs of more radical impacts ahead.

TI  - Contrasting impacts of warming and browning on periphyton
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We tested interactive effects of warming (+2°C) and browning on periphyton accrual and pigment composition when grown on a synthetic substrate (plastic strips) in the euphotic zone of 16 experimental ponds. We found that increased colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) and associated nutrients alone, or in combination with warming, resulted in a substantially enhanced biomass accrual of periphyton, and a comparatively smaller increase in phytoplankton. This illustrates that periphyton is capable of using nutrients associated with cDOM, and by this may affect nutrient availability for phytoplankton. However, warming weakened the positive impact of browning on periphyton accrual, possibly by thermal compensation inferred from altered pigment composition, and/or changes in community composition. Our results illustrate multiple impacts of climate change on algal growth, which could have implications for productivity and consumer resource use, especially in shallow areas in northern lakes.</jats:p>

TI  - The Biodiversity and Metabolism of Peatland Pools
PY  - 2015
AB  - Knowledge of the ecology and ecosystem functioning of pools created by the peatland restoration method of drain-blocking is limited. This thesis provides the most comprehensive study of these peatland pool ecosystems to date. Data were collected to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate communities in both drain-blocked and naturally-occurring pools on areas of blanket bog in northern England. Corresponding environmental data were analysed to identify any mechanisms underpinning biodiversity metrics. The metabolism (i.e. rates of photosynthesis and respiration) of drain-blocked pools was estimated using the diel dissolved oxygen (DO) method. Drain-blocked pools were found to house macroinvertebrate communities similar to those in natural pools, including taxa characteristic of acid-mire pool habitats, thus providing suitable habitat for peatland aquatic taxa. There was some evidence that pools in reprofiled drains were more biodiverse than L-shaped pools. New pools were colonised quickly with taxon richness peaking in pools aged five to eight years, and pools aged 15 years housing some fauna not found in younger pools. Results suggested that gamma diversity would be best encouraged by creating a range of pool sizes with diverse vegetation composition. Drain-blocked pools were found to be strongly heterotrophic, with high rates of respiration driven by elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon and the relatively large sediment-water interface. Water temperature and DO profiles obtained from pools in England, Scotland and Sweden revealed severe diurnal stratification regimes, with implications for sampling methodologies, gas fluxes and carbon cycling. This research will help to inform future drain-blocking schemes and also has relevance for studies analysing the biogeochemistry and biota of other shallow waterbodies.

TI  - Long-term trends and synchrony in dissolved organic matter characteristics in Wisconsin, USA, lakes: Quality, not quantity, is highly sensitive to climate
PY  - 2017
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a fundamental driver of many lake processes. In the past several decades, many lakes have exhibited a substantial increase in DOM quantity, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. While increasing DOC is now widely recognized, fewer studies have sought to understand how characteristics of DOM (DOM quality) change over time. Quality can be measured in several ways, including the optical characteristics spectral slope (S275–295), spectral ratio (SR), absorbance at 254 nm (A254), and DOC-specific absorbance (SUVA; A254:DOC). However, long-term measurements of quality are not nearly as common as long-term measurements of DOC concentration. We used 24 years of DOC and absorbance data for seven lakes in the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research site in northern Wisconsin, USA, to examine temporal trends and synchrony in both DOC concentration and quality. We predicted lower SR and S275–295 and higher A254 and SUVA trends, consistent with increasing DOC and greater allochthony. DOC concentration exhibited both significant positive and negative trends among lakes. In contrast, DOC quality exhibited trends suggesting reduced allochthony or increased degradation, with significant long-term increases in SR in three lakes. Patterns and synchrony of DOM quality parameters suggest that they are more responsive to climatic variations than DOC concentration. SUVA was particularly responsive to the degree of soil moisture. These results demonstrate that DOC quantity and quality can exhibit different complex long-term trends and responses to climatic drivers, with implications for carbon cycling and microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Global patterns of light saturation and photoinhibition of lake primary production
PY  - 2016
AB  - The effect of light availability on lake gross primary production (GPP) depends on the physical setting and meteorological and chemical conditions characterizing the lake. Although it has long been recognized that complex interactions between external and in-lake conditions affect whole-lake GPP, few studies have evaluated the importance of different drivers of daily and seasonal variability in GPP for a diverse set of lake types. In this study, we used a unique dataset covering a wide spectrum of lakes in terms of size, nutrient loading, and phytoplankton biomass, combined with high-frequency meteorology, dissolved oxygen (DO), and light data to determine the GPP of the lakes and to investigate the degree of light limitation and photoinhibition of GPP over multiple time scales. A Bayesian modeling approach was employed to model diel changes in DO as a nonlinear function of light and temperature, making it possible to determine the parameters describing the light dependency of hourly GPP rates under in situ conditions. Of the 900 days analyzed, 43% had moderate to strongly light-saturated GPP during midday summer conditions, and photoinhibition occurred on 77% of these days. GPP became increasingly light-limited with increasing nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations, conditions that also reduced the likelihood of photoinhibition. The highest summer rates of GPP were found in the light-limited, nonphotoinhibited lakes with elevated nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass, although annual rates were much lower in these systems. Our results show that the interaction of light and nutrients affects the magnitude and temporal variability of GPP in lake ecosystems

TI  - Development of photosynthetic carbon fixation model using multi-excitation wavelength fast repetition rate fluorometry in Lake Biwa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Direct measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the water column are essential, but can be spatially and temporally restrictive. Fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf) is a bio-optical technique based on chlorophyll a (Chl-a) fluorescence that can estimate the electron transport rate (ETRPSII) at photosystem II (PSII) of phytoplankton in real time. However, derivation of phytoplankton GPP in carbon units from ETRPSII remains challenging because the electron requirement for carbon fixation (Фe,C) can vary depending on multiple factors. Also, the FRRf is still relatively novel, especially in freshwater ecosystems where phosphorus limitation and cyanobacterial blooms are common. The goal of the present study is to construct a robust Фe,C model for freshwater ecosystems using simultaneous measurements of ETRPSII by FRRf with multi-excitation wavelengths coupled with traditional carbon fixation rate by the 13C method. The study was conducted in oligotrophic and mesotrophic areas in Lake Biwa from July 2018 to May 2019. The combination of excitation light at 444, 512 and 633 nm correctly estimated ETRPSII of cyanobacteria. The range of Фe,C in the phytoplankton community varied from 1.1 to 31.0 mol e− mol C−1 during the study period. Generalized liner model showed the best model including 12 physicochemical and biological factors explained 67% of the variance in Фe,C. Among all factors, water temperature was the most significant, while PAR intensity was not. The GPP values estimated by FRRf (GPPf) with the best Фe,C model relative to 13C (GPP13C) varied 0.5–1.5. Further, GPPf estimated with more parsimonious Фe,C models were also comparable to GPP13C. This study quantifies the applicability of the in situ FRRf methodology, and supports continuous monitoring of GPP by FRRf in lakes with large spatio-temporal variability of environmental conditions and phytoplankton assemblages.

TI  - Life history constraints explain negative relationship between fish productivity and dissolved organic carbon in lakes.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Resource availability constrains the life history strategies available to organisms and may thereby limit population growth rates and productivity. We used this conceptual framework to explore the mechanisms driving recently reported negative relationships between fish productivity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in lakes. We studied populations of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in a set of lakes with DOC concentrations ranging from 3 to 24 mg/L; previous work has demonstrated that primary and secondary productivity of food webs is negatively related to DOC concentration across this gradient. For each population, we quantified individual growth rate, age at maturity, age-specific fecundity, maximum age, length-weight and length-egg size relationships, and other life history characteristics. We observed a strong negative relationship between maximum size and DOC concentration; for instance, fish reached masses of 150 to 260 g in low-DOC lakes but <120 g in high-DOC lakes. Relationships between fecundity and length, and between egg size and length, were constant across the DOC gradient. Because fish in high-DOC lakes reached smaller sizes but had similar fecundity and egg size at a given size, their total lifetime fecundity was as much as two orders of magnitude lower than fish in low-DOC lakes. High DOC concentrations appeared to constrain the range of bluegill life history strategies available; populations in high-DOC lakes always had low initial growth rates and high ages at maturity, whereas populations in low-DOC showed higher variability in these traits. This was also the case for the intrinsic rates of natural increase of these populations, which were always low at the high end of the DOC gradient. The potentially lower capacity for fish populations in high-DOC lakes to recover from exploitation has clear implications for the sustainable management of recreational fisheries in the face of considerable spatial heterogeneity and ongoing temporal change in lake DOC concentrations.

TI  - Systematically variable planktonic carbon metabolism along a land-to-lake gradient in a Great Lakes coastal zone.
PY  - 2014
AB  - During the summers of 2002–2013, we measured rates of carbon metabolism in surface waters of six sites across a land-to-lake gradient from the upstream end of drowned river-mouth Muskegon Lake (ML) (freshwater estuary) to 19 km offshore in Lake Michigan (LM) (a Great Lake). Despite considerable inter-year variability, the average rates of gross production (GP), respiration (R) and net production (NP) across ML (604 ± 58, 222 ± 22 and 381 ± 52 µg C L−1 day−1, respectively) decreased steeply in the furthest offshore LM site (22 ± 3, 55 ± 17 and −33 ± 15 µg C L−1day−1, respectively). Along this land-to-lake gradient, GP decreased by 96 ± 1%, whereas R only decreased by 75 ± 9%, variably influencing the carbon balance along this coastal zone. All ML sites were consistently net autotrophic (mean GP:R = 2.7), while the furthest offshore LM site was net heterotrophic (mean GP:R = 0.4). Our study suggests that pelagic waters of this Great Lakes coastal estuary are net carbon sinks that transition into net carbon sources offshore. Reactive and dynamic estuarine coastal zones everywhere may contribute similarly to regional and global carbon cycles.

TI  - Conceptualising the interactive effects of climate change and biological invasions on subarctic freshwater fish.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Climate change and species invasions represent key threats to global biodiversity. Subarctic freshwaters are sentinels for understanding both stressors because the effects of climate change are disproportionately strong at high latitudes and invasion of temperate species is prevalent. Here, we summarize the environmental effects of climate change and illustrate the ecological responses of freshwater fishes to these effects, spanning individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Climate change is modifying hydrological cycles across atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic components of subarctic ecosystems, causing increases in ambient water temperature and nutrient availability. These changes affect the individual behavior, habitat use, growth and metabolism, alter population spawning and recruitment dynamics, leading to changes in species abundance and distribution, modify food web structure, trophic interactions and energy flow within communities and change the sources, quantity and quality of energy and nutrients in ecosystems. Increases in temperature and its variability in aquatic environments underpin many ecological responses; however, altered hydrological regimes, increasing nutrient inputs and shortened ice cover are also important drivers of climate change effects and likely contribute to context-dependent responses. Species invasions are a complex aspect of the ecology of climate change because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect and a driver of the ecological consequences of climate change. Using subarctic freshwaters as an example, we illustrate how climate change can alter three distinct aspects of species invasions: (1) the vulnerability of ecosystems to be invaded, (2) the potential for species to spread and invade new habitats, and (3) the subsequent ecological effects of invaders. We identify three fundamental knowledge gaps focused on the need to determine (1) how environmental and landscape characteristics influence the ecological impact of climate change, (2) the separate and combined effects of climate and non-native invading species and (3) the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms responsible for changes in patterns of biodiversity.

TI  - Predicting organic carbon in lakes from climate drivers and catchment properties
PY  - 2011
AB  - [1] We combine a synoptic data set on organic carbon (C) concentrations in ∼1000 Norwegian lakes with detailed information on catchment properties derived from digital maps of elevation, climate, vegetation density, and land use. The resulting regression model explains 83% of the variance in total organic C from eight predictor variables: mean air temperature, area specific runoff, terrain slope, vegetation density, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, water residence time, and catchment area fractions of bogs and arable land. Vegetation density, expressed as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was by far the strongest predictor, while area fraction of bogs in the catchment also gave a strong positive effect on organic C concentrations and export fluxes. The unbiased sampling of lakes relative to whole population of catchments in the region and the general robustness of the model, as witnessed by imputation and resampling tests, allowed confident prediction of organic C concentrations and export fluxes for all 20,000 catchments of the Norwegian mainland. The method used in this study can, with some modifications, be extended to larger geographical regions and holds promise for predicting organic C fluxes under changed climatic conditions.

TI  - Assessing carbon dynamics in natural and perturbed boreal aquatic systems
PY  - 2012
AB  - Most natural freshwater lakes are net greenhouse gases (GHG) emitters. Compared to 25 natural systems, human perturbations such as watershed wood harvesting and long term reservoir 26 impoundment lead to profound alterations of biogeochemical processes involved in the aquatic 27 cycle of carbon (C). We exploited these anthropogenic alterations to describe the C dynamics in 28 five lakes and two reservoirs from the boreal forest through the analysis of dissolved carbon 29 dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), oxygen (O2), and organic carbon (DOC), as well as total nitrogen 30 (TN) and phosphorus (TP). Dissolved and particulate organic matter, forest soil/litter and 31 leachates, as well as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were analyzed for elemental and stable 32 isotopic compositions (atomic C:N ratios, δ13Corg, δ13Cinorg and δ15Ntot). We found links between 33 the export of terrestrial OM to these systems and the dissolved CO2 and O2 concentrations in the 34 water column, as well as CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere. All systems were GHG emitters, with 35 greater emissions measured for systems with larger inputs of terrestrial OM. The differences in 36 CO2 concentrations and fluxes appear controlled by bacterial activity in the water column and the 37 sediment. Although we clearly observed differences in the aquatic C cycle between natural and 38 perturbed systems, more work on a larger number of water bodies, and encompassing all four 39 seasons should be undertaken to better understand the controls, rates, as well as spatial and 40 temporal variability of GHG emissions, and to make quantitatively meaningful comparisons of 41 GHG emissions (and other key variables) from natural and perturbed systems.

TI  - Effects of water colour on the pigment content of a floating-leaved macrophyte—Implications of lake brownification
PY  - 2022
AB  - Brownification of lakes is a widely spread environmental problem. Brownification is a severe phenomenon, because water colour strongly shapes lake ecosystems through effects on the physical–chemical environment and biological communities. The effects of brownification on aquatic macrophytes are poorly known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find out the effects of increasing water colour on the photosynthetic pigment content of the floating-leaved macrophyte Nuphar lutea. Field data on water quality and pigment content of N. lutea were collected from 27 lakes in southern and central Finland. The concentration of chlorophyll a+b in the floating laminae or in the petioles was not dependent on water colour, but the depth where the maximum chlorophyll a+b concentration was observed in the petioles, decreased with increasing water colour. Chlorophyll a:b ratio in the petioles and in the floating laminae decreased with increasing water colour. The response of the laminae was explained by decreased upward irradiance of light in high-colour lakes. However, the decreasing light intensity along increasing water colour could not alone explain the variations in chlorophyll a:b. The effects of water colour on the spectral composition of light probably also had a regulatory role. The results showed that the effects of lake brownification on pigments of macrophytes may not be limited to submerged species, but floating-leaved species can also be affected, with consequences for their photosynthesis.

TI  - Coupling between increased lake color and iron in boreal lakes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Increasing evidence show that lake color has increased more than DOC in several boreal lakes, promoted by enhanced levels of light absorbing iron (Fe). Fe levels show great spatial and temporal variations in northern freshwaters, and processes regulating long-term Fe trends as well as differences among lakes are not fully understood. In a boreal lake district of SE-Norway, the coupling between lake color and Fe were investigated in 24 non-productive lakes during 1983–2017. The lakes showed significant increases in color, total organic carbon (TOC), specific UV absorption and Fe with time. Based on regression models, TOC and Fe together explained 89% of lake color. Fe averagely contributed to 12% of the lake color. The color contribution from Fe was better predicted by the Fe-to-TOC ratio than the absolute Fe concentration. The variability in Fe contribution to color was large - ranging from 0 to 65% based on 429 lake water samples. Variability in Fe levels and color contribution were related to differences in water retention time (WRT), pH and to the terrestrial input of Fe-organic matter complexes. Size fractionation analyses showed that Fe and colored TOC were mainly in a colloidal form (>10 kDa). Along with reduced acid rain, there has been a significant reduction in ionic strength in several boreal lakes since 1980s, which promote the stability of colloids. Negative correlation between the Fe-to-TOC ratio and WRT, might be due to a size selective removal of colloidal Fe complexes related to water flow, which is supported by a higher Fe-to-TOC ratio in wet years compared to dry years. Responses of Fe complexes to increased runoff are relatively higher in lakes with short compared to long WRT. In addition, increases in hydrological extremes, due to climate change, may enhance the Fe variability among lakes even further in a future climate.

TI  - Catchment vegetation and temperature mediating trophic interactions and production in plankton communities.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Climatic factors influence the interactions among trophic levels in an ecosystem in multiple ways. However, whereas most studies focus on single factors in isolation, mainly due to interrelation and correlation among drivers complicating interpretation and analyses, there are still only few studies on how multiple ecosystems respond to climate related factors at the same time. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model with a bioenergetic predator-prey framework to study how different climatic factors affect trophic interactions and production in small Arctic lakes. Natural variation in temperature and catchment land-cover was used as a natural experiment to exemplify how interactions between and production of primary producers (phytoplankton) and grazers (zooplankton) are driven by direct (temperature) and indirect (catchment vegetation) factors, as well as the presence or absence of apex predators (fish). The results show that increased vegetation cover increased phytoplankton growth rate by mediating lake nutrient concentration. At the same time, increased temperature also increased grazing rates by zooplankton. Presence of fish increased zooplankton mortality rates, thus reducing grazing. The Arctic is currently experiencing an increase in both temperature and shrub vegetation cover due to climate change, a trend, which is likely to continue. Our results point towards a possible future general weakening of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and greening of arctic lakes with increasing temperatures. At the same time, the impact of the presence of an apex predator indicate considerable local variation in the response. This makes direction and strength of global change impacts difficult to forecast.

TI  - From lake to estuary, the tale of two waters: a study of aquatic continuum biogeochemistry
PY  - 2018
AB  - The balance of fresh and saline water is essential to estuarine ecosystem function. Along the fresh-brackish-saline water gradient within the C-43 canal/Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE), the quantity, timing and distribution of water, and associated water quality significantly influence ecosystem function. Long-term trends of water quality and quantity were assessed from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE between May 1978 and April 2016. Significant changes to monthly flow volumes were detected between the lake and the estuary which correspond to changes in upstream management. and climatic events. Across the 37-year period, total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentration significantly increased at the lake; meanwhile, total nitrogen (TN) FMW concentrations significantly declined at both the lake and estuary headwaters. Between May 1999 and April 2016, TN, TP, and total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-P, and ammonium conditions were assessed within the estuary at several monitoring locations. Generally, nutrient concentrations decreased from upstream to downstream with shifts in TN/TP from values > 20 in the freshwater portion, ~ 20 in the estuarine portion, and < 20 in the marine portion indicating a spatial shift in nutrient limitations along the continuum. Aquatic productivity analysis suggests that the estuary is net heterotrophic with productivity being negatively influenced by TP, TN, and TOC likely due to a combination of effects including shading by high color dissolved organic matter. We conclude that rainfall patterns, land use, and the resulting discharges of runoff drive the ecology of the C-43/CRE aquatic continuum and associated biogeochemistry rather than water management associated with Lake Okeechobee.

TI  - Environmental determinants of chironomid communities in remote northern lakes across the treeline – Implications for climate change assessments
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Chironomids ( Diptera : Chironomidae ) in northern lakes are especially sensitive to climate change impacts. In addition, environmental factors other than direct temperature increase might play an important role in functioning of these keystone aquatic communities. We examined 31 lakes at the treeline ecotone in subarctic Finnish Lapland for their surface sediment chironomid fauna to assess the influence of different environmental factors on the communities. We aim to improve understanding of the climate-driven catchment and limnological factors, for the assessment of climate change impacts. Our results indicated that organic content of the sediment, total nitrogen, water depth and pH that are all likely to change under global warming had statistically significant influence on the chironomid assemblages and associated indicator taxa were assigned for these variables. In addition, a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) threshold (4 mg l −1 ) was observed that divided the study sites based on their chironomid composition. Sites with high DOC concentrations and benthic microbial mats had distinctive chironomid fauna from low-DOC sites without microbial mats indicating the significance of benthic versus planktonic productivity in the structure and functioning of polar lakes. The results provide important knowledge on chironomid-environmental relationships in climate-sensitive subarctic lakes and create basis for chironomid-based environmental change assessments in remote northern areas.

TI  - The Relationship between Primary Production and Respiration in the Photic Zone of the Great Mazurian Lakes (GMLS), in Relation to Trophic Conditions, Plankton Composition and Other Ecological Factors
PY  - 2017
AB  - The relation of primary production to respiration and dependence of both processes on various environmental factors were investigated in the surface waters of lakes of The Great Mazurian Lake System (GMLS) during summer seasons 2009–2011. Primary production and extracellular release was determined by 14C method, respiration (dark oxygen consumption) - by Winkler's method. Collected results allow to conclude that: (i) in all studied lakes primary production was primarily cyanobacterial, although in mesotrophic ones participation of eukaryotic phytoplankton in light CO2 fixation was more pronounced; (ii) in mesotrophic part of GMLS primary production was limited alternately by N and P availability and less dependent on N and P regeneration processes, whereas in southern, eutrophic lakes it was primarily fueled by regeneration of biogenic substances from organic compounds and strongly limited by N resources; (iii) although in photic zone of whole GMLS respiration was dominated by heterotrophic bacteria, in its mesotrophic part also participation of other plankton components in respiration processes was significant and, (iv) that in eutrophic lakes planktonic respiration was more dependent on low molecular weight products liberated enzymatically from organic substrates than on organic compounds released by primary producers. The mean production to respiration ratio, which varied from 2.11 to 2.60 in northern, and from 2.05 to 3.67 in southern lakes suggested that during period of investigations photic zones of lakes of both parts of GMLS were net autotrophic systems.

TI  - Methane as a carbon source for the food web in raised bog pools
PY  - 2013
AB  - AbstractRaised bog pools are extremely nutrient poor and rich in humic substances, and these features limit primary production. To assess the base of the invertebrate food web in bog pools we measured the stable-isotopic signatures of primary producers, dead organic matter, and invertebrates, and the composition and stable-C-isotope ratio of their phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs). The stable-isotopic signatures showed the presence of multiple trophic levels and differential use of basal food sources by the invertebrates among and within species, individuals, and size classes. Carnivorous and omnivorous invertebrates assimilated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from algae, and possibly macrophytes, and fatty acids that are specific for methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). Part of the bacterial biomass conveyed to higher trophic levels in the bog pools originated from MOB. Pelagic zooplankton appeared to rely more on bacteria, whereas insects relied more on algae. Periphyton, a primary algal...

TI  - Improving remote sensing estimation of Secchi disk depth for global lakes and reservoirs using machine learning methods
PY  - 2022
AB  - Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a simple but particularly important indicator for characterizing the overall water quality status and assessing the long-term dynamics of water quality for diverse global waters. For this reason, countless efforts have been made to collect SDD data from the field and through remote sensing systems. Many empirical and semianalytical algorithms have been proposed to estimate SDD from different satellite images for a specific or regional water. However, the construction of a robust global SDD estimation model is still challenging due to the nonlinear response of SDD to optical properties and the complex physical and biogeochemical processes of different waters. Therefore, machine learning methods to better interpret nonlinear processes were used to improve remote sensing estimations of SDD for global lakes and reservoirs based on a global matchup dataset from Landsat TM (N = 4099), ETM+ (N = 2420), and OLI (N = 1249) covering in situ SDD from 0.01 m to over 18 m. Overall, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) had better SDD retrievals than back propagation neural network, support vector regression, empirical and quasi-analytical models showing high precision with mean relative error of approximately 30% and good agreements with the long-term in situ SDD in different waters with various optical properties. Our results can support long-term global-level water quality evaluation and thus making informed decisions about development policy.

TI  - Changes in food characteristics reveal indirect effects of lake browning on zooplankton performance
PY  - 2019
AB  - Browning caused by colored dissolved organic matter is predicted to have large effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, there is limited experimental evidence about direct and indirect effects of browning on zooplankton in complex ﬁeld settings. We used a combination of an ecosystem-scale enclosure experiment and laboratory incubations to test how prolonged browning affects physiological and life-history traits of the water ﬂea Daphnia longispina, a key species in lake food webs, and whether any such effects are reversible. Daphnids and water were collected from enclosures in a deep clear-water lake, where the natural plankton community had been exposed for 10 weeks to browning or to control conditions in clear water. Daphnid abundance was much lower in the brown than in the clear enclosure. Surprisingly, however, daphnids continuously kept in brown enclosure water in the laboratory showed increased metabolic performance and survival, and also produced more offspring than daphnids kept in clear enclosure water. This outcome was related to more and higher-quality seston in brown compared to clear water. Moreover, daphnids transferred from clear to brown water or vice versa adjusted their nucleic acid and protein contents, as indicators of physiological state, to similar levels as individuals previously exposed to the respective recipient environment, indicating immediate and reversible browning effects on metabolic performance. These results demonstrate the importance of conducting experiments in settings that capture both indirect effects (i.e., emerging from species interactions in communities) and direct effects on individuals for assessing impacts of browning and other environmental changes on lakes.

TI  - Reviewing peatland forestry: Implications and mitigation measures for freshwater ecosystem browning
PY  - 2023
AB  - Freshwaters of the boreal and temperate regions have experienced increased browning during the last decades. Browning, or brownification, is mostly driven by increased organic carbon (OC) and iron concentrations. It can cause detrimental changes in aquatic ecosystems through effects on chemistry, physics and ecology. Additionally, browning can impact aquatic greenhouse gas emissions, increase the costs of drinking water treatment and weaken the recreational value of water bodies. All these impacts call for means to mitigate the excess export of humic matter to aquatic ecosystems. Browning has often been associated with decreased atmospheric sulphur deposition and climate change-induced alterations in temperature, vegetation and the hydrological regime of catchments. Lately, it has been attributed to changes in land use, especially drainage of peatlands for forestry purposes and afforestation. In this review, we evaluate the impacts of peatland forestry operations on OC leaching and assess possible mitigation measures. We reveal that traditional, even-aged forest management with clear felling, site preparation and ditch cleaning creates hot spots for OC leaching and hot moments for carbon-rich runoff due to fluctuations in hydrology, peat decomposition and peat exposure. Simultaneously, most of the current water protection measures are either ineffective or ambiguous in retaining OC, especially in a dissolved form. Hence, management practices that prevent future peat decomposition and reduce hydrological connectivity are essential to reduce negative water quality impacts. We conclude that a systemic change would be needed to prevent formation of loading and excess OC leaching. More research is needed, but it seems that a transition towards more natural and diverse peatland forest management with abundantly applied continuous cover forestry, mixed forest cover and improved catchment retention by peatland restoration could result in fewer undesirable water quality impacts. Protecting biodiversity and counteracting negative climate impacts requires the integration of updated management practices into future forest policies and guidelines, as the green shift towards a bioeconomy will create an increasing demand for the sustainable use of peatland forests.

TI  - Terrestrial support of lake food webs: Synthesis reveals controls over cross-ecosystem resource use
PY  - 2017
AB  - Widespread evidence that organic matter exported from terrestrial into aquatic ecosystems supports recipient food webs remains controversial. A pressing question is not only whether high terrestrial support is possible but also what the general conditions are under which it arises. We assemble the largest data set, to date, of the isotopic composition (δ2H, δ13C, and δ15N) of lake zooplankton and the resources at the base of their associated food webs. In total, our data set spans 559 observations across 147 lakes from the boreal to subtropics. By predicting terrestrial resource support from within-lake and catchment-level characteristics, we found that half of all consumer observations that is, the median were composed of at least 42% terrestrially derived material. In general, terrestrial support of zooplankton was greatest in lakes with large physical and hydrological connections to catchments that were rich in aboveground and belowground organic matter. However, some consumers responded less strongly to terrestrial resources where within-lake production was elevated. Our study shows that multiple mechanisms drive widespread cross-ecosystem support of aquatic consumers across Northern Hemisphere lakes and suggests that changes in terrestrial landscapes will influence ecosystem processes well beyond their boundaries.

TI  - Time‐varying responses of lake metabolism to light and temperature
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Light is a primary driver of lake ecosystem metabolism, and the dependence of primary production on light is often quantified as a photosynthesis‐irradiance or “P‐I” curve. The parameters of the P‐I curve (e.g., the maximum primary production when light is in excess) can change through time due to a variety of biological factors (e.g., changes in biomass or community composition), which themselves are subject to external drivers (e.g., herbivory or nutrient availability). However, the relative contribution of variation in the P‐I curve to overall ecosystem metabolism is largely unknown. I developed a statistical model of ecosystem metabolism with time‐varying parameters governing the P‐I curve, while also accounting for the influence of temperature. I parameterized the model with dissolved oxygen time series spanning six summers from Lake Mývatn, a shallow eutrophic lake in northern Iceland with large temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism. All of the estimated parameters of the P‐I curve varied substantially through time. The sensitivity of primary production to light under light‐limiting conditions was particularly variable (&gt;15‐fold) and had a compensatory relationship with ambient light levels. However, the 3.5‐fold variation in the maximum potential primary production made the largest contribution to variation in ecosystem metabolism, accounting for around 90% of the variance in net ecosystem production. Much of the variation in maximum primary production was attributable to cyanobacterial blooms, which occur in some but not all years in Mývatn. Overall, these results illustrate how changes in the P‐I curve contribute substantially to temporal variation in lake ecosystem metabolism.</jats:p>

TI  - Optical diversity of thaw ponds in discontinuous permafrost: A model system for water color analysis
PY  - 2011
AB  - [1] Permafrost thaw ponds result from the irregular melting and erosion of frozen soils, and they are active sites of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere throughout the circumpolar North. In the discontinuous permafrost region of Nunavik, Canada, thaw ponds show pronounced differences in color even among nearby ponds, ranging from white to green, brown and black. To quantify this optical variation and to determine its underlying controlling mechanisms, we studied the apparent and inherent optical properties and limnological characteristics of the ponds. The pond colors were well separated on a color coordinate diagram, with axis values determined from above‐water spectral reflectance measurements. Our analyses of optical properties and their empirical relationships with optically active substances showed that the differences in color could entirely be attributed to variations in the concentration of two optically active substances: dissolved organic carbon, which was a major contributor to spectral absorption, and nonalgal suspended particulate matter, which contributed to spectral scattering as well as absorption. The latter component was dominated by small sized particles that had unusually high mass‐specific absorption and scattering properties. Analysis of high spatial resolution, multispectral satellite imagery of these ponds showed that these two optically important constituents could be estimated by multivariate modeling. The results indicate that remote sensing surveys will provide valuable synoptic observations of permafrost thaw ponds across the vast subarctic region, and may allow scaling up of local greenhouse gas flux measurements to regional and circumpolar scales.

TI  - Altered environmental light drives retinal change in the Atlantic Tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) over timescales relevant to marine environmental disturbance.
PY  - 2018
AB  - For many fish species, retinal function changes between life history stages as part of an encoded developmental program. Retinal change is also known to exhibit plasticity because retinal form and function can be influenced by light exposure over the course of development. Aside from studies of gene expression, it remains largely unknown whether retinal plasticity can provide functional responses to short-term changes in environmental light quality. The aim of this study was to determine whether the structure and function of the fish retina can change in response to altered light intensity and spectrum—not over the course of a developmental regime, but over shorter time periods relevant to marine habitat disturbance. The effects of light environment on sensitivity of the retina, as well as on cone photoreceptor distribution were examined in the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) on 2- and 4-month timescales. In a spectral experiment, juvenile M. atlanticus were placed in either ‘red’ or ‘blue’ light conditions (with near identical irradiance), and in an intensity experiment, juveniles were placed in either ‘bright’ or ‘dim’ light conditions (with near identical spectra). Analysis of the retina by electroretinography and anti-opsin immunofluorescence revealed that relative to fish held in the blue condition, those in the red condition exhibited longer-wavelength peak sensitivity and greater abundance of long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cone photoreceptors over time. Following pre-test dark adaption of the retina, fish held in the dim light required less irradiance to produce a standard retinal response than fish held in bright light, developing a greater sensitivity to white light over time. The results show that structure and function of the M. atlanticus retina can rapidly adjust to changes in environmental light within a given developmental stage, and that such changes are dependent on light quality and the length of exposure. These findings suggest that the fish retina may be resilient to disturbances in environmental light, using retinal plasticity to compensate for changes in light quality over short timescales.

TI  - Abundance of mixoplanktonic algae in relation to prey, light and nutrient limitation in a dystrophic lake: a mesocosm study
PY  - 2021
AB  - The role of mixoplanktonic algae is increasingly recognised as an important link between primary production and microbial loop processes, particularly in dystrophic systems where staining can both limit light and nutrient availability and increase bacterial productivity. We hypothesised that these three factors would affect the relative abundance of mixotrophs (RAmixotrophs), with increased light and nutrient availability decreasing RAmixotrophs and increased bacterial availability increasing RAmixotrophs. We employed a fully factorial design within near-shore mesocosms in a highly stained lake, with light intensity, bacterial abundance, and phosphorus concentration as treatment variables. Over the initial 3 days of the experiment, when changes were greatest, we found no significant three-way interaction effect among light, phosphorus and nutrients on the RAmixotrophs. We did find significant two-way interactions between phosphorus and light, and phosphorus and bacteria. RAmixotrophs was decreased by the addition of phosphorus whether light was added or not, but light only significantly deceased RAmixotrophs when phosphorus was not added. Phosphorus concentration was also found to decrease RAmixotrophs whether bacterial food was supplemented or not, but bacteria increased RAmixotrophs only in mesocosms without phosphorus additions. Collectively, our results indicated that phosphorus concentrations may be the primary driver of mixoplanktonic phytoplankton dynamics in dystrophic systems.

TI  - Light availability affects stream biofilm bacterial community composition and function, but not diversity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Changes in riparian vegetation or water turbidity and browning in streams alter the local light regime with potential implications for stream biofilms and ecosystem functioning. We experimented with biofilms in microcosms grown under a gradient of light intensities (range: 5-152 μmole photons s-1 m-2 ) and combined 454-pyrosequencing and enzymatic activity assays to evaluate the effects of light on biofilm structure and function. We observed a shift in bacterial community composition along the light gradient, whereas there was no apparent change in alpha diversity. Multifunctionality, based on extracellular enzymes, was highest under high light conditions and decoupled from bacterial diversity. Phenol oxidase activity, involved in the degradation of polyphenolic compounds, was twice as high on average under the lowest compared with the highest light condition. This suggests a shift in reliance of microbial heterotrophs on biofilm phototroph-derived organic matter under high light availability to more complex organic matter under low light. Furthermore, extracellular enzyme activities correlated with nutrient cycling and community respiration, supporting the link between biofilm structure-function and biogeochemical fluxes in streams. Our findings demonstrate that changes in light availability are likely to have significant impacts on biofilm structure and function, potentially affecting stream ecosystem processes.

TI  - The role of sediments in the carbon budget of a small boreal lake
PY  - 2016
AB  - Inland waters are active sites of carbon (C) processing and emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. In the boreal zone, where surface waters receive large quantities of organic carbon (OC) from surrounding forests and wetlands, lakes and streams act as strong sources of these greenhouse gases. Lake sediments provide the only long-term sink of C in boreal inland waters, through burial of OC. However, mineralization of OC counteracts the efficiency of lake sediments in removing C from the short-term C cycle. In this context, this thesis provides a better insight into the dual role of boreal lake sediments as C source and C sink.The presented work is based on empirical assessments of OC burial and OC mineralization rates in boreal lakes. The temporal variability of OC burial and the stability of the buried OC was assessed on both centennial and millennial timescales. The quantitative importance of sediment OC burial and mineralization in comparison both to other C fluxes within the lake, and to C fluxes within the tributary stream network, was quantified. By simulating the effect of climate change on water temperature, we also gauged the potential future efficiency of lake sediments in storing C.The results demonstrate that OC mineralization in sediments dominates three-fold over OC burial when observed at a whole-basin and annual scale. The contribution of sediment OC mineralization to annual C emission from the assessed study lake was, however, found to be small (16%), when compared to OC mineralization in the water column (37%) and catchment import of C (47%). Furthermore, C emission from headwater streams was found to dominate greatly over the lake C emission, mainly triggered by the higher gas transfer velocity of streams compared to lakes.On a long-term (Holocene) scale, the continuous OC burial flux results in a large amount of C stored in sediments. The temporal variability of this OC accumulation was found to vary across lakes, with, however, time-dependent patterns: On a millennial scale, smaller lakes exhibited a higher variability than larger lakes of the study area. For the last century, similar variability and a trend to increased OC accumulation was found for most study lakes, irrespective of their size. Analysis of lignin phenols in the accumulated OC did not indicated post-depositional degradation, independent of the age of the sediment OC, implying that sediments are a very stable sink for land-derived OC in boreal lakes.Simulation of warming water temperatures in boreal lakes resulted in declines of the OC burial efficiency BE (OCBE; OC burial/OCdeposition) up to 16%, depending, however, on basin morphometry. Predicted declines in OCBE were higher for the more shallow lake compared to the deeper lake.In conclusion, this thesis illustrates that sediments play, despite a small quantitative impact on aquatic C cycling, an important role as a very stable C sink in boreal lakes. However, the efficiency of this C sink is likely to be reduced in the future.

TI  - Impacts of shelter on the relative dominance of primary producers and trophic transfer efficiency in aquatic food webs: Implications for shallow lake restoration
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:list> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Wind‐induced turbulence can strongly impact ecological processes in shallow lake ecosystems. The creation of shelter against wind can be expected to affect both primary producers and herbivores in aquatic food webs. Shelter may benefit particular primary producers more than others by changing relative resource availabilities for different primary producers. Herbivore community compositions may be affected either directly or indirectly as a consequence of changes in their food quantity and quality that, in turn, may affect the transfer efficiency between primary producers and herbivores.

TI  - Nutrient release from moose bioturbation in aquatic ecosystems
PY  - 2016
AB  - While the ecological importance of bioturbation is well recognized and the prevalence of aquatic foraging by terrestrial ungulates is increasingly appreciated, research linking how terrestrial ungulates function as disturbance mechanisms via bioturbation in freshwater systems is lacking. The purpose of this study was to quantify potential nutrient pulses released from benthic sediments into the water column when moose Alces alces feed on aquatic plants. We also determined if we could experimentally mimic the benthic disturbance and the expected nutrient pulse created when moose feed aquatically. When moose foraged aquatically, significant releases of both total and dissolved phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) resulted in the waters that were disturbed in foraging areas compared to adjacent undisturbed waters. Nutrient concentrations for total P and N ranged from 42.5× and 2.7× greater in disturbed than undisturbed, respectively. Dissolved P and N were 26.8× and 1.5× greater, respectively, in disturbed versus undisturbed waters. Our experimental mimic created increases of total and dissolved P and N that were equivalent to pulses created by moose. This indicates that it is possible to experimentally test by proxy the potential impact of moose bioturbation on other ecosystem processes. This study is the first quantification of moose foraging as a consumer mechanism that influences the release of limiting nutrients in aquatic systems, thereby emphasizing the potential cascading importance for nutrient uptake and productivity of plants and microbes.

TI  - Biota Interactions for Ecological Assessment of a Deteriorated Coastal Lake following a Brief Period of Restoration
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The coastal lake, Maruit, was one of the most productive coastal ecosystems in Egypt until the 1960s. It experienced long-term deterioration due to continuous discharge of pollutants from Alexandria city into its basins. The Egyptian government started a restoration program in 2010 to divert pollution sources away from the lake. Samples were collected in November 2012 to assess the biological condition of Lake Maruit using parasitism and predation as biological linkages between pelagic and benthic communities. A preliminary survey of ectoparasites infesting tilapia fish was carried out during this study. Ectoparasites that were retained from 300 sampled tilapia fish were identified. Two groups of platyhelminth ectoparasites, Monogenea,<jats:italic> Cichlidogyrus sp.,</jats:italic> and the parasitic-copepod, <jats:italic>Ergasilus lizae,</jats:italic> were detected. Ectoparasite Platyhelminthes infected the fish<jats:italic> Oreochromis niloticus and O. aureus</jats:italic>, whereas the crustacean parasitized <jats:italic>Coptodon zillii.</jats:italic> The parasitic prevalence was 15% and 3% for <jats:italic>Cichlidogyrus sp</jats:italic>., and <jats:italic>Ergasilus lizae</jats:italic>, respectively. Benthic biotas were similar among basins, which could indicate successful restoration. The lack of response of fish abundance to benthic biotic components indicates few direct trophic links. Phytoplankton and benthic microalgae were not the main fish diet. It was found that Halacaridae and fish data clustered, suggesting either Halacaridae are simply responding like fish or that fish are preying on them because they have a relatively large size. Unexpectedly, linear connections between the populations of biota and the parasite-infected fish were found, suggesting that parasites may control the behavior of their hosts. Organic matter concentration was the main driver of the lake ecosystem biota. While the low parasitism rate and lack of eutrophication is evidence of recovery, the low biota abundance, lack of fish and faunal diversity, and limited linkage among food web components indicate the restoration was incomplete or Lake Maruit was still suffering from degradation in 2012.</jats:p>

TI  - Reconciling the role of organic matter pathways in aquatic food webs by measuring multiple tracers in individuals
PY  - 2015
AB  - Few studies measure multiple ecological tracers in individual organisms, thus limiting our ability to differentiate among organic matter source pathways and understand consequences of dietary variation and the use of external subsidies in complex food webs. We combined two tracers, stable isotope (SI) ratios and fatty acids (FA), to investigate linkages among ecological compartments (water column, benthos, riparian zone) in food webs in waterholes of a dryland river network, the Border Rivers in southwestern Queensland, Australia. Comprehensive analyses of sources (plankton, periphyton, leaf litter, riparian grasses) and animals (benthic insects, mollusks, large crustaceans, fishes) for SI and FA showed that all three zones contribute to animal biomass, depending on species and life stage. Large fishes derived a subsidy from the riparian/floodplain zone, likely through the consumption of terrestrial and semi-aquatic insects and prawns that fed on detritivorous insects. Importantly, post-larval bony bream (Nematalosa erebi) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) were tightly connected to the water column, as evidenced by 13C-depleted, 15N-enriched isotope ratios and a high content of plankton-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA; 20:53] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA; 22:6003]). These observations were consistent with expectations from nutritional requirements of fish early life stages and habitat changes associated with maturity. These results highlight the importance of high-quality foods during early development of fishes, and show that attempting to attribute food-web production to a single source pathway overlooks important but often subtle subsidies that maintain viable populations. A complete understanding of food-web dynamics must consider both quantity and quality of different available organic matter sources. This understanding can be achieved with a combined SI and FA approach, but more controlled dietary studies are needed to estimate how FA profiles are modified by animals when consuming a diverse range of diets of variable quality.

TI  - Benthic community metabolism in deep and shallow Arctic lakes during 13 years of whole–lake fertilization
PY  - 2015
AB  - Benthic primary production and oxygen consumption are important components of lake biogeochemical cycling. We performed whole–lake nutrient manipulations in Arctic Alaska to assess the controls of lake morphometry, nutrients, and light on benthic community metabolism. One deep, stratified lake (Lake E5) and one shallow, well–mixed lake (Lake E6) in the Alaskan Arctic were fertilized with low levels of nitrogen (56 mg N m−3 yr−1) and phosphorus (8 mg P m−3 yr−1) from 2001 to 2013. Benthic primary production was not stimulated by fertilization in either lake. In the deep lake, decreased water clarity is consistent with an increase in phytoplankton biomass during fertilization. Benthic GPP decreased by 7–47 mg C m−2 d−1 (not statistically significant) and benthic respiration increased from 87 ± 20 to 167 ± 9 (SE) mg C m−2 d−1. The areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit increased by 15 mg O2 m−2 d−1 each year during the 13 yr of monitoring, apparently driven by lower (more negative) benthic NEP. In the shallow lake, phytoplankton concentration did not change with fertilization. As a result, the light environment did not change and benthic GPP did not decrease. Overall the data suggest that (1) benthic algae are not nutrient limited in either the deep or shallow lake, (2) lake morphometry modulated the overall nutrient impact on benthic metabolism by controlling the response of phytoplankton, and by extension, light and organic carbon supply to the benthos, (3) year–to–year variability in light attenuation explains considerable variability in benthic GPP between lakes and years, (4) correlations between both dissolved organic carbon concentrations and light attenuation coefficients (kd) between lakes suggests a regional control on light attenuation, and (5) the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep experimental lake are highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment.

TI  - Can humic water discharge counteract eutrophication in coastal waters
PY  - 2013
AB  - A common and established view is that increased inputs of nutrients to the sea, for example via river flooding, will cause eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms in coastal areas. We here show that this concept may be questioned in certain scenarios. Climate change has been predicted to cause increased inflow of freshwater to coastal areas in northern Europe. River waters in these areas are often brown from the presence of high concentrations of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (humic carbon), in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus. In this study we investigated whether increased inputs of humic carbon can change the structure and production of the pelagic food web in the recipient seawater. In a mesocosm experiment unfiltered seawater from the northern Baltic Sea was fertilized with inorganic nutrients and humic carbon (CNP), and only with inorganic nutrients (NP). The system responded differently to the humic carbon addition. In NP treatments bacterial, phytoplankton and zooplankton production increased and the systems turned net autotrophic, whereas the CNP-treatment only bacterial and zooplankton production increased driving the system to net heterotrophy. The size-structure of the food web showed large variations in the different treatments. In the enriched NP treatments the phytoplankton community was dominated by filamentous >20 µm algae, while in the CNP treatments the phytoplankton was dominated by picocyanobacteria <5 µm. Our results suggest that climate change scenarios, resulting in increased humic-rich river inflow, may counteract eutrophication in coastal waters, leading to a promotion of the microbial food web and other heterotrophic organisms, driving the recipient coastal waters to net-heterotrophy.

TI  - Terrestrial organic matter input suppresses biomass production in lake ecosystems
PY  - 2015
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems export large amounts of organic carbon (t-OC) but the net effect of this OC on the productivity of recipient aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. In this study of boreal lakes, we show that the relative contribution of t-OC to individual top consumer (fish) biomass production, and to most of their potential prey organisms, increased with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; dominated by t-OC sources) in water. However, the biomass and production of top consumers decreased with increasing concentration of DOC, despite their substantial use (up to 60%) of t-OC. Thus, the results suggest that although t-OC supports individual consumer growth in lakes to a large extent, t-OC input suppresses rather than subsidizes population biomass production.

TI  - Photoreceptors and eyes of pikeperch Sander lucioperca, pike Esox lucius, perch Perca fluviatilis and roach Rutilus rutilus from a clear and a brown lake.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The photoreceptors and eyes of four fish species commonly cohabiting Fennoscandian lakes with different light transmission properties were compared: pikeperch Sander lucioperca, pike Esox lucius, perch Perca fluviatilis and roach Rutilus rutilus. Each species was represented by individuals from a clear (greenish) and a humic (dark brown) lake in southern Finland: Lake Vesijarvi (LV; peak transmission around 570 nm) and Lake Tuusulanjarvi (LT; peak transmission around 630 nm). In the autumn, all species had almost purely A2-based visual pigments. Rod absorption spectra peaked at c.526 nm (S. lucioperca), c. 533 nm (E. lucius) and c. 540 nm (P. fluviatilis and R. rutilus), with no differences between the lakes. Esox lucius rods had remarkably long outer segments, 1.5–2.8-fold longer than those of the other species. All species possessed middle-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) and long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cone pigments in single, twin or double cones. Rutilus rutilus also had two types of short-wavelength sensitive (SWS) cones: UV-sensitive [SWS1] and blue-sensitive (SWS2) cones, although in the samples from LT no UV cones were found. No other within-species differences in photoreceptor cell complements, absorption spectra or morphologies were found between the lakes. However, E. lucius eyes had a significantly lower focal ratio in LT compared with LV, enhancing sensitivity at the expense of acuity in the dark-brown lake. Comparing species, S. lucioperca was estimated to have the highest visual sensitivity, at least two times higher than similar-sized E. lucius, thanks to the large relative size of the eye (pupil) and the presence of a reflecting tapetum behind the retina. High absolute sensitivity will give a competitive edge also in terms of short reaction times and long visual range. (Less)

TI  - Soil–solution partitioning of DOC in acid organic soils: results from a UK field acidification and alkalization experiment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle and has profound impacts on water chemistry and metabolism in lakes and rivers. Reported increases of DOC concentration in surface waters across Europe and Northern America have been attributed to several drivers, including changing climate, changing land-use to eutrophication and declining acid deposition. The latter of these suggests that acidic deposition suppressed the solubility of DOC, and that this historic suppression is now being reversed by reducing emissions of acidifying pollutants. We studied a set of four parallel acidification and alkalization experiments in organic matter-rich soils, which, after three years of manipulation, have shown distinct soil solution DOC responses to acidity change. We tested whether these DOC concentration changes were related to changes in the acid/base properties of DOC. Based on laboratory determination of DOC site density (S.D. = amount of carboxylic groups per milligram DOC) and charge density (C.D. = organic acid anion concentration per milligram DOC) we found that the change in DOC soil–solution partitioning was tightly related to the change in degree of dissociation (α = C.D.:S.D. ratio) of organic acids (R 2 = 0.74, P < 0.01). Carbon turnover in soil organic matter (SOM), determined by soil respiration and β-D-glucosidase enzyme activity measurements, also appears to have some impact on DOC leaching, via constraints on the actual supply of available DOC from SOM; when the turnover rate of C in SOM is small, the effect of α on DOC leaching is reduced. Thus, differences in the magnitude of DOC changes seen across different environments might be explained by interactions between physicochemical restrictions of DOC soil–solution partitioning and SOM carbon turnover effects on DOC supply.

TI  - Nitrate amendment reduces biofilm biomass and shifts microbial communities in remote, oligotrophic ponds
PY  - 2018
AB  - AbstractHumans have increased the amount of reactive N available in the environment by over an order of magnitude since the industrial revolution. Most studies have been conducted in ecosystems with pervasive anthropogenic nutrient inputs, so little is understood about how naive biofilm communities respond to elevated nutrients. Our nutrient-diffusing substrate (NDS) experiments, which were conducted in Alaskan freshwater ponds with very little anthropogenic nutrient inputs, suggest that P limits biofilm photoautotrophs. However, despite low water-column nutrient concentrations, overall biofilm biomass was not enhanced by the addition of N or P. Rather, we observed an ~60% biomass reduction with NO3– amendment in 15 oligotrophic ponds across 2 y. This widespread biomass reduction was accompanied by changes in microbial communities, but these trends were not observed with NH4+ or P amendment. Nonamended communities (i.e., no nutrient amendment other than lysogeny broth agar) were characterized by anaerobic...

TI  - Warming and browning of lakes: consequences for pelagic carbon metabolism and sediment delivery
PY  - 2013
AB  - 1. Thousands of lakes in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a continuous increase in water temperature and colour. While increasing temperature is an effect of climate change, several factors are suggested to drive the increasing water colour, including climate change, altered land use and reversed acidification. 2. In this mesocosm study, we study the effects on pelagic production and sedimentation of organic carbon from a 3 degrees C increase in temperature, a doubling of water colour and a combination of increased temperature and water colour. These manipulations correspond to the predicted development in water colour and temperature in northern temperate systems within the life time of the next generation. 3. The water and plankton communities in the mesocosms were taken from an oligohumic and mesotrophic lake, and the increase in water colour was achieved by the additions of water from a humic lake. The experiment ran from early March to late October. 4. In accordance with our predictions and previous cross-system analyses, net carbon production (NCP) and organic carbon sedimentation decreased in response to increasing water colour. 5. At odds with current theory, NCP and sedimentation increased in heated treatments, as not only respiration but also gross production increased in response to temperature. There were no synergistic effects between warming and browning. 6. These results imply that warming may enhance pelagic delivery of organic carbon to sediments. This could potentially offset a reduction in burial efficiency of organic carbon, which has been projected based on a positive relationship between carbon mineralisation in sediments and temperature.

TI  - Magnitude and regulation of zooplankton community production across boreal lakes
PY  - 2017
AB  - A major outstanding question in plankton ecology is whether the regulation of zooplankton production at the community level follows the same patterns that have been observed for individual populations. We used a novel biochemical approach to estimate in situ rates of crustacean zooplankton community production in 83 boreal lakes, with the objective of identifying the main drivers of zooplankton production at the community level across the boreal landscape. Our results show that the relationship of zooplankton community production to average community body size, total biomass, and temperature is comparable to what has been observed for individual populations. At the community level, however, there are additional drivers, including lake morphometry, and catchment properties, which further influence zooplankton production and which cannot be inferred from population level patterns.

TI  - Post-depositional alteration of stable isotope signals by preferential degradation of algae-derived organic matter in reservoir sediments
PY  - 2022
AB  - Post-depositional degradation of organic matter (OM) in freshwater sediments is crucial for driving the biogeochemical dynamics and influencing the carbon burial. This process also often causes diagenetic alteration on paleoenvironmental proxies. Yet, mechanisms behind degradation of sedimentary OM and depth-related variations in stable isotope ratios can so far only be explained in part. Degradation of sedimentary OM in two drinking water reservoirs with contrasting eutrophic and mesotrophic states and different catchment land use (agriculture versus forestry) was studied. A 4-step procedure was used to chemically separate sedimentary OM in terms of biochemical composition. Here we presented depth profiles of biochemical composition of sedimentary OM that helped to quantify preferential degradation of aquatic proteins and carbohydrates and the following removal of aquatic lipids. Sediment in the eutrophic reservoir, which reflected a larger contribution of algal-derived OM than the mesotrophic reservoir with a forest dominated catchment, was therefore subject to more intensive degradation of sedimentary OM along with δ13C and δ15N alterations. In addition, changes in the relative proportions of biochemical components in sedimentary OM had more pronounced impact on δ15N values relative to δ13C. Our findings suggest that the lability of algae-derived OM leads to uncertainties for the estimation of carbon burial in water bodies and obscures paleo-limnological information derived from isotopic proxies. Post-depositional modifications are more pronounced in eutrophic freshwaters that accumulated more readily degradable OM of algal origin in their sediments. Recognition of these modifications will help constrain carbon burial rates of productive lakes and reservoirs and assess the role of reservoirs in carbon cycling.

TI  - Effects of Habitat-Specific Primary Production on Fish Size, Biomass, and Production in Northern Oligotrophic Lakes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ecological theory predicts that the relative distribution of primary production across habitats influence fish size structure and biomass production. In this study, we assessed individual, population, and community-level consequences for brown trout (<jats:italic>Salmo trutta</jats:italic>) and Arctic char (<jats:italic>Salvelinus alpinus</jats:italic>) of variation in estimated habitat specific (benthic and pelagic) and total whole lake (GPP<jats:sub>whole</jats:sub>) gross primary production in 27 northern oligotrophic lakes. We found that higher contribution of benthic primary production to GPP<jats:sub>whole</jats:sub>was associated with higher community biomass and larger maximum and mean sizes of fish. At the population level, species-specific responses differed. Increased benthic primary production (GPP<jats:sub>Benthic</jats:sub>) correlated to higher population biomass of brown trout regardless of being alone or in sympatry, while Arctic char responded positively to pelagic primary production (GPP<jats:sub>Pelagic</jats:sub>) in sympatric populations. In sympatric lakes, the maximum size of both species was positively related to both GPP<jats:sub>Benthic</jats:sub>and the benthic contribution to GPP<jats:sub>Whole</jats:sub>. In allopatric lakes, brown trout mean and maximum size and Arctic char mean size were positively related to the benthic proportion of GPP<jats:sub>Whole</jats:sub>. Our results highlight the importance of light-controlled benthic primary production for fish biomass production in oligotrophic northern lakes. Our results further suggest that consequences of ontogenetic asymmetry and niche shifts may cause the distribution of primary production across habitats to be more important than the total ecosystem primary production for fish size, population biomass, and production. Awareness of the relationships between light availability and asymmetric resource production favoring large fish and fish production may allow for cost-efficient and more informed management actions in northern oligotrophic lakes.</jats:p>

TI  - The future of upland water ecosystems of the UK in the 21st century: A synthesis
PY  - 2014
AB  - Upland waters are located upstream of the areas of direct human disturbance and intensive land use through industry, agriculture and urbanisation and are valued particularly as sources of potable water and as biodiverse freshwater habitats. Nonetheless, the impact of human activity can be detected even in some of the most remote lakes on the planet due to the effects of long-range transport of air pollutants and global climate change. In the UK, upland waters are threatened by a range of pressures including not only atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds, trace metals and organic pollutants, but also climate change, nutrient enrichment by deposited nitrogen and changing land-use or land management regimes. The threat from acid deposition has declined sharply since the 1980s but its legacy remains a major concern; recovery is taking place but even assuming a complete chemical and biological recovery to a pre-industrial baseline were possible, dynamic models suggest that this could take another 100 years. However, current climate change projections suggest that by then, UK upland waters will become much warmer, with lower summer streamflows, higher winter streamflows and a much reduced or even absent influence of snowfall and lake ice-cover. Hence there is no rationale for aspiring to the return of pre-industrial “reference” conditions because climate change is likely to shift the climatic baseline at an unprecedented rate. Meanwhile, expansion of forest planting, changing grazing regimes and management measures for peatland restoration, among other land-use pressure, will affect upland catchments in the UK with potentially major repercussions for aquatic ecosystems, both positive and negative. The challenge for scientists, policymakers and other stakeholders in the uplands is to determine not only the trajectory of change in upland waters, but also to define the ecological endpoints needed to provide the optimum range of ecosystem services for society. Integrated monitoring of the kind exemplified by the papers in this volume is a fundamental prerequisite in this regard.

TI  - Incomplete resilience of a shallow lake to a brownification event
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in many freshwater ecosystems of the northern hemisphere have increased in recent decades due to additional terrestrial inputs. This phenomenon, known as brownification, can strongly alter the physical, chemical, and biological traits of aquatic ecosystems. Extreme rainfall can also cause sudden brownification, known as blackwater events in rivers, while longer term effects on lakes are unknown. Here, we investigated the resilience of a small, temperate, shallow lake to a strong natural flooding-induced brownification event in 2011-2012. From initial DOC and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of ~12 and 0.04 mg L -1 , respectively, the lake rapidly reached peak DOC and TP concentrations of 60 and 0.35 mg L -1 , respectively. By the following year, water levels had returned close to initial values, yet two additional years of monitoring (until summer 2015) and a more recent sample in spring 2019 showed that the lake did not fully return to its pre-brownification state. Instead, DOC and TP concentrations plateaued at concentrations respectively 1.5-fold and twofold greater than pre-brownification values within less than two years and remained at these concentrations in spring 2019. During this initial recovery period the lake exhibited a decline of phytoplankton and a partial recovery of summer periphyton biomass and production, albeit a full return to pre-brownification values was not recorded in either case. DOC and TP concentrations were positively correlated to phytoplankton biomass and negatively to periphyton. As increases in phytoplankton production outpaced decreasing periphyton production, the net result of this brownification event has been an increase in whole-lake areal summertime primary production. This incomplete resilience to a flooding-induced brownification event implies consequences for several ecological and biogeochemical functions of shallow lakes that warrant further investigation and might contribute to the gradual increase of freshwater DOC concentrations in the northern hemisphere.

TI  - Seasonal shifts in export of DOC and nutrients from burned and unburned peatland-rich catchments, Northwest Territories, Canada
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract. Boreal peatlands are major catchment sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients and thus strongly regulate the landscape carbon balance, aquatic food webs, and downstream water quality. Climate change is likely to influence catchment solute yield directly through climatic controls on run-off generation, but also indirectly through altered disturbance regimes. In this study we monitored water chemistry from early spring until fall at the outlets of a 321 km2 catchment that burned 3 years prior to the study and a 134 km2 undisturbed catchment. Both catchments were located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada and had ∼ 60 % peatland cover. The two catchments had strong similarities in the timing of DOC and nutrient yields, but a few differences were consistent with anticipated effects of wildfire based on peatland porewater analysis. The 4-week spring period, particularly the rising limb of the spring freshet, was crucial for accurate characterization of the seasonal solute yield from both catchments. The spring period was responsible for ∼ 65 % of the seasonal DOC and nitrogen and for ∼ 85 % of the phosphorous yield. The rising limb of the spring freshet was associated with high phosphorous concentrations and DOC of distinctly high aromaticity and molecular weight. Shifts in stream DOC concentrations and aromaticity outside the early spring period were consistent with shifts in relative streamflow contribution from precipitation-like water in the spring to mineral soil groundwater in the summer, with consistent relative contributions from organic soil porewater. Radiocarbon content (14C) of DOC at the outlets was modern throughout May to September (fraction modern carbon, fM: 0.99–1.05) but likely reflected a mix of aged DOC, e.g. porewater DOC from permafrost (fM: 0.65–0.85) and non-permafrost peatlands (fM: 0.95–1.00), with modern bomb-influenced DOC, e.g. DOC leached from forest litter (fM: 1.05–1.10). The burned catchment had significantly increased total phosphorous (TP) yield and also had greater DOC yield during summer which was characterized by a greater contribution from aged DOC. Overall, however, our results suggest that DOC composition and yield from peatland-rich catchments in the discontinuous permafrost region likely is more sensitive to climate change through impacts on run-off generation rather than through altered fire regimes.

TI  - Distinct patterns of microbial metabolism associated to riverine dissolved organic carbon of different source and quality
PY  - 2015
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers contains a wide range of molecules that can be assimilated by microbes. However, there is today no integrated understanding of how the source and composition of this DOC regulate the extent to which the DOC can support microbial growth and respiration. We analyzed patterns in microbial metabolism of DOC from different streams and rivers in Quebec, by combining short-term bacterial production and respiration measurements with long-term DOC loss and analyses of bacterial use of different single substrates. We show that distinct metabolic patterns indeed exist across catchments, reflecting the varying nature and sources of the DOC. For example, DOC from forest headwaters systematically supported the highest bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that was recorded, while in contrast DOC in peat bog drainage was used with significantly lower BGE. The carbon consumption in clear mountain rivers, possibly represented by autochthonous algal DOC, supported the highest bacterial respiration rates and the highest long-term DOC losses. By using principle component analysis, we demonstrate how the major axes of variation in all of the measured metabolic responses are tightly connected to spectrofluorometrical DOC composition indicators and to isotopic indicators of DOC source. If causality is assumed, our results imply that changes in DOC supply from different sources, for example, caused by land use or climate change, should result in dramatic changes in the patterns of aquatic microbial metabolism and thus in altered aquatic ecosystem functioning, with likely consequences for food-web structures and greenhouse gas balances.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:list> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Arctic regions support a wide variety of freshwater ecosystems. These naturally oligotrophic and cold‐water streams, rivers, ponds and lakes are currently being impacted by a diverse range of anthropogenic pressures, such as accelerated climate change, permafrost thaw, land‐use change, eutrophication, brownification and the replacement of northern biota with the range expansion of more southern species.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Multiple stressors are rapidly changing Arctic freshwater systems as aquatic habitats are becoming more suitable for species originating from more southerly regions and thereby threatening biota adapted to cold waters.

We propose a three‐step approach to better address and facilitate monitoring of the rapid ecological changes that Arctic freshwater ecosystems are currently experiencing as a result of climate change. First, we should increase our efforts in the monitoring of freshwaters across all Arctic countries by setting up a network of monitoring sites and devoting more effort to a broad‐scale baseline survey using standardized methods. Second, we should enhance modelling efforts to include both ecological change and socio‐economic development. These models should help pinpoint species, ecosystems and geographical areas that are likely to show abrupt changes in response to any changes. Third, we should increase interaction among scientists, policymakers and different stakeholder groups. In particular, Indigenous Peoples must be involved in the leadership, planning and execution of monitoring and assessment activities of Arctic freshwaters. The proposed approach, which is critical to detecting the effects of climate change in the circumpolar region, has broader applications for global coordination of Arctic freshwater biomonitoring. Through routine monitoring, standardization of methods, enhanced modelling of integrated scientific and socio‐economic change, and increased collaboration within and among sectors, more effective monitoring and management of climate change impacts on freshwater biodiversity will be possible in the Arctic and globally.</jats:p></jats:list-item> </jats:list> </jats:p>

PY  - 2015
AB  - The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects terrestrial inputs on aquatic microbial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active microbial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies microbial community stability through functional not structural changes. Together, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The topics assessed in this chapter were last assessed by the IPCC in 2007, principally in WGII AR4 Chapters 3 (Kundzewicz et al., 2007) and 4 (Fischlin et al., 2007), but also in WGII AR4 Sections 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 (Rosenzweig et al., 2007). The WGII AR4 SPM stated “Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases,” though they noted that documentation of observed changes in tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere was sparse (Rosenzweig et al., 2007). Fischlin et al. (2007) found that 20 to 30% of the plant and animal species that had been assessed to that time were considered to be at increased risk of extinction if the global average temperature increase exceeds 2°C to 3°C above the preindustrial level with medium confidence, and that substantial changes in structure and functioning of terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems are very likely under that degree of warming and associated atmospheric CO2 concentration. No time scale was associated with these findings. The carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems were considered to be at high risk from climate change and land use change. The report warned that the capacity of ecosystems to adapt naturally to the combined effect of climate change and other stressors is likely to be exceeded if greenhouse gas (GHG) emission continued at or above the then-current rate.

TI  - The relative influences of climate and catchment processes on Holocene lake development in glaciated regions
PY  - 2013
AB  - Following deglaciation, the long-term pattern of change in diatom communities and the inferred history of the aquatic environment are affected by a hierarchy of environmental controls. These include direct climate impacts on a lake’s thermal and hydrologic budgets, as well as the indirect affects of climate on catchment processes, such as weathering, soil development, microbial activity, fire, and vegetation composition and productivity, which affect the transfer of solutes and particulates from the terrestrial ecosystem into the lake. Some of these catchment influences on lacustrine systems operate as time-dependent patterns of primary succession that are set in motion by glacier retreat. This paper provides a conceptual model of some dominant pathways of catchment influence on long-term lake development in glaciated regions and uses a series of paleolimnological examples from arctic, boreal, and temperate regions to evaluate the relative role of direct climate influences and of catchment processes in affecting the trajectory of aquatic ecosystems during the Holocene in different environmental contexts.

TI  - Holocene evolution of lakes in the forest-tundra biome of northern Manitoba, Canada
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The late-Quaternary paleoenvironmental history of the western Hudson Bay region of Subarctic Canada is poorly constrained. Here, we present a regional overview of the post-glacial history of eight lakes which span the forest-tundra biome in northern Manitoba. We show that during the penultimate drainage phase of Lake Agassiz the lake water had an estimated pH of ∼6.0, with abundant quillwort (Isoetes spp.) along the lakeshore and littoral zone and some floating green algae (Botryococcus spp. and Pediastrum sp.). Based on multiple sediment proxies, modern lake ontogeny in the region commenced at ∼7500 cal yrs BP. Pioneering diatom communities were shaped by the turbid, higher alkalinity lake waters which were influenced by base cation weathering of the surrounding till following Lake Agassiz drainage. By ∼7000 cal yrs BP, soil development and Picea spp. establish and the lakes began a slow trajectory of acidification over the remaining Holocene epoch. The natural acidification of the lakes in this region is slow, on the order of several millennia for one pH unit. Each of the study lakes exhibit relatively stable aquatic communities during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, suggesting this period is a poor analogue for modern climatic changes. During the Neoglacial, the beginning of the post-Little Ice Age period represents the most significant climatic event to impact the lakes of N. Manitoba. In the context of regional lake histories, the rate of diatom floristic change in the last 200–300 years is unprecedented, with the exception of post-glacial lake ontogeny in some of the lakes. For nearly the entire history of the lakes in this region, there is a strong linkage between landscape development and the aquatic ecosystems; however this relationship appears to become decoupled or less strong in the post-LIA period. Significant 20th century changes in the aquatic ecosystem cannot be explained wholly by changes in the terrestrial ecosystem, suggesting that future changes to the lakes of N. Manitoba will be strongly influenced by direct climatic effects to the lakes.

TI  - A Study of Sponge Symbionts from Different Light Habitats.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The amount of available light plays a key role in the growth and development of microbial communities. In the present study, we tested to what extent sponge-associated prokaryotic communities differed between specimens of the sponge species Cinachyrella kuekenthali and Xestospongia muta collected in dimly lit (caves and at greater depths) versus illuminated (shallow water) habitats. In addition to this, we also collected samples of water, sediment, and another species of Cinachyrella, C. alloclada. Overall, the biotope (sponge host species, sediment, and seawater) proved the major driver of variation in prokaryotic community composition. The light habitat, however, also proved a predictor of compositional variation in prokaryotic communities of both C. kuekenthali and X. muta. We used an exploratory technique based on machine learning to identify features (classes, orders, and OTUs), which distinguished X. muta specimens sampled in dimly lit versus illuminated habitat. We found that the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Rhodothermia and orders Puniceispirillales, Rhodospirillales, Rhodobacterales, and Thalassobaculales were associated with specimens from illuminated, i.e., shallow water habitat, while the classes Dehalococcoidia, Spirochaetia, Entotheonellia, Nitrospiria, Schekmanbacteria, and Poribacteria, and orders Sneathiellales and Actinomarinales were associated with specimens sampled from dimly lit habitat. There was, however, considerable variation within the different light habitats highlighting the importance of other factors in structuring sponge-associated bacterial communities.

TI  - The relative influence of land cover, hydrology, and in-stream processing on the composition of dissolved organic matter in boreal streams
PY  - 2015
AB  - Low-order boreal streams are particularly sensitive interfaces where dissolved organic matter (DOM) is transported from soils to inland waters. Disentangling the relative influence of key environmental factors suspected to influence stream water DOM composition is highly relevant to predicting the reactivity and fate of terrestrial DOM entering inland waters. Here we examined changes to DOM composition using absorbance and fluorescence, from 17 boreal streams ranging from first to fourth orders, over 14 months, including the rarely studied winter season, and two snowmelt periods (n = 836). We also analyzed soil pore water samples from three forest soil lysimeters to a depth of 70 cm (n = 60). Of five identified fluorescing parallel factor analysis components, two (C4 and C5) expressed a clear mire wetland or forest signature, providing distinct molecular markers of dominant land cover. In fact, land cover alone explained 49% of the variability in DOM composition. In contrast, seasonal fluctuations in hydrology only contributed to minor shifts (8%) in the composition of stream water DOM, while in-stream transformations to DOM composition were undetectable. These findings suggest that low-order boreal streams act as a passive pipe, since in-stream processing of DOM is restricted by short water residence times (6 h to 2 days). In addition, we demonstrated the sensitivity of optical approaches to distinguish between key terrestrial sources of DOM in the boreal landscape. By distinguishing the proportional leverage of key environmental controls on headwater stream DOM composition, we are better equipped to predict where and when key DOM transformations occur in the aquatic conduit.

TI  - Terrestrial organic matter support of lake food webs: Evidence from lake metabolism and stable hydrogen isotopes of consumers
PY  - 2012
AB  - We quantified the utilization of terrestrial organic matter (OM) in the food web of a humic lake by analyzing the metabolism and the consumers' stable isotopic (C, H, N) composition in benthic and pelagic habitats. Terrestrial OM inputs (3 g C m(-2) d(-1)) to the lake greatly exceeded autochthonous OM production (3 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) in the lake. Heterotrophic bacterial growth (19 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and community respiration (115 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) were high relative to algal photosynthesis and were predominantly (> 85%) supported by terrestrial OM in both habitats. Consequently, terrestrial OM fueled most (85%) of the total production at the base of the lake's food web (i.e., the sum of primary and bacterial production). Despite the uncertainties of quantitatively estimating resource use based on stable isotopes, terrestrial OM clearly also supported around half the zooplankton (47%), macrozoobenthos (63%), and fish (57%) biomass. These results indicate that, although rates of terrestrial OM inputs were around three orders of magnitude greater than that of autochthonous OM production, the use of the two resources by higher trophic levels was roughly equal. The disproportionally low reliance on terrestrial OM at higher trophic levels, compared with its high rates of input and high support of basic biomass production in the lake, suggests that autochthonous resources could not be completely replaced by terrestrial resources and indicates an upper limit to terrestrial support of lake food webs.

TI  - Environmental Impacts—Lake Ecosystems
PY  - 2016
AB  - The North Sea region contains a vast number of lakes; from shallow, highly eutrophic water bodies in agricultural areas to deep, oligotrophic systems in pristine high-latitude or high-altitude areas. These freshwaters and the biota they contain are highly vulnerable to climate change. As largely closed systems, lakes are ideally suited to studying climate-induced effects via changes in ice cover, hydrology and temperature, as well as via biological communities (phenology, species and size distribution, food-web dynamics, life-history traits, growth and respiration, nutrient dynamics and ecosystem metabolism). This chapter focuses on change in natural lakes and on parameters for which their climate-driven responses have major impacts on ecosystem properties such as productivity, community composition, metabolism and biodiversity. It also points to the importance of addressing different temporal scales and variability in driving and response variables along with threshold-driven responses to environmental forces. Exceedance of critical thresholds may result in abrupt changes in particular elements of an ecosystem. Modelling climate-driven physical responses like ice-cover duration, stratification periods and thermal profiles in lakes have shown major advances, and the chapter provide recent achievements in this field for northern lakes. Finally, there is a tentative summary of the level of certainty for key climatic impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Wherever possible, data and examples are drawn from the North Sea region.

TI  - Lake-wide physical and biological trends associated with warming in Lake Baikal
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Eutrophication and warming of lakes are occurring globally. Lake Baikal, a large ancient lake composed of three basins, has recently experienced benthic eutrophication at local sites and lake warming in the south basin. Here, we look for signals of warming and pelagic eutrophication across the entire lake using physical and biological data collected at a subset of 79 stations sampled ca. annually (1977–2003) during the period of summer stratification. Lake-wide, surface waters warmed 2.0 °C; and, consistent with this warming, the abundance of two warm-water, cosmopolitan zooplankton taxa increased between two (pelagic cladocerans) and 12-fold (Cyclops kolensis). C. kolensis increased throughout the lake, whereas cladocerans increased significantly only in the north basin. In contrast, abundance of the cold-water endemic copepod, Epischura baikalensis, that dominates the crustacean zooplankton community, did not change. With the exception of one coastal station in the north basin, there is no evidence of pelagic eutrophication. Although chlorophyll concentrations increased 46% lake-wide (0.82 to 1.20 μg/L), the increasing trend was significant only in the south basin. Surprisingly, mean Secchi transparency increased by 1.4 m lake-wide across the 26-year time series with significant deepening of water transparency occurring in the central and north basins. This suggests a decline in productivity in the north and middle basins, but an increase in the south basin. Taken together, these findings suggest that physical and biological changes associated with warming have occurred in Lake Baikal, but wide-spread pelagic eutrophication in the lake's three basins has not.

TI  - Food sources and lipid retention of zooplankton in subarctic ponds
PY  - 2011
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Subarctic ponds are seasonal aquatic habitats subject to short summers but often have surprisingly numerous planktonic consumers relative to phytoplankton productivity. Because subarctic ponds have low pelagic productivity but a high biomass of benthic algae, we hypothesised that benthic mats provide a complementary and important food source for the zooplankton. To test this, we used a combination of fatty acid and stable isotope analyses to evaluate the nutritional content of benthic and pelagic food and their contributions to the diets of crustacean zooplankton in 10 Finnish subarctic ponds. 2. Benthic mats and seston differed significantly in total lipids, with seston (62.5 l gm g )1 ) having approximately eight times higher total lipid concentrations than benthic mats (7.0 l gm g )1 ). Moreover, the two potential food sources differed in their lipid quality, with benthic organic matter completely lacking some nutritionally important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), most notably docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid. 3. Zooplankton had higher PUFA concentrations (27–67 l gm g )1 ) than either of the food sources (mean benthic mats: 1.2 l gm g )1 ; mean seston: 9.9 l gm g )1 ), indicating that zooplankton metabolically regulate their accumulation of PUFA. In addition, when each pond was evaluated independently, the zooplankton was consistently more 13 C-depleted (d 13 C )20 to )33&) than seston ()23 to )29&) or benthic ()15 to )27&) food sources. In three ponds, a subset of the zooplankton (Eudiaptomus graciloides, Bosmina sp., Daphnia sp. and Branchinecta paludosa) showed evidence of feeding on both benthic and planktonic resources, whereas in most (seven out of 10) ponds the zooplankton appeared to feed primarily on plankton. 4. Our results indicate that pelagic primary production was consistently the principal food resource of most metazoans. While benthic mats were highly productive, they did not appear to be a major food source for zooplankton. The pond zooplankton, faced by strong seasonal food limitation, acquires particular dietary elements selectively.

TI  - Interactive effects of light and snail herbivory rather than nutrient loading determine early establishment of submerged macrophytes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Submerged macrophytes play a key role in maintaining a clear-water phase and promoting biodiversity in shallow aquatic ecosystems. Since their abundance has declined globally due to anthropogenic activities, it is important to include them in aquatic ecosystem restoration programs. Macrophytes establishment in early spring is crucial for the subsequent growth of other warm-adapted macrophytes. However, factors affecting this early establishment of submerged macrophytes have not been fully explored yet. Here, we conducted an outdoor experiment from winter to early spring using the submerged macrophytes <i>Potamogeton crispus</i> and <i>Vallisneria spinulosa</i> to study the effects of shading, nutrient loading, snail herbivory (<i>Radix swinhoei</i>), and their interactions on the early growth and stoichiometric characteristics of macrophytes. The results show that the effects strongly depend on macrophyte species. Biomass and number of shoots of <i>P. crispus</i> decreased, and internode length increased during low light conditions, but were not affected by nutrient loading. <i>P. crispus</i> shoot biomass and number showed hump-shaped responses to increased snail biomass under full light. In contrast, the biomass of the plant linearly decreased with snail biomass under low light. This indicates an interaction of light with snail herbivory. Since snails prefer grazing on periphyton over macrophytes, a low density of snails promoted growth of <i>P. crispus</i> by removing periphyton competition, while herbivory on the macrophyte increased during a high density of snails. The growth of <i>V. spinulosa</i> was not affected by any of the factors, probably because of growth limitation by low temperature. Our study demonstrates that the interaction of light with snail herbivory may affect establishment and growth of submerged macrophytes in early spring. Macrophyte restoration projects may thus benefit from lowering water levels to increase light availability and making smart use of cold-adapted herbivores to reduce light competition with periphyton.

TI  - Recent palaeolimnological change recorded in Lake Xiaolongwan, northeast China: Climatic versus anthropogenic forcing
PY  - 2013
AB  - Lake Xiaolongwan is a closed maar lake located in the Long Gang Volcanic Field, northeast China. Core XLW2 was collected in 2007 from the central region of the lake and provides a palaeoecological reconstruction over the past ca. 130 years (dated using radiometric methods: 210Pb and 137Cs). Diatom floristic changes and catchment productivity (carbon isotope ratios) were analysed within the core. Indicators of atmospheric pollution (XRF and SCP inventories) were also measured. Results show a marked transition from a dominant benthic assemblage to a planktonic one (increasing P:B ratios) starting after ca. 1940 AD, becoming most prominent after ca. 1980 AD (P:B > 1). Most notable floristic changes result from the increase in the planktonic species Discostella woltereckii. These changes are concomitant with increased temperature trends from the region and reconstructed temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. SCP concentrations and flux rates also increase after ca. 1950 AD, with highest values seen at ca. 1980 AD after which values decline. Normalised elemental geochemistry (e.g. Pb/Ti) also show marked changes after ca. 1970 AD, most likely derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb. The recent increase in D. woltereckii precedes anthropogenic contamination (Pb/Ti) at the site and persists after the decline in SCP concentrations. This suggests that the recent increases are driven by increased mean annual temperature trends. These temperature trends may be manifested as changes in ice cover persistence, a longer growing season and/or increased DOC at Lake Xiaolongwan: conditions for which planktonic species have a more competitive advantage.

TI  - Intra-annual variability of natural organic matter in boreal streams
PY  - 2013
AB  - Natural organic matter (NOM) is a key component in aquatic ecosystems. It influences for example acidity, mobility and toxicity of metals and organic pollutants, energy input to aquatic food webs, weathering, and water light conditions. There are also considerable costs associated with removing NOM in drinking water production. Furthermore, NOM is an integral part of the carbon cycle with possible indirect effects on climate. During recent decades, there have been observations of increasing concentrations of NOM in surface waters in parts of North America and Europe. The causes of these trends are not fully understood, but are thought to be related to climate change and recovery from anthropogenic acidification. This thesis presents results from studies on intra-annual NOM cycling in more than 130 boreal streams and rivers. It also presents developments of the Riparian flow-concentration Integration Model (RIM). Detailed studies on five forested headwater catchments revealed that stream discharge and soil temperature were the main drivers of NOM variability. In addition, a small headwater catchment at the Swedish West Coast was substantially influenced by sea-salt deposition, which suppressed NOM mobilization. A modified version of RIM with discharge and soil temperature as variables could successfully simulate NOM dynamics in all five catchments. Riparian soil organic matter content and distribution was hypothesized to be the underlying control on NOM response to discharge and soil temperature. Catchments where NOM was sensitive to discharge displayed stronger gradients in soil NOM concentrations than did catchments with weak discharge sensitivity. A large scale study of 136 streams and rivers indicated common relationships among NOM, discharge and temperature. Conversely, there was no geographical pattern in NOM trends. Relative trends were weakly related to NOM response to flow and temperature. There were also clear relationships among intra-annual NOM dynamics, temperature, flow, and catchment landscape characteristics, indicating that catchments can be classified based on NOM dynamics. Taken together, this implies that NOM dynamics could change in ways not reflected in inter-annual trends due to climate change.

TI  - Declining Summertime pCO2 in Tundra Lakes in a Granitic Landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As climate change accelerates, positive feedback loops could establish between atmospheric warming and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural ecosystems. Of particular interest are high‐latitude environments, many of which contain large stores of organic carbon and have experienced decades of accelerated warming. Freshwater ecosystems situated in carbon‐rich Arctic landscapes are predicted to respond to warming with higher respiration rates relative to primary production rates, increasing their carbon dioxide partial pressure (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and thus CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions to the atmosphere. However, large areas of shallow soil/bedrock occur in Arctic and sub‐Arctic regions and could respond differently due to the lower availability of stored carbon. Here, we used pH and alkalinity to calculate 23 years (1994–2017) of summertime (July and August) <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes for 19 sub‐Arctic tundra lakes located on the shallow‐bedrock granitic Canadian Shield in Nunavut, Canada, and found a significant decline in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Regional precipitation did not change over this period, yet dramatic increases in pH, conductivity, and total alkalinity indicated that longer ice‐free periods and changes in primary production, both functions of accelerated climate warming at higher latitudes, may be suppressing lacustrine CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Northern lakes overlying differing geological landscapes may thus be responding in contrasting ways in terms of <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes, with potential major implications for regional carbon budgets and predicted climate change feedbacks.</jats:p>

TI  - Optical characteristics and factors that influence representative Lakes in the Taihu Lake basin, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - From 2018 to 2019, a survey of a typical lakes system in the Taihu Lake basin, China, was carried out. To provide reference values for the restoration and management of submerged vegetation in the lakes, the optical attenuation coefficient (Kd) and euphotic depth (Zeu) of the water body were calculated, and the distribution characteristics and factors that influenced the underwater optical field lands with different nutrition levels in the basin were analyzed. The main factor affecting the distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in lakes in the Taihu Lake basin is suspended solids (SS), dominated by inorganic suspended matter (ISS). Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) all affect, although weakly, the optical characteristics of lake wetlands. In CDOM, humic-like components have a more significant impact on Kd. The Kd of lakes in the Taihu Lake basin is closely related to permanganate index (CODMn) and especially total phosphorus (TP); The growth of aquatic vegetation is increased in Shanghu, Dianshan-Yuandang, Yangcheng, and Wuli Lakes that have higher Zeu and Zeu/Depth values.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon and unimodal variation in sexual signal coloration in mosquitofish: a role for light limitation?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Natural selection plays an important role in the evolution of sexual communication systems. Here, we assess the effect of two well-known selection agents, transmission environment and predation, on interpopulation variation in sexual signals. Our model system is a series of 21 populations of Bahamian mosquitofish subjected to independent variation in optical conditions and predation risk. We show that optically diverse environments, caused by locally variable dissolved organic carbon concentrations, rather than spatial variation in predation, drove divergence in fin coloration (fin redness). We found a unimodal pattern of phenotypic variation along the optical gradient indicating a threshold-type response of visual signals to broad variation in optical conditions. We discuss evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that may drive such a pattern as well as the implications of non-monotonic clines for evolutionary differentiation.

TI  - Effects of Added Humic Substances and Nutrients on Photochemical Degradation of Dissolved Organic Matter in a Mesocosm Amendment Experiment in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Humic substances, a component of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM), contribute to dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) in coastal waters, and have significant impacts on biogeochemistry. There are concerns in recent years over browning effects in surface waters due to increasing tDOM inputs, and their negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems, but relatively little work has been published on estuaries and coastal waters. Photodegradation could be a significant sink for tDOM in coastal environments, but the rates and efficiencies are poorly constrained. We conducted large-scale DOM photodegradation experiments in mesocosms amended with humic substances and nutrients in the Gulf of Finland to investigate the potential of photochemistry to remove added tDOM and the interactions of DOM photochemistry with eutrophication. The added tDOM was photodegraded rapidly, as CDOM absorption decreased and spectral slopes increased with increasing photons absorbed in laboratory experiments. The in situ DOM optical properties became similar among the control, humic- and humic+nutrients-amended mesocosm samples toward the end of the amendment experiment, indicating degradation of the excess CDOM/DOM through processes including photodegradation. Nutrient additions did not significantly influence the effects of added humic substances on CDOM optical property changes, but induced changes in DOM removal.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter concentration, optical parameters and attenuation of solar radiation in high-latitude lakes across three vegetation zones
PY  - 2015
AB  - ABSTRACT High-latitude lakes are usually transparent, due to their low productivity and low concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but large variations in lake optical properties can be found within and between regions. We investigated the light regimes in relation to DOM in 18 oligotrophic, high-latitude lakes across mountain birch woodland, shrub tundra and barren tundra in north-west Finnish Lapland. In 12 lakes >1% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reached the lake bottom, while 1% UV-B depth ranged from 0.1 to >12 m. Lakes located in barren tundra had highest transparency, lowest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and lowest DOM absorption (a440) (mean values: Kd PAR 0.3m-1, DOC 2.1mg l-1, a440 0.4m-1), while lakes in shrub tundra and mountain birch forest were less transparent (DOC 4.7 mg l-1, a440 1.4 m-1). Solar attenuation and lake transparency was best explained by a440. Our survey emphasizes the importance of catchment type on DOM characteristics and lake optics. ...

TI  - Effects of water browning on freshwater biodiversity: the case of the predatory phantom midge Chaoborus nyblaei
PY  - 2018
AB  - Water browning, due to increased runoff of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC), has recently gained considerable attention. While it is well settled how browning affects light regime and thereby aquatic primary production, other impacts on the aquatic biota is less explored. Water browning shelters against UV radiation, and may thus benefit range expansion of UV sensitive organisms, such as midges. We mapped occurrence of Chaoborids in 148 subalpine and alpine ponds in Norway, and identified an apparent threshold for their presence around 3 mg total organic carbon (TOC) l−1. The field study was complemented with laboratory experiments on Chaoborus nyblaei (Zetterstedt, 1838), to test if this species is able to identify and select water colour (concentrations of DOC) for oviposition. Number of egg rafts on brown water tanks was significantly higher than in clear water tanks, indicating that C. nyblaei performs oviposition habitat selection. Chaoborids are effective predators in planktonic habitats, and our findings support the hypothesis that climate change may cascade through the ecosystem and promote range shifts of species due to alternated habitat frame conditions.

TI  - Lake trout growth is sensitive to spring temperature in southwest Alaska lakes
PY  - 2020
AB  - In high-latitude lakes, air temperature is an important driver of ice cover thickness and duration, which in turn influence water temperature and primary production supporting lake consumers and predators. In lieu of multidecadal observational records necessary to assess the response of lakes to long-term warming, we used otolith-based growth records from a long-lived resident lake fish, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), as a proxy for production. Lake trout were collected from seven deep, oligotrophic lakes in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve on in southwest Alaska that varied in the presence of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) from anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Linear mixed-effects models were used to partition variation in lake trout growth by age and calendar-year and model comparisons tested for a mean increase in lake trout growth with sockeye salmon presence. Year effects from the best mixed-effects model were subsequently compared to indices of temperature, lake ice, and regional indices of sockeye salmon escapement. A strong positive correlation between annual lake trout growth and temperature suggested that warmer springs, earlier lake ice break-up, and a longer ice-free growing season increase lake trout growth via previously identified bottom-up increases in production with warming. Accounting for differences in the presence or annual escapement of sockeye salmon with available data did not improve model fit. Collectively with other studies, the results suggest that productivity of subarctic lakes has benefitted from warming spring temperatures and that temperature can synchronise otolith growth across lakes with and without sockeye salmon MDN.

TI  - Mineralization of autochthonous particulate organic carbon is a fast channel of organic matter turnover in Germany's largest drinking water reservoir
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Turnover of organic matter (OM) is an essential ecological function in inland water bodies and relevant for water quality. This is especially important for the potential of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal as well as for emissions of CO2. In this study, we investigated various phases of OM including DOC, autochthonous particulate organic carbon (auto-POC), allochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-POC), and sedimentary matter (SED) in a temperate drinking water reservoir (Rappbode Reservoir, Germany) by means of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and carbon stable isotope ratios. In order to best outline carbon turnover, we focused on the metalimnion and the hypolimnion of the reservoir, where respiration is expected to be dominant and hardly disturbed by atmospheric exchange or photosynthesis. DIC concentrations ranged between 0.30 and 0.53 mmol L−1, while δ13CDIC values ranged between −15.1 ‰ and −7.2 ‰ versus the VPDB (Vienna PeeDee Belemnite) standard. Values of δ13CDOC and δ13Cauto-POC ranged between −28.8 ‰ and −27.6 ‰ and between −35.2 ‰ and −26.8 ‰, respectively. Isotope compositions of sedimentary material and allochthonous POC were inferred from the literature and from measurements from previous studies with δ13CSED=-31.1 ‰ and δ13Callo-POC ranging from −31.8 ‰ to −28.6 ‰. Comparison of DIC concentration gains and stable isotope mass balances showed that auto-POC from primary producers was the main contributor to increases in the DIC pool. Calculated OM turnover rates (0.01 to 1.3 µmol L−1 d−1) were within the range for oligotrophic water bodies. Some higher values in the metalimnion are likely due to increased availability of settling auto-POC from the photic zone. Samples from a metalimnetic oxygen minimum (MOM) also showed dominance of respiration over photosynthesis. Our work shows that respiration in temperate lentic water bodies largely depends on auto-POC production as a major carbon source. Such dependencies can influence the vulnerabilities of these aqueous systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Water chemistry and physical gradients across the coastal band of eastern Georgian Bay: A coherent habitat template
PY  - 2023
AB  - The 125 km long archipelago of islands, reefs and embayments composing the coastline of eastern Georgian Bay connects the adjacent watersheds of the Canadian Shield with the calcareous basin of Lake Huron resulting in gradients of nutrients, major ions, alkalinity-pH, DOC and water transparency. An investigation of the broad distribution of these gradients, extending over four regions of coastline and the 60 km of shoreline from 2014 to 2016 indicated that this onshore-offshore transition in water quality is a predictable feature of the nearshore stemming from the underlying geological transition from land to lake. Consolidating the onshore to offshore gradient is the quasi-channelized nature of mixing across the highly dissected coastal band that adds to the persistence of mixing areas. In addition to water quality, the coastal gradient also encompasses a broad range of physical attributes of the aquatic environment including the thermal, optical, exposure regimes and the physical character of lakebed substrate. Consequently, we hypothesize that diverse forms of aquatic life can be anticipated to select and preferentially distribute across the habitat template embodied by the gradients that span the coastal band of eastern Georgian Bay.
