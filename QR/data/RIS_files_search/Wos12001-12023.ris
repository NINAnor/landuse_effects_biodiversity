AB  - Understanding and quantification of phosphorus (P) fluxes are key requirements for predictions of future forest ecosystems changes as well as for transferring lessons learned from natural ecosystems to croplands and plantations. This review summarizes and evaluates the recent knowledge on mechanisms, magnitude, and relevance by which dissolved and colloidal inorganic and organic P forms can be translocated within or exported from forest ecosystems. Attention is paid to hydrological pathways of P losses at the soil profile and landscape scales, and the subsequent influence of P on aquatic ecosystems. New (unpublished) data from the German Priority Program 1685 Ecosystem Nutrition: Forest Strategies for limited Phosphorus Resources were added to provide up-to-date flux-based information. Nitrogen (N) additions increase the release of water-transportable P forms. Most P found in percolates and pore waters belongs to the so-called dissolved organic P (DOP) fractions, rich in orthophosphate-monoesters and also containing some orthophosphate-diesters. Total solution P concentrations range from ca. 1 to 400 mu g P L-1, with large variations among forest stands. Recent sophisticated analyses revealed that large portions of the DOP in forest stream water can comprise natural nanoparticles and fine colloids which under extreme conditions may account for 40-100% of the P losses. Their translocation within preferential flow passes may be rapid, mediated by storm events. The potential total P loss through leaching into subsoils and with streams was found to be less than 50 mg P m(-2) a(-1), suggesting effects on ecosystems at centennial to millennium scale. All current data are based on selected snapshots only. Quantitative measurements of P fluxes in temperate forest systems are nearly absent in the literature, probably due to main research focus on the C and N cycles. Therefore, we lack complete ecosystem-based assessments of dissolved and colloidal P fluxes within and from temperate forest systems.

AB  - The frequency and severity of drought are expected to increase due to climate change; therefore, selection of tree species for afforestation should consider drought resistance of the species for maximum survival and conservation of natural habitats. In this study, three soil moisture regimes: control (100% precipitation), mild drought (40% reduction in precipitation), and severe drought (80% reduction in precipitation) were applied to six gymnosperm and five angiosperm species for two consecutive years. We quantified the drought resistance index based on the root collar diameter and assessed the correlation between species drought resistance and other morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits by regression analysis. The prolonged drought stress altered the morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits, but the responses were species-specific. The species with high drought resistance had high leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic rate (Pn), and midday leaf water potential (psi MD), and low carbon isotopic discrimination (513C), flavonoid and polyphenol content, superoxide dismutase and DPPH radical scavenging activity. The highly drought-resistant species had a relatively less decrease in leaf size, Pn, and predawn leaf water potential (psi PD), and less increase in 513C, abscisic acid and sucrose content, and LMA compared to the control. The interannual variation in drought resistance (delta Rd) was positively correlated with the species hydroscopic slope (isohydric and anisohydric). Korean pine was highly resistant, sawtooth oak, hinoki cypress, East Asian white birch, East Asian ash, and mono maple were highly susceptible, and Korean red pine, Japanese larch, Sargent cherry, needle fir, and black pine were moderate in drought resistance under long-term drought. These findings will help species selection for afforestation programs and es-tablishment of sustainable forests, especially of drought-tolerant species, under increased frequency and inten-sity of spring and summer droughts.

AB  - The Arctic zone of the Russian Federation is one of the most intensively developing regions of the country. Amongst the major domains of economic and industrial growth and improvement is transport infrastructure and particularly the railway network. This area is being exposed to negative factors of rapid climate change that can significantly affect and compromise this activity. Thus, it is vital to take them into account during design, construction, and operation of the railway infrastructure facilities. This work details the production of a digital atlas comprising the 1950-2021 dynamics of the main hydrometeorological parameters: air and soil temperature, precipitation, wind speed, air and soil humidity, and snow cover thickness. The maps are based on climatic data derived from the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) reanalysis. In total there are 459, which are arranged into 7 chapters. The atlas geographically covers the western part of the Russian Arctic encompassing the regions of quite intensive transport development, which includes the construction of the Northern Latitudinal Railway. Original algorithms of geospatial data processing and their further representation as well as the maps compiled in GIS environment are discussed. Comprehensive analysis of climatic changes in the region of the Russian Arctic including detailed quantitative evaluation over 40 years is given. In the Discussion, we focus on those changes of the regional climate which, from our point of view, are the most significant for consideration by railway operators. The obtained results contribute to framing the theoretical basis of design, development, and sustainable operation of the railway infrastructure in the Arctic and facilitate the decision-making process. This is the first experience of building a specialized climatic cartographic product for the needs of the Russian railways, and to our knowledge the first atlas such as that in the world. In the future, the amassed experience may be transferred to other regions of the Russian Federation as well as similar regions in Canada, Sweden and Highland China that are also subject to significant climate change.

AB  - There are many initiatives in the market capable to assess some aspects of sustainability for roads (mainly environmental). For instance, in America it should be noted the Greenroads, Envision and Invest certification systems. In Europe, it must be highlighted some sustainability assessment systems such as Ceequal in UK as well as rating and awards scheme for civil engineering or many tools to evaluate CO2 and Carbon Footprint, for example, the Dutch CO2 Performance Ladder.
   However, a complete evaluation of sustainability has not been implemented yet as a consequence of that some approaches do not cover all life cycle phases or all sustainability pillars. What is more, there is a lack of regulation in terms of a framework for sustainability assessment of civil constructions, for instance, CENTC 350 is still under development In addition, there are regional peculiarities which are not always considered in the evaluation systems and sometimes there are some stakeholders refusing the idea of road comparison. The EC by means of the Joint Research Centre (DG-JRC) is developing the Green Public Procurement Criteria (GPP) for design, construction and maintenance of roads, as useful method for the pre-selection criteria for contractors and for ensuring compliance of performance.
   This paper summarizes the new sustainability certification system for roads named "LCE4ROADS", under development as part of the FP7 project: "Life Cycle Engineering approach to develop a novel EU-harmonized sustainability certification system for cost-effective, safer and greener road infrastructures".
   LCE4ROADS will integrate by a Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) approach, all the aspects of sustainability (Environmental, Economic, Social, Technical) to asses roads projects and works (both new construction and rehabilitation/maintenance) with the final goal of creating a holistic and EU-harmonized methodology to increase the sustainability roads.
   The certification system developed is based on current EN and ISO standards for sustainability in construction (EN15804) and LCA and LCC (ISO 14040-44 and ISO15686) and considers previous developments from other research projects like MIRAVEC, EVITA, COST 354 among others.
   Key aspects at European level like the adaptation and resilience to Climate Change and the implementation of freight corridors (the so called TEN-T: Trans European Transport Network) will be considered in this new certification system. With the goal of refining the certification system and the parameters and key performance indicators to be considered, it should be mentioned that LCE4ROADS has been already presented to different key stakeholders such as:
   National and Regional Road Authorities in six EU countries (France, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Poland) and in Turkey (The Turkish Ministry of Transport (KGM) is partner of the FP7 Project).
   The European Commission (DG Research, DG Environment, DG JRC, and DG Move-Transport)
   Sectorial Platforms and Associations like the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), The European Road Federation (ERF), the Spanish Construction Technology Platform (mirror of the European ECTP) among others.
   The US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is also interested in this topic and is working closely to the FP7 project team (the EC selected the project to collaborate with the most important transport research center in America). The feedback received for future implementation from the key stakeholders has been taken into consideration to modify the scope of the certification system, the phases covered and the certification moments.
   This system, together with a guide for application and a multi-criteria software tool to be developed could be really useful for future procurement and GPP processes in Europe. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

CP  - 6th International Symposium on Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE)
AB  - From September 2016 to August 2018 a CEDR (Conference of European Directors of Roads) research has been conducted by the consortium INTERLINK into asset information management for European Roads life-cycle management using Linked Data. This research aims to improve interoperability between the European National Road Authorities (NRAs) and their stakeholders, mainly to explore the procurement of road asset information by NRAs for better operations, asset management and project management, to investigate suitable data structures for asset information, including BIM and GIS, to develop common principles for a European Road object type library (OTL) and to design and test a basic European Road OTL connected to open BIM/GIS standards. The CEDR INTERLINK project will design a managed European Road OTL as the basis of a common language to be used for developing high quality national Road OTLs for exchanging and sharing road asset data. This European Road OTL is supported by three pillars to optimize the success of subsequent implementation: 1. a quality open available standardized Technical Specification, 2. a suitable and sustainable Standardization Body, with a plan for development beyond this project and 3. acceptance in practice by the industry through engagement and dissemination. First the business and data needs have been investigated by INTERLINK through a literature review, interviews with stakeholders (NRAs, contractors, consultants, suppliers, academics, software developers and standardization initiatives in Europe) and an industry survey, which resulted in a approach for the European Road OTL. The common principles, based on the requirements, describe a hybrid solution, with semantically-rich data referencing more traditional document-based information, combining the strengths of currently applied BIM/GIS standards with Linked Data /SemanticWeb technology. The proof-of-concept European Road OTL is tested via three trial cases, which demonstrated data transfers representing typical processes during assets' life-cycles in three European countries: Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands. A road map is delivered for development and implementation of the Road OTL from document based to object based road information management based on the European Road OTL open standard using Linked Data.

AB  - Background Since 2002, Afghanistan has made much effort to achieve universal health coverage. According to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, target eight, the provision of quality care to all must include usually underserved groups, including people with disabilities. We investigated whether a decade of international investment in the Afghan health system has brought quality health care to this group.
   Methods We used data from two representative household surveys, one done in 2005 and one in 2013, in 13 provinces of Afghanistan, that included questions about activity limitations and functioning difficulties, socioeconomic factors, perceived availability of health care, and experience with coverage of health-care needs. We used multilevel modelling and tests for interaction to investigate factors associated with differences in perception between timepoints and whether village remoteness affected changes in perception.
   Findings The 2005 survey included 334 people, and the 2013 survey included 961 people. Mean age, employment, and asset levels of participants with disabilities increased slightly between 2005 and 2013, but the level of education decreased. Formal education and higher asset level were associated with improved availability of health care and positive experience with coverage of health-care needs, whereas being employed was only associated with the latter. Perceived availability of health care and positive experience with coverage of health-care needs significantly worsened in 2013 compared with in 2005 (227 [69%] perceived that services were available in 2005 vs 405 [44%] in 2013, p<0.0001; 255 [78%] perceived a positive experience in 2005 vs 410 [45%] in 2013, p<0.0001). Village remoteness increased in 2013 (no connectivity by paved road 186 [57%] in 2005 vs 797 [87%] in 2013, p<0.0001; mean time to reach health-care facility 64.3 min [SD 167.7] vs 84.4 min [107.7], p<0.0001) and negatively affected perception of health-care availability.
   Interpretation Perceived availability of health care and experience with health-care coverage have not greatly improved for people with disabilities in Afghanistan, particularly in remote areas. Health policy in Afghanistan will need to address attitudinal, social, and accessibility barriers to health care.

AB  - Key message We present a methodological framework that both scientists and supply chain actors can mobilise to organise information at different scales of observation, and further make informed decisions regarding the supply and extraction of bio-molecules from forest biomass. We demonstrate its usefulness for extracting bio-molecules contained in silver fir growing in France. Context Numerous bio-active molecules can be extracted from trees at an industrial scale. Supply chain actors play a central role in this emerging bio-economy. However, they do not have enough information and tools to make informed decisions with respect to species, growing locations, or identities of potential suppliers of relevant wood biomass. Aims We explore and demonstrate an information chain and methodological framework that can help make three critical decisions regarding the selection of (1) the species containing the desired bio-molecules, (2) the locations where the resource is collected, and (3) the supply chain partners and types of industrial wood by-products necessary to obtain sufficient biomass for industrial extraction. Methods The methodological framework provides detailed guidelines and references to select the right combination of sampling protocol, allometric models, chemical analyses, GIS tools, and forest growth and supply chain models in order to produce information for the three decision steps within various regional contexts. Results We apply the framework within the context of supply chain actors who are interested in estimating the quantity and diversity of bio-molecules contained in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) growing in the Grand Est region of France. We show how conflicting environmental, legal and economic constraints can affect the results. We discuss future challenges that need to be tackled to improve the methodological framework. Conclusion This study represents a highly detailed overview of the potential bio-molecules contained in a tree species, from its natural habitat or plantation to the end of the regional supply chain. It also represents a step towards the development of a generic knowledge infrastructure and methodology that is necessary to solve various decision-making problems regarding the industrial supply and extraction of high-value bio-molecules.

AB  - The article seeks to develop a nuanced understanding of the contradictory approaches EU political elites have taken regarding the problem of forced migration, which intensified as a result of the 2015 migration crisis. To do so, the authors analyze the content of judicial disputes between the European Commission and the Visegrad Group countries concerning refugee distribution quotas, identify the main disagreements among the major European political actors which developed as a result of their different approaches to forced migration, and demonstrate the current state of affairs in this sphere from the decision-making perspective. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the legal arguments presented by these parties before the European Court of Justice, and come to a conclusion about the political nature of this conflict. Plaintiffs and defendants do not merely interpret the acquis communautaire differently - they have diametrically opposed views on the contents of the problem of forced migration. As for attitudes towards how refugees are received, the "power landscape" within the EU is determined by the confrontation between the liberal and conservative centers; the former is represented somewhat arbitrarily by Brussels (being home to the European Commission and the European Court of Justice), as well as by the leadership of Germany and Sweden, whereas the latter is composed of the governments of the Visegrad Group and Italy. Several states tend to lean toward one of these two sides. However, most EU member states do not hold an extreme position on the issue of refugees, preferring instead to fluctuate between these two principles. On the one hand, they are committed to humanistic values and pan-European solidarity; on the other hand, protecting national sovereignty and security is important to them. This contradiction manifests itself both in the vagueness of their leaders' public rhetoric and in the endless delay and half-hearted character of their decisions. Having analyzed the behavior and policies of these national governments over the past four years, the authors found that all major players within the EU are quite willing to compromise. This suggests that there is no threat of the EU collapsing under the pressure of the contradictions caused by migration.

AB  - BackgroundEnergy citizenship has emerged as a concept which attempts to capture the new role envisaged for urban citizens as engaged and active in the energy transition. However, exactly how to successfully engage energy citizens requires more research and this article aims to contribute to this knowledge gap. The article presents a new methodology, 'Walking with Energy', which seeks to (re)connect citizens with where their energy is coming from. By experimenting with the application of this method in the UK and Sweden, we consider how viewing and talking about heating provision, while in the energy landscape, can encourage participants to reflect upon their local, mundane energy experiences and foster a greater sense of energy citizenship and greater motivation to engage with debates around heating transition.ResultsThe article presents four different events: (1) a physical walk to an energy recovery facility, (2) a walk to view a building's heat exchanger, (3) a round-table discussion using pictures to communicate in a language cafe, and (4) a virtual tour around an Energy Recovery Facility. The way we conducted the events influenced who engaged, for example: the walk through a heat facility and the walk to visit a heat exchanger in the basement of a University building tended to attract white middle-class people, while the virtual tour attracted a more mixed audience in terms of age and background, but most had a strong environmental interest. The language cafe targeted immigrants. The different events resulted in many similar reflections, but there was also variation. For example, the walk through the heat facility generated the most focused and least diverse reflections, while the event focussed on the heat exchanger opened up a wide range of issues for discussion.ConclusionsWe find that the method encouraged the sharing of personal experiences, storytelling, and deepened the engagement of participants with debates about energy. The method can help promote energy democracy and boost a deliberative dialogue about present and future energy systems among citizens. We also learnt that promotion of energy citizenship requires not only active citizens but also active facilitation to create opportunities for citizens to engage and reflect.

AB  - As a result of regulatory decisions, atmospheric deposition of most toxic metals and metalloids (MEs) has decreased in Europe over the past few decades. However, little is known about how this reduction translates into exposure at higher trophic levels in the terrestrial environment where temporal trends may be spatially heterogeneous due to local current or legacy sources of emissions (e.g., industry) or long-range transport of elements (e.g., marine transport). The aim of this study was to characterize temporal and spatial trends of exposure to MEs in terrestrial food webs using a predatory bird, the tawny owl Strix aluco, as a biomonitor. Toxic (Al, As, Cd, Hg, Pb) and essential/beneficial (B, Co, Cu, Mn, Se) elemental concentrations were measured in feathers of nest-captured females from 1986 to 2016, extending a previous study published over the time-series 1986-2005 (n = 1051), in a breeding population in Norway. A drastic decline over time was shown for the toxic MEs (-97 % for Pb, -89 % for Cd, -48 % for Al, and -43 % for As) except Hg. The beneficial elements B, Mn, and Se showed oscillations but an overall decline (-86 %, -34 %, and -12 %, respectively) whereas the essentials Co and Cu did not exhibit significant trends. The distance to potential sources of contamination influenced both the spatial patterns of concentrations in owl feathers and their temporal trends. The accumulation of As, Cd, Co, Mn and Pb was overall higher in the vicinity of sites recorded as polluted, and a greater temporal decrease of As, B, and Cd concentrations was found in the areas of further distance to polluted sites. The decrease of Pb concentrations was sharper further from the coast during the 1980s than in coastal areas, while the op-posite was observed for Mn. The levels of Hg and Se were higher in coastal areas, and Hg temporal trends differed ac-cording to the distance to the coast. This study highlights the valuable insights provided by long-term survey of wildlife exposure to pollutants and landscape indicators to reveal regional or local patterns and detect unexpected events, data that are crucial for regulation and conservation of ecosystem health.

AB  - The paper presents the results of KNOW-IN (Knowledge-Intensive Freight Transport SMEs. For a new generation of smart, sustainable and inclusive oriented Road Transport Managers) project, which was developed under the EU Programme LLP/LDV in 2012-2013. The project was aimed at creating a new professional figure: the European road transport manager (EU-RTM) who should possess management skills, tools and actions needed to overcome the challenges faced by the sector. KNOW-IN was coordinated by the European Business and Innovation Centre (CEEI) in Albacete, Spain, and the team consisted of participants from Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom.
   Based on the desk and field research on training needs of staff, topics and methods of training, the attitude of road transport companies to staff training on workplace and the qualities that EU-RTM needs to possess, the project consortium developed:
   Information Toolkit, which is an e-handbook, designed for the European road transport manager (EU-RTM) who wants to increase his/her knowledge and skills in the field of road transport and management. It is where managers in road transport can find solutions to many problems they face to in their daily work routine such as: civil, commercial, social and financial law; business and financial management of the enterprise; market access; technical standards and technical aspects of operation and road safety;
   EU-RTM European Qualification Framework (EQF) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). The matrix of knowledge, skills and competences necessary for road transport managers (EU-RTM) is based on the idea to link them with learning outcomes. The EU-RTM EQF is operationally defined by a system of indicators based on learning outcomes, regardless of how or where these are achieved.
   The following 9 summarized sections of study were determined in compliance with the EQF: Administrative, Business Management, Planning and coordination, Dealing with customers, Human Resource, Management, Vehicle maintenance, Communication, Social skills.
   Each section includes a set of learning outcomes as their number depends on its complex nature. Depending on knowledge and skills acquired, the quality of the EU-RTM is to be assessed.
   The tools developed within KNOW-IN project can be applied across the EU road transport sector. They are available for employers to assess the knowledge and skills of employees set against a standard framework. If any gaps are established, then training should be implemented and it is where project outcomes could be used. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exotic insect pests may strongly disrupt forest ecosystems and trigger major shifts in nutrient cycling, structure, and composition. We examined the relationship between these diverse effects for the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae Annand) in New England forests by studying its impacts on local canopy processes in stands differing in infestation levels and linking these impacts to shifts in canopy nutrient cycling and stand and landscape effects. HWA initiated major changes in canopy biomass and distribution. Whereas uninfested trees exhibit a significant decline in canopy biomass from the center to the periphery and a positive correlation between total needle litter and estimated biomass, infested trees have significantly less total canopy biomass, produce less new foliage, shed relatively more needles, and exhibit no correlation between litter and canopy biomass. Foliar N content of infested trees was 20%-40% higher than reference trees, with the strongest increase in young foliage supporting the highest densities of HWA. Foliar %C was unaffected by HWA or foliar age. Epiphytic microorganisms on hemlock needles exhibited little variation in abundance within canopies, but colony-forming units of bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi were 2-3 orders of magnitude more abundant on medium and heavily infested than uninfested trees. Throughfall chemistry, quantity, and spatial pattern were strongly altered by HWA. Throughfall exhibits a strong gradient beneath uninfested trees, decreasing in volumes from the canopy periphery to the trunk by more than 45%. The amount of throughfall beneath infested trees exhibits no spatial pattern, reaches 80%-90% of the bulk precipitation, and is characterized by significantly higher concentrations of nitrogen compounds, dissolved organic carbon, and cations. Across the southern New England landscape there is a strong south-to-north gradient of decreasing hemlock tree and sapling mortality and understory compositional change that corresponds to the duration of infestation. Regionally, black birch (Betula lenta L.) is profiting most from hemlock decline by significantly increasing in density and cover. These findings suggest that it is necessary to study the connections between fast/small-scale processes such as changes in nutrient cycling in tree canopies and slow/integrative processes like shifts in biogeochemieal cycling and compositional changes at forest stands and landscapes to better understand the effects of an exotic pest species like HWA on forest ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Using two mitochondrial DNA fragments and 13 microsatellite loci, we examined the phylogeographic structure and taxonomy of two codistributed snake species (Natrix natrix, N. tessellata) in their eastern distribution area, with a focus on Turkey. We found evidence for frequent interspecific hybridization, previously thought to be extremely rare, and for backcrosses. This underscores that closely related sympatric species should be studied together because otherwise the signal of hybridization will be missed. Furthermore, the phylogeographic patterns of the two species show many parallels, suggestive of a shared biogeographic history. In general, the phylogeographies follow the paradigm of southern richness to northern purity, but the dice snake has some additional lineages in the south and east in regions where grass snakes do not occur. For both species, the Balkan Peninsula and the Caucasus region served as glacial refugia, with several mitochondrial lineages occurring in close proximity. Our results show that the mitochondrial divergences in both species match nuclear genomic differentiation. Yet, in the former glacial refugia of grass snakes there are fewer nuclear clusters than mitochondrial lineages, suggesting that Holocene range expansions transformed the glacial hotspots in melting pots where only the mitochondrial lineages persisted, bearing witness of former diversity. On the other hand, the deep mitochondrial divergences in N. tessellata across its entire range indicate that more than one species could be involved, even though lacking micro satellite data outside of Turkey prevent firm conclusions. On the contrary, our microsatellite and mitochondrial data corroborate that N. megalocephala is invalid and not differentiated from sympatric populations of N. natrix. For Cypriot grass snakes, our analyses yielded conflicting results. A critical assessment of the available evidence suggests that N. natrix is a genetically impoverished recent invader on Cyprus and taxonomically not distinct from a subspecies also occurring in western Anatolia and the southern Balkans. Based on combined mitochondrial and nuclear genomic evidence we propose that for grass snakes the following subspecies should be recognized in our study region: (1) Natrix natrix vulgaris Laurenti, 1768, southeastern Central Europe and northern Balkans; (2) Natrix natrix moreoticus (Bedriaga, 1882), southern Balkans, western Anatolia, and Cyprus; and (3) Natrix natrix scutata (Pallas, 1771), eastern Anatolia, Caucasus region, Iran, northeastern distribution range (from eastern Poland and Finland to Kazakhstan and the Lake Baikal region). Thus, Natrix natrix cypriaca (Hecht, 1930) becomes a junior synonym ofN. n. moreoticus and Natrix natrix persa (Pallas, 1814) becomes a junior synonym ofN. n. scutata. Due to insufficient material, we could not resolve the status of Natrix natrix syriaca (Hecht, 1930) from the Gulf of Iskenderun, southeastern Turkey.

AB  - Background: The adoption of digital health care within health systems is determined by various factors, including pricing and reimbursement. The reimbursement landscape for digital health in Europe remains underresearched. Although various emergency reimbursement decisions were made during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable health care delivery through videoconferencing and asynchronous care (eg, digital apps), research so far has primarily focused on the policy innovations that facilitated this outside of Europe.Objective: This study examines the digital health reimbursement strategies in 8 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) and Israel.Methods: We mapped available digital health reimbursement strategies using a scoping review and policy mapping framework. We reviewed the literature on the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases. Supplementary records were identified through Google Scholar and country experts.Results: Our search strategy yielded a total of 1559 records, of which 40 (2.57%) were ultimately included in this study. As of August 2023, digital health solutions are reimbursable to some extent in all studied countries except Poland, although the mechanism of reimbursement differs significantly across countries. At the time of writing, the pricing of digital health solutions was mostly determined through discussions between national or regional committees and the manufacturers of digital health solutions in the absence of value-based assessment mechanisms. Financing digital health solutions outside traditional reimbursement schemes was possible in all studied countries except Poland and typically occurs via health innovation or digital health-specific funding schemes. European countries have value-based pricing frameworks that range from nonexistent to embryonic.Conclusions: Studied countries show divergent approaches to the reimbursement of digital health solutions. These differences may complicate the ability of patients to seek cross-country health care in another country, even if a digital health app is available in both countries. Furthermore, the fragmented environment will present challenges for developers of such solutions, as they look to expand their impact across countries and health systems. An increased emphasis on developing a clear conceptualization of digital health, as well as value-based pricing and reimbursement mechanisms, is needed for the sustainable integration of digital health. This study can therein serve as a basis for further, more detailed research as the field of digital health reimbursement evolves.

AB  - The conventional decision-making for bridges is mostly focusing on technical, economical, and safety perspectives. Nowadays, the society devotes an ever-increased effort to the construction sector regarding their environmental performance. However, considering the complexity of the environmental problems and the diverse character of bridges, the related research for bridge as a whole system is very rare. Most existing studies were only conducted for a single indicator, part of the structure components, or a specific life stage.
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized method for quantifying the environmental impact of a product, asset, or service throughout its whole life cycle. However, in the construction sector, LCA is usually applied in the procurement of buildings, but not bridges as yet. This paper presents a comprehensive LCA framework for road bridges, complied with LCA ReCiPe (H) methodology. The framework enables identification of the key structural components and life cycle stages of bridges, followed by aggregation of the environmental impacts into monetary values. The utility of the framework is illustrated by a practical case study comparing five designs for the Karlsnas Bridge in Sweden, which is currently under construction.
   This paper comprehensively analyzed 20 types of environmental indicators among five proposed bridge designs, which remedies the absence of full spectrum of environmental indicators in the current state of the art. The results show that the monetary weighting system and uncertainties in key variables such as the steel recycling rate and cement content may highly affect the LCA outcome. The materials, structural elements, and overall designs also have varying influences in different impact categories. The result can be largely affected by the system boundaries, surrounding environment, input uncertainties, considered impact indicators, and the weighting systems applied; thus, no general conclusions can be drawn without specifying such issues.
   Robustly evaluating and ranking the environmental impact of various bridge designs is far from straightforward. This paper is an important attempt to evaluate various designs from full dimensions. The results show that the indicators and weighting systems must be clearly specified to be applicable in a transparent procurement. This paper provides vital knowledge guiding the decision maker to select the most LCA-feasible proposal and mitigate the environmental burden in the early stage.

AB  - Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are involved in 4.5% of police-reported road crashes in Europe and 14.2% of fatal road crashes. Active and passive safety systems can help to prevent crashes or mitigate the consequences but need detailed scenarios based on analysis of region-specific data to be designed effectively; however, a sufficiently detailed overview focusing on long-haul trucks is not available for Europe. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of crashes in the European Union that involve HGVs weighing 16 tons or more (16 t+). The identification of the most critical scenarios and their characteristics is based on a three-level analysis, as follows. Crash statistics based on data from the Community Database on Accidents on the Roads in Europe (CARE) provide a general overview of crashes involving HGVs. These results are complemented by a more detailed characterization of crashes involving 16 t+ trucks based on national road crash data from Italy, Spain, and Sweden. This analysis is further refined by a detailed study of crashes involving 16 t+ trucks in the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS), including a crash causation analysis. The results show that most European HGV crashes occur in clear weather, during daylight, on dry roads, outside city limits, and on nonhighway roads. Three main scenarios for 16 t+ trucks are characterized in-depth: rear-end crashes in which the truck is the striking partner, conflicts during right turn maneuvers of the truck with a cyclist riding alongside, and pedestrians crossing the road in front of the truck. Among truck-related crash causes, information admission failures (e.g., distraction) were the main crash causation factor in 72% of cases in the rear-end striking scenario while information access problems (e.g., blind spots) were present for 72% of cases in the cyclist scenario and 75% of cases in the pedestrian scenario. The three levels of data analysis used in this paper give a deeper understanding of European HGV crashes, in terms of the most common crash characteristics on EU level and very detailed descriptions of both kinematic parameters and crash causation factors for the above scenarios. The results thereby provide both a global overview and sufficient depth of analysis of the most relevant cases and aid safety system development.

TI  - How to Propagate a Crusade Visually? The Danish Crusade in Estonia in the Late 12th Century and Early 13th Century in the Light of Sacral Architecture
T2  - KUNSTITEADUSLIKKE UURIMUSI
LA  - Estonian
AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse the construction of the round churches in Denmark in the context of the crusades against the Estonians. In the existing historiography of the Baltic Crusades, visual material has mainly played an illustrative role, whereas in the current article it is the chief source. The construction of the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Denmark and in the surrounding regions is primarily reflected in the political rhetoric of two Valdemars: the Great and the Conqueror. During the reign of Valdemar I (1157-1182), the main message of the round churches was to support the power of the new Christian elite, showing them as God's elect, who had the mandate to rule. During the age of Valdemar II (1202-1241), the message seemed to acquire a more militaristic meaning, calling on people to fight for the faith.
   Current research has produced reliable data on 34 round churches in Scandinavia, 19 of which were located in medieval Denmark, 13 in Sweden and two in Norway. According to the earlier view, round churches had a defensive function, but in recent decades they are regarded as multifunctional: a symbolic Holy Sepulchre could fulfil the roles of both defence and storage. Many churches had several floors. In addition, the self-representation of the builders of round churches, such as the king, the bishop and the aristocracy, as well as the context of the Baltic Crusades have been emphasised. The existing research, however, largely ignores the local context, which explains why the Scandinavians, still strongly attached to the Viking society, decided to build round churches, the shape of which is associated with the Holy Sepulchre, and why the churches were built in certain locations. A significant role in the research therefore belongs to the natural environment and cultural landscape.
   The introduction of the new architectural form is closely related to the Piast Dynasty in Poland in the 1120s. To fight the heathen Vends, a need for a Danish-Polish political alliance emerged, which led to the marriage of King Niels's son Magnus and Richiza, the daughter of Prince Boleslaw III. Richiza was the mother of Sofia, the wife of Valdemar I. The Polish rulers built round churches at their residences, but the iconography of the bronze doors of the Gniezno Cathedral, completed in 1170-1180, indicates the possibility that their construction was strongly connected with Christianisation. The doors depict the martyrdom of St Adalbert, who died on a mission to the Prussians in 997 and whose relics King Boleslaw I brought back to Gniezno, which in 1000 became the political centre of the archbishopric and also of the Piasts. The praying Adalbert in front of the round church is depicted next to a scene where his headless body is lying on a frame with the tree of life of the Garden of Eden in the background. Looking at the two pictures certainly brings the message home: he who dies in the name of Christ has his eternal life guaranteed; you die with Him and are resurrected with Him. The round church directly refers to the Holy Sepulchre, and the martyr's death of St Adalbert to the topicality of Christianisation when the doors were made. Poland was then ruled by Richiza's brother, Prince Mieszko III.
   The first round churches in Roskilde and Schleswig were associated with two rivals: Magnus and Knud Lavard, the father of Valdemar I. Both fought the Vends and were married to Slavic princesses. In the 1120s, round churches were probably prestigious buildings at a ruler's residence, demonstrating the owner as an ardent Christian. The first wave of round churches with propagandist tendencies occurred during the reign of Valdemar I. The most intensive period of building was 1171-1174, beginning with Archbishop Eskil's Jerusalem visit and coming to an end with his voluntary exile in France. This was the time when the archbishop and King Valdemar operated together and had the same aims: to secure the sacral royal power and strengthen the position of the Church in Danish society. The construction of round churches was connected with a small group of people: Archbishop Eskil, Bishop Absalon, the king and the leading members of the Hvide clan. The latter belonged to the inner circle of Valdemar and his son Knud VI (King of Denmark in 1182-1202). The reconstruction of the Schleswig church can be seen as marking the victory over the Vends. The imitation of the Holy Sepulchre towered over the most important trading centre of the Baltic Sea region as a powerful visual symbol. The old gods had been part of the real world, whereas the Christian almighty and triumphal God existed above the human sphere. God's earthly power was expressed in the Church as an institution and in the king, elected by God. In order to influence the Danes, as well as the visiting merchants, the invisible God had to be symbolically visualised. Building a round church in Himlingoje, however, also meant maintaining continuity with the ancestors, who had been the most international and powerful rulers in the whole history of Denmark. The same pattern was repeated in the construction of churches in Valleberga and Osterlars, the old centres of power and/or cults. These churches addressed the Danes themselves, stressing their elite as elected by God and with a mandate from their ancestors to rule. It is therefore understandable that, besides the king and bishops, round churches were built by the representatives of the Hvide dynasty. Considering the intensity of church construction in the first half of the 1170s, the question inevitably arises as to whether the letter of Pope Alexander III (1159-1181), issued on 11 September 1171 or 1172 and addressed to the kings, princes and faithful of Scandinavian countries, which called upon them to defend and expand Christianity in Estonia and other barbarian pagan areas, was the initiative of the Papal curia or a reaction to locally emerging ideas. I support the idea of the local initiative, i.e. the crusade against the Estonians might have started much earlier, and not in the early 13th century, as it actually happened. Society was being prepared for it. A factor in the changing situation was probably an attempt by Eskil's grandchildren to murder the king, which forced the archbishop to resign his post. The new archbishop, Absalon, lacked Eskil's influence in the international arena, which was necessary to carry out such a huge undertaking.
   The fall of Jerusalem in 1187 provided a new impetus for a Baltic Crusade. From then onwards all round churches also acquired a defensive function and, besides the Holy Sepulchre, the favoured model increasingly became the new spiritual centre in the Nordic countries: the chapel of St Olav in the Nidaros Cathedral. As St Olav was among the few martyrs to die fighting for the faith, he was an excellent role model for the new soldiers of Christ. St Olav's Church (in Danish, Ols kirke) on Bornholm Island may have been the first round church with a military purpose in Denmark and its construction is understandable in the context of the construction of the Hammershus Castle, which dates to Archbishop Absalon's time. It was probably a watchtower for the town garrison, as well as a navigation structure, the rounded form of which announced the presence of the Christian God to all pagans. It was also a manifestation of the presence of the Danes on an island that lay on the route of both pagans and crusaders. At the time of Valdemar II, communication seemed to be the main factor in choosing the location for churches, primarily places near strategic waterways and connections with the departure harbours for possible crusaders (e.g. Horne and Thorsager). Churches of the 1170s had mainly been located on the island of Zealand, whereas the centre was now on Bornholm Island and the area between Jutland and Zealand. The chief harbour in the latter was the Kalundborg Fjord, which in the Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus even in the Viking times bore the name 'bay of troops' (Haervig). The most prominent and influential person of the Hvide dynasty - Esbern Snare - founded a town and St Mary's Church, with five towers, there. Examples for the Kalundborg Church have been sought among wooden churches, Mediterranean cupola churches and European cathedrals (including Tournai), but it might be better instead to consider a simple Nordic synthesis, as the interior design is amazingly similar to the round churches. The chancel with its polygonal apse, on the other hand, resembles the arms of the cross. Only one building was completed during Esbern's time, where the eastern part had a similar design: the octagon of Nidaros Cathedral, which was originally attached to a singlenave chancel. As the research of Hugo Johansen revealed, each interior side of the square nave of Kalundborg's church is 36 feet, which makes the circumference 144 feet. This follows the measurements of the Holy City in The Book of Revelation (21, 16-17) by John the Apostle. Instead of the Jerusalem fallen into the hands of Moslems, Esbern built his own Heavenly Jerusalem. The church towers above the departure harbour of the crusaders, declaring and justifying the leading role of the Danes in the new crusade. The Kingdom of God brought to Earth provided moral support to everyone who set out on that long journey. It can thus be said that visual propaganda played an immense role in preparations for the crusade against the Estonians.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to cover the competitive struggle of Ukrainians for foreign markets in the second half of the seventeenth century. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism and determinism. Both general scientific (system analysis, synthesis, analogy, generalization) and special historical (critical analysis and comparison of sources, comparability, problem-chronological) methods are used. The scientific novelty. For the first time, the question of the legitimacy of the claims of previous historians about the functioning of the all-Russian market at that time is raised and the role of Ukrainians in this process is reconsidered. Conclusions. Separating from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the National Revolution, Ukraine acquired several fundamentally important economic problems. One of them was the possibility of free maritime trade. In particular, in the north the territory of the first covered part of the Baltic coast, and in the south the Ukrainian lands occupied by it had access to the Black Sea. Although decentralized, politically and economically weakened Poland could not fully guarantee trade across the Baltic Sea, where various foreign merchants, especially Germans, were determined to be powerful competitors, Ukrainians used this path. After leaving the Commonwealth, the situation in this matter, of course, became much more complicated. On the Black Sea coast, the power of Turks and Tatars, who were constantly at war with Muscovy, increased. By joining the Russian state, Ukrainian merchants formally joined the only seaside port in the distant and inhospitable Arkhangelsk, through which Muscovy conducted the most part of its foreign trade. However, nobody expected the new competitors with opened arms here. The road through Pskov and Novgorod to Narva, which was under Swedish rule, did not make things any easier. The division of Ukraine into several parts, mainly on the left bank and the right bank, greatly complicated domestic and foreign trade; merchants were defenceless against the authorities of that countries through which they passed. The local armed conflicts caused problems as well. The international situation in the second half of the seventeenth century caused a number of crisis economic and socio-political phenomena in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ukrainian state, which nevertheless opened favourable prospects for Muscovy in the field of trade. At the same time, the trade interests of Ukrainians were not taken into account by the governments of many foreign countries. Competitive struggle in this area prompted the merchants of the Hetmanate to seek and establish new ways and markets for the sale of their products, in particular in Hungary, Moldaviia, Wallachia, the Baltic States and the East.

AB  - Contrasting views exist on the stability of the Earth's shield regions over the last 1 Ga that have major implications for reconstructing erosion patterns on shields and the supply of sediment to intra-cratonic and marginal basins. This paper explores Phanerozoic denudation rates and patterns on the northern part of the Fennoscandian Shield in the Kola Peninsula, Northwest Russia. This shield region was intruded by magmatic rocks of the Kola Alkaline Province (KAP) in the Devonian and Early Carboniferous. The KAP comprises a varied suite of alkali-ultramafic plutonic and hypabyssal intrusions, diatremes and dykes that was emplaced at various depths in the crust and allows assessment of depths and rates of erosion during and since the KAP magmatic episode. Further evidence of long-term denudation is provided by Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic cover rocks found around the margins of the Kola Peninsula and in the White Sea. The burial and exhumation history is compared to available Apatite Fission Track (AFT) data for the Kola Peninsula and adjacent areas. Post-Devonian denudation rates on the shield rocks of the Kola Peninsula have varied in space and time. Around the periphery of the Kola Peninsula, low long-term denudation of shield rocks is indicated by the survival of Riphean cover rocks and Late Devonian lavas, kimberlite crater facies and near-surface emplacement of dykes. In contrast, in the main belts of KAP intrusions, 4-6 km of rock was removed in response to doming between 460 and 360 Ma. Deep denudation is indicated by the emplacement depths of alkaline intrusions and Phoscorite-Carbonatite pipes (PCPs). Erosion on the Kola Peninsula since 360 Ma has been far more limited. Extensive, shallow, late-stage magmatism associated with PCPs, dykes and the large alkaline intrusions in the KAP indicates that erosion depths nowhere exceeded 2 km. Post Devonian denudation has removed <1 km of rock from the margins of the Kola Peninsula and from the backslope of the Saariselka-Karelia scarp in northern Finland. AFT data point to an important phase of erosion in the early Mesozoic but depths of unroofing of 3-5 km based on AFT cooling ages for this later phase are in conflict with the evidence of lesser erosion provided by the late-stage KAP intrusions and also require unrealistic depths of former Devonian to Triassic cover rocks. Mean denudation rates were greatest (up to 40 m/Myr) during the KAP magmatic phase. Post-Devonian rates across the Kola Peninsula and adjacent shield areas were much lower (<3-6 m/Myr) and are compatible with low long-term denudation rates for other cratons. Further resolution of long-term denudation patterns and rates on the Kola Peninsula requires the application of low-temperature thermochronometry, detailed examination of the regional geomorphology and firmer dating of ancient weathering episodes.

AB  - Background The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of "leaving no one behind". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.
   Methods We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97.5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment.
   Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56.7 (IQR 31.9-66.8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86.8, 95% uncertainty interval 84.6-88.9), Iceland (86.0, 84.1-87.6), and Sweden (85.6, 81.8-87.8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10.9, 9.6-11.9), the Central African Republic (11.0, 8.8-13.8), and Somalia (11.3, 9.5-13.1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past.
   Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations. Copyright The Authors.

AB  - Purpose - The authors will give an overview of the railway market, with a focus on Morocco, before seeing the challenges to face, before listing some benefits of rail links in terms of development, ecology, security, space management, etc. The authors will then give an overview of the development of BIM, its benefits, risks and issues. The purpose of this paper is to verify that the BIM can provide the railway with the tools to face some of its challenges and improve its productivity.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is part of our research project on the integration of BIM in railway, which is the result of a partnership between Colas Rail Maroc and the ENSAK of the Ibn Tofail University of Kenitra. The objective of this paper is mainly to confirm that the integration of BIM with the railway, through a theoretical and practical study, can have positive impacts. To do this, our methodology consists in studying briefly the development of the railway, the need to improve the budgets and schedules of the projects, to increase the productivity, before showing the advantages of the BIM in the sector of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). The study of feedback from railway projects (chosen for their date of completion -beyond 2014, their size, their geographical situation in several countries and for the availability of literature in a new field) will confirm the initial hypotheses. Among the projects studied will be a project that has been the subject of an article written by the authors of this paper. In the discussion of the results, the authors will focus on the benefits, risks and limitations of integrating BIMinto the railway. In conclusion, the authors are laying the groundwork for future research in the field.
   Findings -The cases study discussed in this paper and previous research confirms the hypotheses of the literature. The integration of BIM into railway projects can have several advantages: collaboration, time saving, cost optimization, prevention of conflicts between networks, construction before construction, optimization of facility management, improvement of the quality of works, prefabrication. They also allowed us to illustrate the risks (status and appropriation of the BIM model, lack of standardization of versions or software and lack of understanding of the basics of schedules and specifications) and limitations (lack of feedback, lack of adaptability and convergence of tools). These experiences have also shown that the use of BIM is not just a technological transition, but a revolution in the project management process, which requires several key success factors (participation of all, commitment, change management and adoption of the collaborative approach). Visualization, collaboration and conflict elimination are the three main chapters where the benefits of BIM can be organized. In fact, there is a lot of intersection between these chapters, but they have been chosen as the main ideas around which all the benefits can be better understood. Visualization primarily addresses the benefits to an individual and improving one's personal understanding as a result of using BIM. The collaboration refers to the cooperative action of several team members, which is encouraged and facilitated by BIM. Conflict elimination mainly concerns project-related benefits, such as conflict reduction, waste, risks, costs and time. For railway infrastructure projects, the main purpose of using BIM is to improve the design integration process, internal project team communication and collision detection to eliminate risk of rehabilitation.
   Research limitations/implications - The application of the BIM process in railway infrastructure requires constant improvement. This concerns the development of libraries and the models available to all users in order to encourage the development of this methodology and, consequently, its use of information throughout the life cycle of an infrastructure work.
   Practical implications -The case study of real projects incorporating BIM confirms the results of the literature review. The benefits of integrating BIM into rail projects are multiple and proven: cost control, decision support, avoids extra work due to design errors, improves detection of interface problems, improves planning of vision, help with prefabrication and facility management, etc. Finally, the BIM process is able to overcome delays in procedures slowing the development of the construction industry in many countries, especially in Morocco, because of the slowness of design (or downright bad design).
   Social implications - The integration of BIM into rail is becoming a global trend. This integration requires government decisions and a maturation of technology and tools. The authorities of some developed countries studied (Sweden, UK, France, Germany) in the railways, at different stages of implementation, are adopting BIM in the process of setting up new railway projects. This political impulse is still behind in southern countries, such as Morocco. The trend and the data collected indicate an adoption between 2020 and 2030 of BIM in all/some AEC projects in developed countries. This will have an impact on other countries that will soon be doing the same, especially in the railway sector to adopt the BIM.
   Originality/value - As part of the realization of this paper, we proceeded to the implementation of an electrical substation as part of the project to build 40 electric traction substations built by Colas Rail on behalf of ONCF.

AB  - Background: The CAMbrella coordination action was funded within the Framework Programme 7. Its aim is to provide a research roadmap for clinical and epidemiological research for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that is appropriate for the health needs of European citizens and acceptable to their national research institutes and healthcare providers in both public and private sectors. One major issue in the European research agenda is the demographic change and its impact on health care. Our vision for 2020 is that there is an evidence base that enables European citizens to make informed decisions about CAM, both positive and negative. This roadmap proposes a strategic research agenda for the field of CAM designed to address future European health care challenges. This roadmap is based on the results of CAMbrella's several work packages, literature reviews and expert discussions including a consensus meeting.
   Methods: We first conducted a systematic literature review on key issues in clinical and epidemiological research in CAM to identify the general concepts, methods and the strengths and weaknesses of current CAM research. These findings were discussed in a workshop (Castellaro, Italy, September 7-9th 2011) with international CAM experts and strategic and methodological recommendations were defined in order to improve the rigor and relevance of CAM research. These recommendations provide the basis for the research roadmap, which was subsequently discussed in a consensus conference (Jarna, Sweden, May 9-11th 2012) with all CAMbrella members and the CAMbrella advisory board. The roadmap was revised after this discussion in CAMbrella Work Package (WP) 7 and finally approved by CAMbrella's scientific steering committee on September 26th 2012.
   Results: Our main findings show that CAM is very heterogenous in terms of definitions and legal regulations between the European countries. In addition, citizens' needs and attitudes towards CAM as well as the use and provision of CAM differ significantly between countries. In terms of research methodology, there was consensus that CAM researchers should make use of all the commonly accepted scientific research methods and employ those with utmost diligence combined in a mixed methods framework.
   Conclusions: We propose 6 core areas of research that should be investigated to achieve a robust knowledge base and to allow stakeholders to make informed decisions. These are:
   Research into the prevalence of CAM in Europe: Reviews show that we do not know enough about the circumstances in which CAM is used by Europeans. To enable a common European strategic approach, a clear picture of current use is of the utmost importance.
   Research into differences regarding citizens' attitudes and needs towards CAM: Citizens are the driver for CAM utilization. Their needs and views on CAM are a key priority, and their interests must be investigated and addressed in future CAM research.
   Research into safety of CAM: Safety is a key issue for European citizens. CAM is considered safe, but reliable data is scarce although urgently needed in order to assess the risk and cost-benefit ratio of CAM.
   Research into the comparative effectiveness of CAM: Everybody needs to know in what situation CAM is a reasonable choice. Therefore, we recommend a clear emphasis on concurrent evaluation of the overall effectiveness of CAM as an additional or alternative treatment strategy in real-world settings.
   Research into effects of context and meaning: The impact of effects of context and meaning on the outcome of CAM treatments must be investigated; it is likely that they are significant.
   Research into different models of CAM health care integration: There are different models of CAM being integrated into conventional medicine throughout Europe, each with their respective strengths and limitations. These models should be described and concurrently evaluated; innovative models of CAM provision in health care systems should be one focus for CAM research.
   We also propose a methodological framework for CAM research. We consider that a framework of mixed methodological approaches is likely to yield the most useful information. In this model, all available research strategies including comparative effectiveness research utilising quantitative and qualitative methods should be considered to enable us to secure the greatest density of knowledge possible. Stakeholders, such as citizens, patients and providers, should be involved in every stage of developing the specific and relevant research questions, study design and the assurance of real-world relevance for the research. Furthermore, structural and sufficient financial support for research into CAM is needed to strengthen CAM research capacity if we wish to understand why it remains so popular within the EU. In order to consider employing CAM as part of the solution to the health care, health creation and self-care challenges we face by 2020, it is vital to obtain a robust picture of CAM use and reliable information about its cost, safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. We need to consider the availability, accessibility and affordability of CAM. We need to engage in research excellence and utilise comparative effectiveness approaches and mixed methods to obtain this data. Our recommendations are both strategic and methodological. They are presented for the consideration of researchers and funders while being designed to answer the important and implicit questions posed by EU citizens currently using CAM in apparently increasing numbers. We propose that the EU actively supports an EU-wide strategic approach that facilitates the development of CAM research. This could be achieved in the first instance through funding a European CAM coordinating research office dedicated to foster systematic communication between EU governments, public, charitable and industry funders as well as researchers, citizens and other stakeholders. The aim of this office would be to coordinate research strategy developments and research funding opportunities, as well as to document and disseminate international research activities in this field. With the aim to develop sustainability as second step, a European Centre for CAM should be established that takes over the monitoring and further development of a coordinated research strategy for CAM, as well as it should have funds that can be awarded to foster high quality and robust independent research with a focus on citizens health needs and pan-European collaboration. We wish to establish a solid funding for CAM research to adequately inform health care and health creation decision-making throughout the EU. This centre would ensure that our vision of a common, strategic and scientifically rigorous approach to CAM research becomes our legacy and Europe's reality. We are confident that our recommendations will serve these essential goals for EU citizens.

AB  - Regarding the effects of W-B radiation on aquatic ecosystems, recent scientific and public interest has focused on marine primary producers and on the aquatic web, which has resulted in a multitude of studies indicating mostly detrimental effects of UV-B radiation on aquatic organisms. The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column.
   Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, W-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27 degrees N, 17 degrees W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring.
   Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic Link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to W-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and W-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms.
   On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related W-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web.
   Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar W-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated.
   UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UVB-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. Amphibian populations are in serious decline in many areas of the world, and scientists are seeking explanations for this phenomenon. Most amphibian population declines are probably due to habitat destruction or habitat alteration. Some declines are probably the result of natural population fluctuations. Other explanations for the population declines and reductions in range include disease, pollution, atmospheric changes and introduced competitors and predators. W-B radiation is one agent that may act in conjunction with other stresses to affect amphibian populations adversely.
   The succession of algal communities is controlled by a complex array of external conditions, stress factors and interspecies influences. Freshwater ecosystems have a high turnover and the success of an individual species is difficult to predict, but the development of general patterns of community structure follows defined routes. There is a strong predictive relationship between DOC concentration and the depth to which UV radiation penetrates in lakes. Since DOC varies widely, freshwater systems display a wide range of sensitivity to UV penetration. In these systems, increased solar UV-B radiation is an additional stress factor that may change species composition and biomass productivity.
   The Arctic aquatic ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and is a source of fish and crustaceans for human consumption. Both endemic and migratory species breed and reproduce in this ocean in spring and early summer, at a time when recorded increases in W-B radiation are maximal. Productivity in the Arctic ocean has been reported to be higher and more heterogeneous than in the Antarctic ocean. In the Bering Sea, the sea-edge communities contribute about 40-50% of the total productivity. Because of the shallow water and the prominent stratification of the water layer, the phytoplankton are more exposed and affected by solar W-B radiation. In addition, many economically important fish (e.g., herring, pollock, cod and salmon) spawn in shallow waters where they are exposed to increased solar UV-B radiation. Many of the eggs and early larval stages are found at or near the surface. Consequently, reduced productivity of fish and other marine crops is possible but has not been demonstrated.
   There is increased consensus, covering a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, that environmental W-B, independent of ozone-related increases, is an important ecological stress that influences the growth, survival and distribution of phytoplankton. Polar ecosystems, where ozone-related UV-B increases are the greatest and which are globally significant ecosystems, are of particular concern. However, these ecosystems are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability, which makes it difficult to separate out UV-B-specific effects on single species or whole phytoplankton communities. There is clear evidence for short-term effects. In one study a 4-23% photoinhibition of photosystem II activity was measured under the ozone hole. However, extrapolation of short-term effects to long-term ecological consequences requires various complex effects to be accounted for and quantitative evaluation remains uncertain. (C) 1998 UNEP.
