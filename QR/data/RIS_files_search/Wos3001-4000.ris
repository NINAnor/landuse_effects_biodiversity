AB  - This paper presents a first empirical assessment of carnivore conservation under a performance payment scheme. In Sweden, reindeer herder villages are paid based on the number of lynx (lynx lynx) and wolverine (gulo gulo) offspring certified on their pastures. The villages decide on the internal payment distribution. It is generally assumed that benefit distribution rules are exogenous. We investigate them as an endogenous decision. The data reveals that villages' group size has a direct negative effect on conservation outcomes and an indirect positive effect which impacts conservation outcomes through the benefit distribution rule. This result revises the collective action hypothesis on purely negative effects of group size.

AB  - Like other animal production systems, aquaculture has developed into a highly globalized trade-dependent industry. A major part of aquaculture technology requires fishmeal to produce the feed for farmed species. By tracing and mapping patterns of trade flows globally for fishmeal we show the aquaculture industry's increasing use of marine ecosystems worldwide. We provide an in-depth analysis of the growth decades (1980-2000) of salmon farming in Norway and shrimp farming in Thailand. Both countries, initially net exporters of fishmeal, increased the number of import source nations of fishmeal, peaking in the mid-1990s. Thailand started locally and expanded into sources from all over the globe, including stocks from the North Sea through imports from Denmark, while Norway predominantly relied on northern region source nations to feed farmed salmon. In 2000, both have two geographically alternate sources of fishmeal supply: the combination of Chile and Peru in South America, and a regional complement. We find that fishmeal trade for aquaculture is not an issue of using ecosystems of the South for production in the North, but of trade between nations with industrialized fisheries linked to productive marine ecosystems. We discuss the expansion of marine ecosystem appropriation for the global aquaculture industry and observed shifts in the trade of fishmeal between marine areas over time. Globalization, through information technology and transport systems, has made it possible to rapidly switch between marine areas for fishmeal supply in economically connected food producing systems. But the stretching of the production chain from local to global and the ability to switch between marine areas worldwide seem to undermine the industry's incentives to respond to changes in the capacity of ecosystems to supply fish. For example, trade information does not reveal the species of fish that the fishmeal is made of much less its origins and there is lack of feedback between economic performance and impacts on marine ecosystem services. Responding to environmental feedback is essential to avoid the trap of mining the marine resources on which the aquaculture industry depends. There are grounds to suggest the need for some global rules and institutions that create incentives for seafood markets to account for ecosystem support and capacity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Management of boreal forests with clear-cutting has a marked effect on forest biodiversity. One directly and severely affected group of species is ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), because of their dependence on living host trees. Key questions in nature conservation and potentially for fungal ecosystem services are whether EMF communities as regenerated stands age will develop into a similar composition as in natural stands, and whether forest regeneration method matters. We addressed these questions by analyzing EMF communities in (1) 157-174 year-old natural and about 50-year-old Scots pine forest stands regenerated by (2) clear-cutting and planting, or (3) shelterwood regeneration with naturally established seedlings. We identified 98 EMF species hypotheses (SHs) using IonTorrent sequencing of soil cores from nine forest stands. We compared these results with a sporocarp survey and an RFLP-analysis of ectomycorrhizal roots performed 18 years earlier.
   When testing individual SHs (in the sequencing data 2013) 13 of the 20 most frequent EMF SHs in natural forest stands were present in similar frequencies in 50-year-old managed stands whereas 7 SHs were observed at different frequencies. The overall EMF community composition differed between natural and 50-year-old managed stands both when assessing sporocarp data from 1995 to 1998 and sequencing data from 2013. One individually tested SH was found to differ between 50-year-old shelterwood and clear-cut stands and no difference in EMF overall community composition was found between the two regeneration methods. Species richness was similar in all stands. The RFLP-analysis largely identified the same common species as the current study.
   Our result suggests that timber harvest has a minor effect on frequent EMF in a 30-50 year perspective. However, both the current study of soil mycelia and the sporocarp survey imply the overall composition of EMF communities to be affected. A contributing factor is the higher presence of Norway spruce in the natural stands. Moreover, the majority of species were not sufficiently frequent to be statistically tested. The importance of surviving mycelia, spore bank and new spore deposition is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry's strong connection to the land, together with the ongoing climate-change debate, has generated growing interest in its socio-ecological resilience and vulnerability. The ability of indigenous societies and their activities to respond to change is widely recognized to be dependent on several factors, such as socioeconomic forces and aspects of governance, all of which have long historical backgrounds. However, although historians constantly address questions about human societies, there have been very few historical studies on their resilience, vulnerability and adaptation strategies. Here, using historical sources, we analyze the vulnerability of reindeer husbandry (and the Sami societies that depended on it) in Sweden during the 19th century. We demonstrate that although reindeer management was a much more diverse enterprise at that time than it is now, the major adaptation strategy and constraining forces were similar to those of today. The foremost adaptation strategy was, and still is, the flexible use of pasture area, and the clearest constraints during the 19th century were the loss of authority over the land and the imposed regulation of reindeer management-both of which were strongly connected to the process of colonization.
   Terminology: Throughout this paper we use the terms reindeer management and reindeer pastoralism interchangeably. Sami reindeer pastoralism has been described as a complex system with two different aspects of management: herding and husbandry. Husbandry has been defined as the accumulations of profit whereas herding has been defined as the control of the animals in the terrain (Paine, 1970, p. 53). In a Swedish context husbandry questions concerning slaughter and castration of reindeer were discussed within the household and herding matters were resolved jointly within the traditional working community Siida. The Siida consisted of households working together on traditional pasturelands and these constellations were grouped together into administrative reindeer pasture districts (Sami villages) (Ingold, 1978; Fellman, 1910; Beach, 1981).

AB  - This paper presents the development of quantitative, spatially explicit and alternative scenarios of future agricultural land use in Europe (the 15 European Union member states, Norway and Switzerland). The scenarios were constructed to support analyses of the vulnerability of ecosystem services, but the approach also provides an exploration of how agricultural land use might respond to a range of future environmental change drivers, including climate and socio-economic change. The baseline year was 2000 and the scenarios were constructed for 3 years (2020, 2050 and 2080) at a spatial resolution of 10 min latitude and longitude. Time slices were defined for the climate scenarios as the 10 years before 2020, 2050 and 2080. The scenarios were based on an interpretation of the four storylines of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using a simple supply/demand model of agricultural area quantities at the European scale and the disaggregation of these quantities using scenario-specific, spatial allocation rules. The scenarios demonstrate the importance of assumptions about technological development for future agricultural land use in Europe. If technology continues to progress at current rates then the area of agricultural land would need to decline substantially. Such declines will not occur if there is a correspondingly large increase in the demand for agricultural goods, or if political decisions are taken either to reduce crop productivity through policies that encourage extensification or to accept widespread overproduction. For the set of parameters assumed here, cropland and grassland areas (for the production of food and fibre) decline by as much as 50% of current areas for some scenarios. Such declines in production areas would result in large parts of Europe becoming surplus to the requirement of food and fibre production. Although it is difficult to anticipate how this land would be used in the future, it seems that continued urban expansion, recreational areas (such as for horse riding) and forest land use would all be likely to take up at least some of the surplus. Furthermore, whilst the substitution of food production by energy production was considered in these scenarios, surplus land would provide further opportunities for the cultivation of bioenergy crops.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), also termed as multi-criteria assessment (MCA), is a powerful policy appraisal tool but as Stirling (2006) has suggested, it can be used both for opening up and closing down policy discourses. Our analysis of MCA in addressing a conflict between state forestry and indigenous Sami reindeer herding in Upper Lapland, Finland, illustrates MCA's potential in promoting open discussion about policy alternatives and their consequences, and also its limitations in highly controversial policy processes.
   The key features of the MCA process that served to open up policy discourse were the plural and conditional conclusions, which illustrated the diversity of viewpoints bearing on the Upper Lapland resource management conflict. The main risk of MCA to close down policy processes is to hide the scoring process and let the participants to focus only on the weighing stage. In the article, we present a novel approach to "interrogate uncertainties" and open up the information base. The Upper Lapland case study also illustrates the limits of MCA in the face of fundamental questions of ethical principle. MCA was helpful in addressing the problem situation that was formulated in terms of two competing livelihoods, forestry and reindeer herding, but unhelpful when the problem situation was formulated in terms of indigenous Sami people struggle for land rights.

AB  - The official governance of the reindeer pastoralist system in the north of Norway relies overwhelmingly on one central argument: that in order to maintain a sustainable system, maximum numbers and densities of reindeer, as well as certain herd structures, should be upheld. If these indicators are ignored, the argument goes, the consequences are resource degradation and economic collapse. Even though this argument has been challenged by both researchers and reindeer herders across Fennoscandia, it continues to dominate management policies and practice. Here we set out to investigate the validity of the premise that there is a strong relationship between density and carcass weights over the whole of Finnmark, based on official data. We find that although the relationship is present, its explanatory power is not very strong in a variety of circumstances and propose that it therefore cannot be used to frame important governance policies for the whole system. We also critically reflect on the model's goal of high productivity per capita of reindeer (high carcass weight). We suggest that productivity per area unit can be at least as relevant as carcass weights and perhaps a better indicator for pastoralist systems in general. For the Finnmark pastoralist system, we argue, a measure of productivity in kilogrammes per square kilometer reveals a different picture: rather than being a failed system marred by suffering animals and low economic returns, reindeer herding in Western Finnmark becomes the most productive in Norway. This shift of focus is likely relevant for other pastoralist systems where governance is premised on similar arguments.

AB  - A recent article in Pastoralism (Stien et al., Pastoralism 11:1-7, 2021) criticized our earlier analysis of the management models used for reindeer pastoralism in Western Finnmark, Norway (Marin et al., Pastoralism 10:1-8, 2020). According to our critics, we misunderstood the origin of the current emphasis on maximum reindeer numbers and densities. Second, we came to the (wrong) conclusion "that densities are of minor importance for reindeer productivity" because we had made several mistakes in our statistical analyses.This article discusses the main points we were criticized for, shows where disagreements persist and suggests some possible ways forward. We hope this discussion will help make clearer what we did in our original article and why we still think a focus on density (and implicitly maximum reindeer numbers) is not a good management tool in Western Finnmark. We also show that the influential report from 2001 by Ims and Kosmo was based on controversial interpretations of "quality objectives" for carcass weights as the starting point for their calculations of maximum number of reindeer for each district. In addition, we document some of the reactions from herders to that report and how the choice of districts included in such analyses can lead to different results and conclusions. We re-did our calculations of how much of the variation in the carcass weights of 1.5-year-old bucks (varit) can be explained by the number of reindeer in the spring herd (expressed as density of reindeer over the area of the summer district). The combined results of the two research teams show that between 35 and 46% of the variation can be explained by the density of reindeer, depending on the method, which is much less than the 70% that was found in 2001. Specifically, we show that the difference between our results (35% explained by density) and those of our critics (46% explained by density) is mainly because our critics have included 3 districts from Eastern Finnmark (Karasjok districts) in their analysis, but that there is no obvious reason to include these. We emphasize that research of this kind should think carefully about and report precisely the geographical scale at which the analysis is made and the reasons for this choice. Finally, we show that there is a need to report the views of reindeer herders in a more nuanced and precise way, to reflect variations among them, and to better explain their views.Our conclusion is still that the density of reindeer herds should not be used as the most important indicator for how well the herds are doing or for how sustainable reindeer pastoralism is in Western Finnmark. This is because other complex environmental and social factors also play a very important role, which needs to be better understood. Because of this, we argue for reindeer herders' knowledge to be given more practical influence in the management plans.(Fuomas ahte lea samegielat & ccaron;oahkkaigeassu artihkkala loahpas-geah & ccaron;a Additional file 1 /The article includes a summary in North Sami language-see Additional file 1).

AB  - Global Forest Watch (GFW) provides a global map of annual forest cover loss (FCL) produced from Landsat imagery, offering a potentially powerful tool for monitoring changes in forest cover. In managed forests, FCL primarily provides information on commercial harvesting. A semi-autonomous method for providing data on the location and attributes of harvested sites at a landscape level was developed which could significantly improve the basis for catchment management, including risk mitigation. FCL in combination with aerial images was used for detecting and characterising harvested sites in a 1607 km(2) mountainous boreal forest catchment in south-central Norway. Firstly, the forest cover loss map was enhanced (FCLE) by removing small isolated forest cover loss patches that had a high probability of representing commission errors. The FCLE map was then used to locate and assess sites representing annual harvesting activity over a 17-year period. Despite an overall accuracy of >98%, a kappa of 0.66 suggested only a moderate quality for detecting harvested sites. While errors of commission were negligible, errors of omission were more considerable and at least partially attributed to the presence of residual seed trees on the site after harvesting. The systematic analysis of harvested sites against aerial images showed a detection rate of 94%, but the area of the individual harvested site was underestimated by 29% on average. None of the site attributes tested, including slope, area, altitude, or site shape index, had any effect on the accuracy of the area estimate. The annual harvest estimate was 0.6% (standard error 12%) of the productive forest area. On average, 96% of the harvest was carried out on flat to moderately steep terrain (<40% slope), 3% on steep terrain (40% to 60% slope), and 1% on very steep terrain (>60% slope). The mean area of FCLE within each slope category was 1.7 ha, 0.9 ha, and 0.5 ha, respectively. The mean FCLE area increased from 1.0 ha to 3.2 ha on flat to moderate terrain over the studied period, while the frequency of harvesting increased from 249 to 495 sites per year. On the steep terrain, 35% of the harvesting was done with cable yarding, and 62% with harvester-forwarder systems. On the very steep terrain (>60% slope), 88% of the area was harvested using cable yarding technology while harvesters and forwarders were used on 12% of the area. Overall, FCL proved to be a useful dataset for the purpose of assessing harvesting activity under the given conditions.

AB  - The effects of a large holiday resort on the distribution and range use of semi-domesticated reindeer were studied in the three most important habitat types in Saariselka, eastern Finnish Lapland. In two of these habitats the relative reindeer densities increased in winter, when outdoor activities declined reaching density equal to the average for the herding association at a distance of about 10 km from the holiday resort. In summer, male reindeer adapted better than females to the proximity of the holiday resort. The feeding site preferences of the reindeer during winter followed, in general, the normal pattern in areas with little human interference. Although the economic value of the range loss appeared small compared to the gain from outdoor enterprises, better planning is needed to avoid the harmful effects of recreation on reindeer management.

AB  - The increase in the Finnish semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) stock and the high level of meat production during the 198Os and the beginning of the 1990s were mainly due to reindeer-management practices. However, the continuing deterioration of winter-range quality has now forced reindeer managers to invest increasingly in supplementary feeding. At the same rime, carrying-capacity models for semidomesticated-reindeer ranges have proved difficult to develop. This study deals with reproduction and productivity of the reindeer stock in northern Finland during the period 1987-1995. The results reveal that reproduction and productivity of reindeer in the study area are largely regulated by density-dependent factors related to the quantity and quality of winter ranges. Reindeer densities on total rangeland had the strongest effect on the slaughter body masses of reindeer, which indicates the special importance of summer and autumn pastures for growth and autumn condition of reindeer. Through intensive calf slaughtering, the natural mortality rate was minimised and reproduction rates and reindeer meat production were increased, although winter ranges were heavy grazed. Developing semidomesticated-reindeer husbandry to be more economical in the future by keeping sustainable meat production at a sufficiently high level while maintaining reindeer rangeland in adequate condition and supplementary feeding quite marginal in Finland involves consideration of both ecological and management factors. One way of looking at the economic carrying capacity of Finnish semidomesticated-reindeer ranges is to develop a model based on dependence among the factors presented in this study. Sustainable net incomes from reindeer husbandry could then be optimised by studying and modelling the economy of reindeer management itself with respect to stock density.

AB  - Protection forests play a key role in protecting settlements, people, and infrastructures from gravitational hazards such as rockfalls and avalanches in mountain areas. Rapid climate change is challenging the role of protection forests by altering their dynamics, structure, and composition. Information on local- and regional-scale impacts of climate change on protection forests is critical for planning adaptations in forest management. We used a model of forest dynamics (ForClim) to assess the succession of mountain forests in the Eastern Alps and their protective effects under future climate change scenarios. We investigated eleven representative forest sites along an elevational gradient across multiple locations within an administrative region, covering wide differences in tree species structure, composition, altitude, and exposition. We evaluated protective performance against rockfall and avalanches using numerical indices (i.e., linker functions) quantifying the degree of protection from metrics of simulated forest structure and composition. Our findings reveal that climate warming has a contrasting impact on protective effects in mountain forests of the Eastern Alps. Climate change is likely to not affect negatively all protection forest stands but its impact depends on site and stand conditions. Impacts were highly contingent to the magnitude of climate warming, with increasing criticality under the most severe climate projections. Forests in lower-montane elevations and those located in dry continental valleys showed drastic changes in forest structure and composition due to drought-induced mortality while subalpine forests mostly profited from rising temperatures and a longer vegetation period. Overall, avalanche protection will likely be negatively affected by climate change, while the ability of forests to maintain rockfall protection depends on the severity of expected climate change and their vulnerability due to elevation and topography, with most subalpine forests less prone to loosing protective effects. Proactive measures in management should be taken in the near future to avoid losses of protective effects in the case of severe climate change in the Alps. Given the heterogeneous impact of climate warming, such adaptations can be aided by model-based projections and high local resolution studies to identify forest stand types that might require management priority for maintaining protective effects in the future.

AB  - Large-scale bark beetle outbreaks in spruce dominated mountain forests have increased in recent decades, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. These outbreaks have immediate and major effects on forest structure and ecosystem services. However, it remains unclear how forests recover from bark beetle infestations over the long term, and how different recovery stages fulfil the capacity of forests to protect infrastructures and human lives from natural hazards.The aim of this study was to investigate how a bark beetle infestation (1992-1997) in a spruce dominated forest in the Swiss Alps changed the forest structure and its protective function against snow avalanches. In 2020, i.e. 27 years after the peak of the outbreak, we re-surveyed the composition and height of new trees, as well as the deadwood height and degree of decay in an area that had been surveyed 20 years earlier. With the help of remote sensing data and avalanche simulations, we assessed the protective effect against avalanches before the disturbances (in 1985) and in 1997, 2007, 2014 and 2019 for a frequent (30-year return period) and an extreme (300-year return period) avalanche scenario. Post-disturbance regeneration led to a young forest that was again dominated by spruce 27 years after the outbreak, with median tree heights of 3-4 m and a crown cover of 10-30%.Deadwood covered 20-25% of the forest floor and was mainly in decay stages two and three out of five. Snags had median heights of 1.4 m, leaning logs 0.5 m and lying logs 0.3 m. The protective effect of the forest was high before the bark beetle outbreak and decreased during the first years of infestation (until 1997), mainly in the case of extreme avalanche events. The protective capacity reached an overall minimum in 2007 as a result of many forest openings. It partially recovered by 2014 and further increased by 2019, thanks to forest regeneration. Simulation results and a lack of avalanche releases since the infestation indicate that the protective capacity of post-disturbance forest stands affected by bark beetle may often be underestimated.

AB  - It is important to the conservation and management of threatened or endangered carnivores to recognize interspecific interactions that can influence demography or behavior of the species involved. We studied the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), an efficient predator, and wolverine (Gulo gulo), an opportunistic predator and scavenger, that coexist in the reindeer husbandry area in northern Sweden. Both species are major predators on semidomestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), but wolverines frequently scavenge ungulate carcasses. We examined the composition and use of food resources by wolverines and in particular the relative importance of lynx-killed reindeer in wolverine diet. We also examined the influence of wolverine scavenging on lynx kill rate. We found that 52% of carcasses visited by wolverines were lynx-killed reindeer, but only 11% were wolverine-killed reindeer. Of all wolverine locations at carcasses, 28% were on lynx-killed and 24% on wolverine-killed reindeer. Remaining locations were mainly on reindeer that died from accidents (23%) or were killed by unknown carnivores (9%). Lynx predation rate on reindeer was nine times higher than that of wolverines. Wolverines scavenged 68% of available lynx-killed reindeer, 29% of which were still being used by lynx at wolverine arrival. Still, wolverine scavenging had a limited influence on lynx kill rate. Time to next kill decreased only when the lynx kill was an adult reindeer in forest; however, most lynx-killed reindeer were found on tundra. Wolverines appear to benefit from coexistence with lynx through increased scavenging opportunities. We suspect that lynx presence reduces wolverine predation on reindeer due to increased scavenging opportunities. These results may have important implications for carnivore management in reindeer husbandry areas.

AB  - Sami reindeer pastoralism in Norway is said to be in a state of crisis that has lasted for several decades and is due to excessive numbers of reindeer. A general overstocking of the range is believed to cause widespread pasture degradation, poor economic performance, and increasing land-use conflicts. These are the main assumptions of a dominant narrative shared by key government and non-governmental actors, most scientists, and the media. The resulting policy focuses on reducing reindeer numbers to set carrying capacities in order to promote ecological sustainability and improve economic performance through the means of increasing carcass weights. The article presents a critical review of the ecological evidence behind the dominant narrative. The authors conclude that the narrative and the associated policy lead to a misreading of the Arctic pastoral landscape that neglects both alternative scientific evidence and interpretations in line with non-equilibrium ecology as well as the indigenous knowledge of the reindeer herders. Hence, such alternative perspectives generally remain invisible to the government institutions that regulate the practice of reindeer management. Further, the authors' study resonates with wider theoretical debates about state governance within political ecology and development studies in general.

AB  - During the harshest winter, preference of forest habitat by reindeer should be dependent on the availability of energy-rich lichens, while in summer and easy snow conditions on the availability of protein-richer food. Reindeer should also avoid linear infrastructure (roads, power lines) if it causes disturbance and energy loss. We tested seasonal home range and habitat selection by semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in a sub-arctic pine forest area, northern Finland by tracking 29 female reindeer with GPS collars from 1999-2002. As expected, reindeer preferred old-growth forest and avoided felled areas and linear infrastructure in the selection and use of their wintering areas. Old-growth forest had high preference especially in late winter. During summer and early winter, reindeer also used sapling stand areas, young cultivated forests, mires and high-elevation open land. The net energy balance hypothesis including the total energy profits and expenditures could primarily explain habitat selection by reindeer during winter in intensively grazed and logged forest areas. Maintaining a certain amount of old-growth forest and minimizing linear infrastructure in wintering areas considerably improves the suitability of these ranges for reindeer herding.

AB  - In tropical forest, landscape fragmentation and the consequent degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these conditions, lianas (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less influence of the edge effect. For this, lianas colonization is an important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In this context, it becomes important to understand the nature of the competitive relationships between hyper-abundant lianas and ring growth of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of lianas from two tropical species Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) -localized in a semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The results showed that the lianas caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by lianas had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species, an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climatetree relationship indicated that trees with lianas had lower response to rainfall and higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period); in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with lianas had a 2-month delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive colonization of lianas. We believe that these methods are applicable to future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Organic enrichment associated with marine finfish aquaculture is a local stressor of marine coastal ecosystems. To maintain ecosystem services, the implementation of biomonitoring programs focusing on benthic diversity is required. Traditionally, impact-indices are determined by extracting and identifying benthic macroinvertebrates from samples. However, this is a time-consuming and expensive method with low upscaling potential. A more rapid, inexpensive, and robust method to infer the environmental quality of marine environments is eDNA metabarcoding of bacterial communities. To infer the environmental quality of coastal habitats from metabarcoding data, two taxonomy-free approaches have been successfully applied for different geographical regions and monitoring goals, namely quantile regression splines (QRS) and supervised machine learning (SML). However, their comparative performance remains untested for monitoring the impact of organic enrichment introduced by aquaculture on marine coastal environments. We compared the performance of QRS and SML using bacterial metabarcoding data to infer the environmental quality of 230 aquaculture samples collected from seven farms in Norway and seven farms in Scotland along an organic enrichment gradient. As a measure of environmental quality, we used the Infaunal Quality Index (IQI) calculated from benthic macrofauna data (reference index). The QRS analysis plotted the abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) as a function to the IQI from which the ASVs with a defined abundance peak were assigned to eco-groups and a molecular IQI was subsequently calculated. In contrast, the SML approach built a random forest model to directly predict the macrofauna-based IQI. Our results show that both QRS and SML perform well in inferring the environmental quality with 89% and 90% accuracy, respectively. For both geographic regions, there was high correspondence between the reference IQI and both the inferred molecular IQIs (p < 0.001), with the SML model showing a higher coefficient of determination compared to QRS. Among the 20 most important ASVs identified by the SML approach, 15 were congruent with the good quality spline ASV indicators identified via QRS for both Norwegian and Scottish salmon farms. More research on the response of the ASVs to organic enrichment and the co-influence of other environmental parameters is necessary to eventually select the most powerful stressor-specific indicators. Even though both approaches are promising to infer environmental quality based on metabarcoding data, SML showed to be more powerful in handling the natural variability. For the improvement of the SML model, addition of new samples is still required, as background noise introduced by high spatio-temporal variability can be reduced. Overall, we recommend the development of a powerful SML approach that will be onwards applied for monitoring the impact of aquaculture on marine ecosystems based on eDNA metabarcoding data.

AB  - Spatiotemporal reindeer population fluctuations are a result of multiple factors that working in concert affecting the structure and functioning of many Arctic and Sub-Arctic ecosystems. We investigated the population dynamics of Swedish semi-domestic reindeer from 1945 to 2012 at the reindeer herding district-level (Sameby) to identify possible population collapses or declines. We also explored spatial trends and synchrony in population dynamics across latitudinal-longitude gradients for two distinct periods: 1945-1965 and 1995-2012 but found no evidence of large-scale reindeer population declines and no visible synchrony across adjacent populations. Our findings were unexpected as both reindeer populations and the pastoral lifestyle face increased habitat loss, predation, fragmentation and climate change.

AB  - This paper explores how national socialist aesthetics and semiotics are regimented within the Swedish Nazi milieu today. In order to treat fascism as contemporary ideology, the article applies intertextuality and provenance as analytical concepts in the analysis of how Nazism is re-emerging discursively. The analysis contributes unique insights, as the dataset consists of extremist discourse aimed at providing members of the most prominent Swedish Nazi movement with guidance on how to embody and express national socialism in their everyday lives. The analysis reveals that common-sense notions about 'a natural life' and mainstream aesthetics concerning an outdoor lifestyle emerge as central expressions of a 'natural' and 'healthy' embodiment of national socialism. This aesthetic finds its ideological motive in opposition to a 'sick', 'Jewish' and 'parasitical' way of living. Mainstream notions are thus turned into vehicles for political extremism.

AB  - This paper argues that Sami reindeer pastoralism in Sweden is highly stressed during the critical snow cover periods due to large-scale human interventions, especially forestry, and that these have over time significantly worsened the ecological conditions for natural grazing-based responses to changing snow conditions caused by climate change. Informed by a literature review, the paper conceptualises two, overlapping ecological dynamics that shape the availability of lichen as key forage resources within a Sami pastoral landscape perspective: the grazing dynamics of reindeer during snow cover periods as determined by climatic stochasticity, and the more predictable vegetation dynamics of lichen habitat formation, growth and sustenance based on structured forestry practices. This could help articulate an intervention ecology that pursues sustainable ecological conditions for natural grazing-based Sami reindeer pastoralism, along with other goals. As such alternatives are likely to face political resistance, the article discusses the implications of its findings within a science-politics interface.

AB  - Reindeer species (Rangifer tarandus, Linnaeus, 1758) includes wild and semidomesticated ruminants belonging to Capreaolinae subfamily of Cervidae family reared in Eurasia (reindeer subspecies) and North America (caribou subspecies). Herding of reindeer has a great historical, socio-economic and ecological importance, especially to indigenous ethnic minorities. Infectious disease threats may therefore impact not solely the animal population driving it to further extinction and irreversible alterations to the wild environments of northern hemisphere, but also add to cultural changes observed as negative impact of globalization. Introduction of new technologies to control of reindeer migration between dwindling pasture areas and intensification of reindeer husbandry may facilitate the intra- and interspecies transmission of pathogens. The role of the reindeer as a potential BVDV reservoir has been studied, however, the number of publications is rather limited. The observed seroprevalences of the virus varied significantly between different geographical regions with different epidemiological situation. Most frequently limited number of animals studied and the differences in the sensitivities and specificities of the diagnostic test used could have also influenced on the differences between the studies. No pestivirus has been ever detected in free-ranging reindeer, however, a putative pestivirus strain named V60-Krefeld has been isolated from reindeer kept at a German Zoo in the 1990's. The virus was characterized as border disease virus type 2 (BDV-2) closely related to German ovine strains. The cross-neutralization studies of the semi-domesticated reindeer sera from Sweden suggested infection with a strain related to BDV-1 or BDV-2. The available data indicates that reindeer might be infected by a endemic species specific BDV-like strain. However, the interspecies transmission of BVDV from domestic animals should not be excluded, since the susceptibility of reindeer to BVDV-1 has been confirmed under experimental conditions.

AB  - Soil compaction caused by vehicular traffic adversely affects key soil functions and ecosystem services that soils provide. Although compaction is a well-recognized problem, it remains challenging to quantify the economic and ecological costs of compaction. The mechanization in agriculture has resulted in a steady increase in weight of farm vehicles. It is reasonable to assume that this has exacerbated soil compaction, but there is little quantitative knowledge on the development of compaction levels in arable soils. To quantify these trends, we use historical records of harvester and tractor weights to simulate how the weight increase has changed soil stresses and bulk density of arable soil, and to predict impacts on the mechanical resistance for root growth and on soil hydraulic properties. Our simulations show a clear increase in soil stress levels with higher bulk density and mechanical penetration resistance, and a decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity in agreement with available data. We show that increased mechanical resistance has resulted in decreased root elongation rates and consequently prolonged the time required for roots to reach a certain soil depth. The historical changes of compaction levels and associated limitations on root elongation rates coincide with a stagnation in crop yields in the 1990s observed for cereals in many countries. Our calculations illustrate that the historical increase in compaction levels has drastically decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of subsoils. We speculate that this has contributed to the increase in the incidence and severity of flood events during recent decades in Europe. Finally, we take Sweden as an example and estimate annual compaction costs due to agricultural productivity loss and flooding damage of several hundred M(sic) yr(-1) for Sweden. Considering the continuation of upwards trends in the average weight of farm machinery and the projected increase in extreme weather events, the costs of soil compaction are likely to escalate. The study highlights that we have likely exceeded the acceptable loads, and that future agricultural operations must consider the inherent mechanical limit of soil.

AB  - Kin relations have a strong theoretical and empirical basis for explaining cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, there is growing recognition that context-the cooperative environment of an individual-also shapes the willingness of individuals to cooperate. For nomadic pastoralists in Norway, cooperation among both kin and non-kin is an essential predictor for success. The northern parts of the country are characterized by a history of herder-herder competition exacerbating between-herder conflict, lack of trust, and subsequent coordination problems. In contrast, because of a history of herder-farmer competition, southern Norway is characterized by high levels of between-herder coordination and trust. This comparative study investigates the relative importance of "cooperative context" and kinship in structuring cooperative behavior using an experimental gift game. The main findings from this study were that in the South, a high level of cooperation around an individual pushes gifts to be distributed evenly among other herders. Nevertheless, kinship matters, since close kin give and receive larger gifts. In contrast, kinship seems to be the main factor affecting gift distribution in the North. Herders in the North are also concerned with distributing gifts equally, albeit limiting them to close kin: the level of intragroup cooperation drives gifts to be distributed evenly among other closely related herders. The observed regional contrasts in cooperative decisions fit with the different historical levels of conflict and trust in the two regions: whereas herders in the South are affected by both cooperative context and kinship, kinship seems to be the main determinant of cooperation in the North.

AB  - We have analyzed DNA microsatellites and the mitochondrial control region in reindeer from 31 different husbandry areas in Norway, Sweden, and Finland in order to better understand the processes that underlie the genetic variability of the Nordic domestic herds. The distinct differentiation found in the nuclear markers but less so in the mitochondrial marker gives evidence of an origin from a common ancestral population which later evolved into the two main gene pools characterizing the nuclear genomes of domestic reindeer in Finland and most of Sweden and Norway. Analyses of temporal trends in effective population size give evidence of a rapid increase in number of reindeer before the population growth associated with the pastoral transition. This implies that the ancestry of contemporary domestic reindeer lay among a rapidly growing wild population possibly located in the boreal areas of eastern Fennoscandia or European Russia. The evolution of reindeer husbandry in Finland, perhaps with input from European Russia, which later spread to northern Norway could explain the shared genomic pattern observed in these areas today. The structured selection of productive female-centered herds may explain the genetic structure in other parts of Norway and in Sweden. The further substructuring of the Swedish/ Norwegian gene pool appears to follow the traditional language borders with the South Sami language dominating the southern and the Central Sami language in the more northern genetic subclusters. This suggests that traditional knowledge, cultural identities, and herd migrations have contributed to shape the genetic structure seen today. Ecological gradients are more pronounced within as compared to between the genetic clusters, giving further evidence that historical and social-cultural processes are important drivers for the genetic differentiations found in domestic reindeer across the Nordic countries.

AB  - According to the hygiene and biodiversity hypotheses, increased hygiene levels and reduced contact with biodiversity can partially explain the high prevalence of immune-mediated diseases in developed countries. A disturbed commensal microbiota, especially in the gut, has been linked to multiple immune-mediated diseases. Previous studies imply that gut microbiota composition is associated with the everyday living environment and can be modified by increasing direct physical exposure to biodiverse materials. In this pilot study, the effects of rural-second-home tourism were investigated on the gut microbiota for the first time. Rural-second-home tourism, a popular form of outdoor recreation in Northern Europe, North America, and Russia, has the potential to alter the human microbiota by increasing exposure to nature and environmental microbes. The hypotheses were that the use of rural second homes is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and that the microbiota related to health benefits are more diverse or common among the rural-second-home users. Based on 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing of stool samples from 10 urban elderly having access and 15 lacking access to a rural second home, the first hypothesis was supported: the use of rural second homes was found to be associated with lower gut microbiota diversity and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway levels. The second hypothesis was not supported: health-related microbiota were not more diverse or common among the second-home users. The current study encourages further research on the possible health outcomes or causes of the observed microbiological differences. Activities and diet during second-home visits, standard of equipment, surrounding environment, and length of the visits are all postulated to play a role in determining the effects of rural-second-home tourism on the gut microbiota.

AB  - We made a quantitative analysis of the responses of urban and rural residents in Sweden to arguments supporting and opposing conservation of large carnivores. The most important arguments in favour of conservation were: "I want them [the large carnivores] to exist in Sweden, even if I will never see any of them", "Sweden should share the responsibility of conserving the large carnivores" and "We owe it [conservation of large carnivores] to future generations". We found only small differences between rural and urban residents. For arguments opposing conservation, the difference between rural and urban areas was slightly greater. The most important arguments opposing conservation of large carnivores were: "They may have serious negative impact on livestock farming", "They may have serious negative impact on reindeer husbandry" and "May inflict suffering on injured livestock". We conclude that there seems to be less support for direct use values such as hunting, ecotourism or just experiencing large carnivores, this may imply that the minimum viable population size can be used as a long-term management goal for large carnivore populations, possibly with an exception for bears. We also conclude that a separate conservation or management plan is needed for each species, since the conflicts with human interests vary greatly between the different carnivore species.

AB  - The article presents the results of two succeeding Norwegian studies on the environmental impacts of leisure consumption. The first study presents data on the total consumption of leisure products and services by Norwegians, showing that leisure consumption increases more than everyday consumption, the most energy-intensive leisure activities increase the most, leisure activities have become more dependent on transportation and that leisure activities are to an increasing extent based on more material consumption. The second study consists of case studies from four leisure activities in Norway that have experienced the greatest increases in consumption over the last two decades: outdoor recreation clothing, cabins, leisure boating and leisure transportation. The case studies show that the problems connected with reducing the environmental impacts of leisure consumption are numerous and complex, and cannot be solved alone by technological improvements in leisure products and services. We conclude that new policies have to be developed which can on a short-term basis promote changes of leisure consumer habits in a more environmentally friendly direction, and on a long-term basis alter the existing strong links between economic growth and leisure consumption.

AB  - In a previous study by Tucker Cross and Kiiller (2004), a method was developed for describing environmental atmosphere based on Swedish expert evaluations of six multifamily housing areas in southern Sweden. The assessments of these experts were validated by residents using post-occupancy evaluations (POE). The main purpose of that study was to determine if experts could predict environmental qualities that residents desired within their outdoor living environment. One aim of the present study was to compare the Swedish expert findings with the assessments made by foreign professionals using the same checklist in order to discover any significant agreements and differences between these groups. The checklist used in this and the previous studies consisted of items that cover general layout, complexity and coherence, identity and affection, construction materials, greenery, climate, pollution and noise, ecological sustainability, meeting areas, privacy, security and traffic control, and maintenance. One concern regarding the use of checklists by professionals from different regions might be the validity of specific items and the relevance of these items to various cultural aspects. Despite the large differences in cultural backgrounds between the professionals coming from Northern Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe, the environmental assessments showed consistent similarities between the groups. Eighteen of the items significantly differentiated between the residential housing areas. For four items, significant group differences were noted, and for three items there was a significant interaction effect between groups and areas. The instrument has shown its potential as a reliable and valid checklist even when used by a diverse group of foreign professionals.

We present initial findings from a field study of 29 visitors to a Finnish outdoor recreational island who used an exploratory cultural heritage app, augmented with a set of proximity triggered multimodal boxes, to present multimodal and multisensory content (ranging from smell, audio and physical interactions). We outline how this enhanced visitors' experience, as well as practical issues in the use of the boxes, and future development of our work.

AB  - Contemporary efforts to protect biological diversity recognize the importance of sustaining traditional human livelihoods, particularly uses of the land that are compatible with intact landscapes and ecologically complete food webs. However, these efforts often confront conflicting goals. For example, conserving native predators may harm pastoralist economies because predators consume domestic livestock that sustain people. This potential conflict must be reconciled by policy, but such reconciliation requires a firm understanding of the effects of predators on the prey used by people. We used a long-term, large-scale database and Bayesian models to estimate the impacts of lynx (Lynx lynx), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and brown bear (Ursus arctos) on harvest of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) by Sami pastoralists in Sweden. The average annual harvest of reindeer averaged 25% of the population (95% credible interval = 19, 31). Annual harvest declined by 96.6 (31, 155) reindeer for each lynx family group (the surveyed segment of the lynx population) in a management unit and by 94.3 (20, 160) for each wolverine reproduction (the surveyed segment of the wolverine population). We failed to detect effects of predation by brown bear. The mechanism for effects of predation on harvest was reduced population growth rate. The rate of increase of reindeer populations declined with increasing abundance of lynx and wolverine. The density of reindeer, latitude, and weather indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation also influenced reindeer population growth rate. We conclude that there is a biological basis for compensating the Sami reindeer herders for predation on reindeer.

T2  - SCANDINAVIAN HOUSING & PLANNING RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - URBAN
AB  - An investigation of the environmental content in land use planning in the Norwegian municipality of Sandefjord and the Polish municipality of Myslenice shows a surprisingly high degree of similarity. In both cases, the protection of farmland and scarce biotopes as well as sewage management has been emphasised in the plans. Cultural heritage and cultural landscapes have been a strong concern in Myslenice, while Sandefjord has paid more attention to natural areas for outdoor recreation. In both cases there has been little focus on energy conservation, and the concept of sustainable development has hardly been discussed. The content of the plans has been considerably influenced by national environmental policies. The type of political system (capitalism vs, state socialism) has indirectly influenced the amount of construction and hence the pace of conversion of undeveloped land, but does not appear to have had much influence on the environmental content of the plans apart from this. The emphasis laid on various environmental issues in part reflects the actual local challenges, but also cross-national cultural differences and the fact that the environmental agenda has been widened in both municipalities during the period, most pronounced in Sandefjord. Professional ideals, knowledge and methods common among planners across national boundaries seem to have influenced the content of the plans considerably.

AB  - Keymessage Non-stochastic portfolio optimization of forest stands provides a good alternative to stochastic meanvariance optimization when available statistical data is incomplete. The suggested approach has a theoretical background in the areas of robust optimization, continuous multicriteria decision-making, and fuzzy theory. Resulting robust portfolios only show slight economic losses compared to the efficient frontier of a stochastic optimization.
   Context Economic optimization addressing diversification in mixed uneven-aged forest stands is a useful tool for forest planners.
   Aims The study aims to compare two approaches for optimizing rotation age cohort portfolios under risk. Rotation age cohorts emerge from age-based regeneration-harvesting operations simulated for two tree species: Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica.
   Methods The first optimization approach is a stochastic mean-variance approach. The second is a non-stochastic optimization approach, which has rarely been applied to optimize tree species composition and the distribution of harvested timber over many periods. It aims at relatively good solutions, even if the deviation from the initially assumed return is very high. The objective function for both approaches is sensitive to the selection of various harvesting periods for different parts of the stand. For the stochastic approach, the objective function maximizes the annuitized net present value (economic return) for specific levels of risk by allocating area proportions to harvesting periods and tree species. In the non-stochastic approach, the allocation of area proportions instead minimizes the maximum deviation from the greatest possible economic return among many uncertainty scenarios (non-stochastic approach).
   Results Portfolios from both approaches were diverse in rotation age cohorts. The non-stochastic portfolios were more diverse when compared with portfolios from the efficient frontier, which showed the same standard deviation. However, P. abies clearly dominated the non-stochastic portfolios, while stochastic portfolios also integrated beech to a greater extent, but only in very low risk portfolios. The economic losses of the non-stochastic portfolios compared to the efficient frontier of the mean-variance approach lay between 1 and 3% only for different levels of accepted risk.
   Conclusion The non-stochastic portfolio optimization over a large uncertainty space is so far uncommon in forest science, yet provides a viable alternative to stochastic optimization, particularly when available data is scarce. However, further research should consider ecological effects, such as increased resistance against hazards of conifers in mixed stands.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore some of the theoretical and empirical aspects of an economy which includes cultural capital. We use a simple dynamic growth model and the concept of a social accounting matrix (SAM) to illustrate how the addition of income flows and net changes of various natural and cultural resources can be incorporated into a broader measure of welfare. The Swedish reindeer industry, managed by the indigenous Sami people, is used as an example since it is generally regarded to have significant cultural heritage value, beyond its contribution to conventional national accounts. We discuss a theoretically correct compensation to a cultural sector for preserving and maintaining a cultural heritage. Furthermore, we attempt to estimate the cultural value of the Sami Reindeer sector in Sweden using a CVM survey. The results suggest that the willingness to pay (per year) to maintain cultural heritage at least at the current level may be quite substantive, estimates showing it can be several times the industry's turnover per year.

TI  - Techno-Economic Assessment of Four CO<sub>2</sub> Storage Sites
T2  - OIL & GAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-REVUE D IFP ENERGIES NOUVELLES
LA  - English
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) should be a key technology in order to achieve a decline in the CO2 emissions intensity of the power sector and other intensive industry, but this potential deployment could be restricted by cost issues as the International Energy Agency (IEA) in their last projections (World Energy Outlook 2013) has considered only around 1% of global fossil fuel-fired power plants could be equipped with CCS by 2035.
   The SiteChar project funded by 7(th) Framework Programme of European Commission gives the opportunity to evaluate the most influential parameters of techno-economic evaluations of four feasible European projects for CO2 geological storage located onshore and offshore and related to aquifer storage or oil and gas reservoirs, at different stages of characterization.
   Four potential CO2 storage sites have been assessed in terms of storage costs per tonne of CO2 permanently stored (equivalent cost based). They are located offshore UK, onshore Denmark, offshore Norway and offshore Italy. The four SiteChar techno-economic evaluations confirm it is not possible to derive any meaningful average cost for a CO2 storage site. The results demonstrate that the structure of costs for a project is heterogeneous and the storage cost is consequently site dependent. The strategy of the site development is fundamental, the technical choices such as the timing, rate and duration of injection are also important. The way monitoring is managed, using observation wells and logging has a strong impact on the estimated monitoring costs. Options to lower monitoring costs, such as permanent surveys, exist and should be further investigated.
   Table 1 below summarizes the cost range in Euro per tonne (Discount Rate (DR) at 8%) for the different sites, which illustrates the various orders of magnitude due to the specificities of each site. These figures have how to be considered with care. In particular the Italian and Norwegian sites present very specific features that explain the high estimated costs. For the Italian site, the short duration of CO2 injection associated with a low injection rate makes the CO2 project comparable to a demo project. The Norwegian site is an offshore site located in a virgin area with high infrastructure costs and a combination of injection duration and injection rate that makes the derived costs very sensitive to the discount rate.
   [Graphics]
   The results for both UK and Danish sites confirm therefore the value range calculated by the European Technology Platform for Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP).
   The main uncertainties in the costs are linked both to the choice of economic parameters (e.g. injected quantities, contingencies) and to the technical choice of operations. This has been studied by sensitivity analyses: for example, if an injection rate is halved and the injection duration is doubled, the Equivalent Storage Cost (ESC) increases by 23% (UK case at 8% DR). Introducing a water production well and water treatment facilities also increases the ESC by 23%, at least on an onshore site. Techno-economic assessments were basically carried out using an 8% discount rate. For projects of long lifetime such a rate severely discounts the late cash flow, especially after 40 years, so that a discount rate of around 4% more in logic of public investment. Compared to other studies, it has to be noted that the scope of the SiteChar analysis does not consider compression and pumping cost, nor transportation cost. This simplifies the techno-economic evaluation but it may not adequately reflect the specific conditions of the individual developments and, hence, distort the comparison between different cases.
   Lastly, techno-economic evaluation poses questions to policy makers about the real lifetime of a CO2 storage project: what should be the abandon phase and the associated cost and what is the real value of the liability transfer after 20 years of storage? This issue is still an open question, which has been addressed in SiteChar assuming the same approach as ZEP (2011).
   To counterbalance these CO2 storage costs, policy makers have to set up incentives, either through ETS (Emission Trading System) credits, tax credits or public funding. To improve the commerciality of CCS, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) should be taken into account in the regulation of CCS, as it is one of the rare sources for revenue from a commodity with a real market value. CO2 storage in a saline aquifer close to oil and gas fields could also be considered as a source for CO2 EOR.

AB  - Wolves (Canis lupus) have recently expanded their distribution range into western and southern Finland, which has not hosted breeding wolves for over 100 years. This has raised concerns and public debate over wolf-livestock conflicts. Between 1998 and 2004 there were 45 wolf attacks on sheep on 34 farms. To assess the risk wolves may pose to sheep husbandry, we used data on depredation, sheep management, landscape structure and moose and wolf populations from continental Finland outside the area of reindeer husbandry to build models of the factors that may predispose sheep farms to wolf depredation. Our results provided evidence that sheep farms with the highest risk of wolf depredation were those located in regions where wolves were abundant. These farms were usually located close to the Russian border where the landscape is a mosaic of forest, wetlands and clear cut areas. These regions are sparsely populated by humans and farms are located far from each other. Finally, we generated probability maps based on generalised additive modelling to predict the risk of wolf predation on livestock in farms of southern Finland.

AB  - Resin harvesting is a traditional forestry activity that provides economic revenue along with crucial ecosystem services (i.e., fire protection and employment) thus contributing to the socio-economic development of rural areas. In the Iberian Peninsula, Pinus pinaster Aiton has traditionally been exploited for resin to complement the profitability of timber harvesting. Trade-offs between resin yield and radial growth are not fully understood, however. Resin ducts, the anatomical structures that produce and transport resin within the tree, have been used as a proxy for resin yield or resistance to pathogens as they represent the tree's investment on resin defences throughout its lifespan. It is not yet clear if these structures can be linked to growth or how well the resin duct network correlates with resin yield in tapped trees. To answer these questions, we investigate annual tree-ring width, resin duct traits (absolute and standardized), and resin yield of two maritime pine stands tapped for resin extraction in the North of Portugal (VPA and PCO). Resin duct features are assessed before and during tapping periods as may show the constitutive investment, as well as the combination of constitutive and induced ones. Before resin tapping, average tree-ring width in PCO and VPA was -2.25 and -1.13 mm year-1, respectively. During tapping, standardized growth rates increased by ca. 40% in VPA, the population living under lower water availability and shorter growing seasons, while growth rates were almost unaffected in PCO. Median resin production in 2016 was 2.9 kg (PCO) and 1.8 kg (VPA), but inter-tree variance was high in both sites. Resin duct production increased exponentially with tree-ring width similarly in the different sites and for the same periods, but wider rings and ducts in PCO resulted in greater areas occupied by resin ducts. Within the population, constitutive anatomical resin-based defences did not trade-off with radial growth, although, lower growth rates were related to higher resin duct investments in response to tapping. Despite this, annual resin production did not correlate with resin duct density or relative area. Conversely, resin yield was positively associated with trunk perimeter, average growth, and absolute resin duct traits. These variables will thus be the most valuable when trying to identify the best resin producers in a stand. Differences in growth sensitivity to resin tapping between sites suggested that the impact of resin harvesting on radial growth is site-dependent and may not be as negative as previously thought.

TI  - Sami place names and, maps: transmitting knowledge of a cultural landscape in contemporary contexts

KW  - TOPONYMY
KW  - SYSTEMS
AB  - For the Sami people, place names provide the basis for the transmission of a cultural landscape, through an oral way of mapping built around narratives and the designation of specific landmarks. Based on interviews with members of a mountain-based reindeer herding community in Sweden, we found that their transmission is today ensured through continued oral tradition but also by the increasing use of maps. However, because they follow the western cartographic tradition, official maps are unable to express the continual renewal of Sami place names and the land features that are meaningful to the Sami, and thus fail to convey toponymic knowledge. Inscribing place names on maps transforms them into mere labels: toponymic knowledge has to be transmitted along with its context of emergence, situated at the crossroads of cognitive, perceptive, emotional, and social dimensions. There is an urgent need to conceive new forms of cartography that can guarantee the transmission of toponymic knowledge to future generations, maintaining the relationship that binds the Sami to their environment.

AB  - Hiking is a popular leisure activity among people in many industrialised countries. In the case of Norway, a large part of the population goes hiking through forests, mountains and cultural landscapes. What meaning do these hikers attach to their activity? An analysis has been made of letters received from 84 hikers who write about how and why they enjoy their hiking trips. Employing a grounded theory approach, three categories of meaning constructions were identified: a recreation category, a category of the simple outdoors discourse, and a belonging category. In all of these, the hikers see their trips and their further lives in relation to constitutive aspects of modern society. Concepts of rationality and reflexivity were found useful for the interpretation of the meaning contents of each of the categories.

AB  - While wildlife and cultural preservation goals can be either complimentary or counteractive, the goals of large carnivore conservation and traditional pastoralist lifestyles are often at odds. Livestock depredation can negatively impact the economies of livestock herders, while subsequent lethal removals contribute to local carnivore population declines. Here, we collaborated with two Sami reindeer herding communities (2010-2016) situated in Sweden's boreal forest to evaluate the efficacy and economic feasibility of three brown bear predation mitigation measures: corralling pregnant reindeer during parturition, lethal bear management removals, and public bear-license hunting. Calving corrals increased survival for reindeer calves born to average-sized females by 7%-15%, and by 14%-30% for calves born to small females. However, the realized cost of implementing calving corrals outweighed the financial gain for both our study areas (net losses ranged between euro1111 and euro6210 per calf saved from bear predation per year when using the updated 2021 calf value; 1euro [Euro] = US$1.1), as well as for almost every theoretical scenario we explored (net losses euro234 and euro13,995 per calf saved from bear predation). The exception was the theoretical scenario where small herding communities overlapped large bear populations, which crossed the breakeven efficacy bear/reindeer ratio of 13.5 bears/100 reindeer and had a potential net gain of euro36 per saved calf. Similarly, the cost of lethal management removals of bears outweighed the potential financial gain from saved calves, with net losses between euro75 and euro239 per calf. License hunting, where the hunters voluntarily incur the monetary costs of removing bears, is in most cases the only economically viable mitigation measure where the cost of mitigation did not outweigh the financial gain from increased reindeer survival. While the annual public license hunt was the most cost-effective mitigation measure, it may be less biologically effective, that is, bear hunting occurs in the fall and reindeer parturition the following spring which leaves time for the empty niche of harvested bears to be filled by survivors. Economically and biologically effective predation mitigation measures are key for promoting coexistence, and we suggest that potential mitigation measures should be studied in collaboration with local people.

AB  - Time series data on crop yields for two main wind-pollinated crops (barley and wheat) and for three crops benefitting from insect pollination (turnip rapeseed, caraway, and black currant), were compiled from official agricultural statistics. In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.

AB  - We point out problems with the article Productivity beyond density: A critique of management models for reindeer pastoralism in Norway by Marin and co-workers published in Pastoralism in 2020. In our opinion, there are several misleading claims about the governance of the reindeer pastoralist system in Norway, the Roros model for herd management and density dependence in reindeer herds in their article. We point out the errors in their empirical re-evaluation of previous work on the relationship between reindeer densities and the productivity and slaughter weights in herds. These errors have a significant bearing on their conclusions. We agree that weather variability has a substantial impact on reindeer body mass growth, fecundity and survival, but disagree with Marin et al. when they argue that reindeer densities are of minor importance for reindeer productivity and animal welfare.

AB  - This article is based on a selection of Norwegian girls' accounts of backcountry, freeride skiing and mountain biking to better understand how they form and are formed by cultural identity standards. The study is conducted by using the precepts of discourse analysis, which have language and social communication as the central component of the social world. The girls' narratives occupy an ambiguous space that attempts to bridge the gap between their own and other people's perceptions of their identity, gender expression and experience in outdoor adventure sports. Being a skier functions as an anchoring point in their identity formation, binding together incredible experiences out in nature and the recurrent fear of failure. The joy, desire and feeling of freedom in the mountain are challenged by an intense pressure to perform. These ambivalent, sometimes even contradictory experiences are a prominent element of the narrative material produced and analysed in the article.

AB  - The depredation of semi-domesticated reindeer by large carnivores reflects an important human-wildlife conflict in Fennoscandia. Recent studies have revealed that brown bears (Ursus arctos) may kill substantial numbers of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in forest areas in Sweden. Several authors have suggested that predation risk is an important driver of habitat selection in wild Rangifer populations where predation is a limiting factor, but little is known about these mechanisms in semi-domesticated populations. We examined the habitat selection of female reindeer in relation to spatial and temporal variations in brown bear predation risk on the reindeer calving grounds and evaluated the simultaneous responses of brown bears and reindeer to landscape characteristics. We used GPS data from 110 reindeer years (97 individuals) and 29 brown bear years (19 individuals), from two reindeer herding districts in the forest area of northern Sweden. Our results did not indicate that reindeer alter their behavior in response to spatiotemporal variation in brown bear predation risk, on the scale of the calving range. Instead, we suggest that spatiotemporal behavioral adjustments by brown bears were the main driver of prey-predator interactions in our study system. Contrasting responses by brown bears and reindeer to clear-cuts and young forest indicate that forestry can influence species interactions and possibly yield negative consequences for the reindeer herd. Even if clear-cuts may be beneficial in terms of calf survival, logging activity will eventually cause greater abundance of young regenerating forest, reducing available reindeer habitats and increasing habitat preferred by brown bears. Domestication may have made semi-domesticated reindeer in Fennoscandia less adapted to cope with predators. Areal restrictions, limiting the opportunity for dispersion and escape, possibly make the calves more susceptible to predation. Also, a generally higher population density in semi-domesticated herds compared to wild populations can make dispersion a less efficient strategy and the reindeer calves easier prey. Overall, the lack of ability of the reindeer females to reduce brown bear encounter risk on the scale of the calving range is probably an important reason for the high brown bear predation rates on reindeer calves documented in our study areas.

AB  - We documented behaviors of Great Pyrenees livestock-guarding dogs toward people, livestock, dogs, horses, reindeer, and bear to determine if they might be suitable for protecting livestock in Norway. None out of 13 dogs showed aggressive behavior towards unfamiliar people, and aggressiveness towards dogs and livestock was also low. However, 91% of the dogs tested chased reindeer. A willingness to chase bears was apparent in all 3 dogs tested. Although the Norwegian strains of the Great Pyrenees are bred mainly for exhibition, they obviously have retained some behavioral patterns important for the livestock-guarding function. Their nonaggressive behavior towards people, dogs, and livestock, and their active reaction towards bears suggest that this breed could be suitable for use as livestock-guardians in Norway. However, the dogs' tendency to chase reindeer is a trait that may cause conflicts in reindeer-herding areas.

AB  - The concept of a bioeconomy has been placed central in formation of a Swedish National Forest Program (NFP). Drawing on Hajer's conceptual framework of storylines, we present a discourse analysis of the working group reports underlying the establishment of the NFP strategy. We ask what stories about Swedish forests come to dominate the NFP process, how well they reflect the commitment of balancing economic, social and environmental interests, and what role the concept of a bioeconomy, has on the formation of these stories. Storylines of Swedish forests in the bioeconomy unite wider European discourses on the bioeconomy and climate change with historical Swedish forest policy discourses, revitalizing a discourse coalition comprising the state and the industry. Particular to the Swedish discourse is the strong emphasis on creating consensus around a single story of the forest-based bioeconomy.

AB  - The goal of this cross-sectional qualitative study was to assess the impact of climate change on Sami youth health, health care access, and health-seeking behaviour. Indigenous research methodology served as the basis of the investigation which utilised focus groups of youths and one-on-one interviews of adult community leaders using a semi-structured, open-ended questions. The results of the focus groups and interviews were then analysed to identify trends. We found that Sami youth mostly associate the implications of climate change to their culture andcultural practices rather than the historical influence the environment had on Sami health. They also take part in unique health-seeking behaviour by utilising both traditional and Western medicine simultaneously but without interaction due to social and structural factors. Our findings suggest that the health of Sami teens is not tied to the environment directly, but through cultural activities.

CP  - 4th Russian/Finnish Symposium on Radiochemistry
AB  - After atmospheric nuclear weapons tests Cs-137 was rather evenly deposited in Finland. In 1986 after the Chernobyl accident Cs-137 was deposited more unevenly. Two legions with low Cs-137 deposition were studied; Lapland and the Helsinki region. The environmental and cultural differencies resulted, however, in high body burdens for the Lapps compared to those found in the Helsinki region. The body burdens of male reindeer herders from Inari reached maximum values (mean 55 000 Bq) in 1965 with a lower maximum (15 000 Bq) in 1987. In the Helsinki region the corresponding maximum (3000 Bq) was found in 1987 and a smaller maximum (1000 Bq) in 1965. Body burdens and hence radiation doses due to fallout cannot be estimated on the basis of deposition data only.

AB  - This article discusses the environmental impacts of leisure activities. Calculations are presented for the time-use, money expenditure and energy use involved in leisure services and goods consumed by Norwegians in 2001. The paper draws upon a two-year project financed by the Research Council of Norway. Leisure consumption represented around 23% of the total energy use within private and public consumption in Norway. The energy intensity of leisure consumption, measured in energy use per amount of expenditure, was 20% lower than that of everyday household consumption but 380% times higher than that of public consumption. Surveys show that around half of Norwegian leisure time is spent at home, with considerable use of electronic goods, but that the major energy users are holidays, outdoor recreation and second homes. Growing mobility in leisure patterns is a dominating problem. Leisure consumption is growing rapidly and energy-intensive forms of leisure consumption are growing fastest. A 10-point strategy for reducing the environmental impacts of leisure consumption is presented, including strategies for changing leisure production, changing patterns of leisure consumption, changing the volume of leisure consumption and utilising leisure as an educational arena.

AB  - Semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are the main prey for lynx (Lynx lynx) in northern Scandinavia. This causes large, but poorly documented, losses of reindeer. Although the compensation schemes differ between Norway and Sweden, there is a legal requirement in both Scandinavian countries that losses of semi-domestic reindeer to large carnivores should be fully compensated. The current level of compensation payment is based on limited data on lynx kill rates on reindeer. The main goal of this study was to quantify lynx kill rates on reindeer across a range of ecological conditions in northern Scandinavia. A total of 35 lynx were monitored during 3667 days. All lynx individuals killed reindeer. However, we observed a high variation in individual kill rates. Kill rates were strongly affected by sex and social status (i.e. females with and without kittens), as well as season and reindeer availability. The highest kill rates were observed in summer for male lynx, and the lowest were observed during winter for solitary lynx at low reindeer density. In summer, several female lynx switched completely to small prey species even at high densities of reindeer. The present political goals for lynx conservation in Scandinavia require that lynx occur in the reindeer husbandry area where reindeer are the only suitable ungulate prey available. Accordingly, it is therefore impossible to have the total prevention of depredation as a management goal. Rather depredation levels must be limited such that they are considered acceptable, and fair compensation payments should be paid. Our study is the first empirical quantification of the magnitude of lynx depredation on semi-domestic reindeer. This is an important step necessary to enable the setting of fair compensation levels and will hopefully lead to a reduction in conflict level concerning the potential impacts that lynx have on reindeer.

AB  - Fire, being both a natural and cultural phenomenon, presents problems in disentangling the historical effect of humans from that of climate change. Here, we investigate the potential impact of humans on boreal fire regimes from a perspective of fuels, ignitions and culture. Two ways for a low technology culture to impact the fire regime are as follows: (i) by altering the number of ignitions and their spatial distribution and timing and (ii) by hindering fire spread. Different cultures should be expected to have quite different impacts on the fire regimes. In northern Fennoscandia, there is evidence for fire regime changes associated with the following: a reindeer herding culture associated with few ignitions above the natural; an era of cattle husbandry with dramatically increased ignitions and somewhat higher fire frequency; and a timber exploitation era with decreasing fire sizes and diminishing fire frequency. In other regions of the boreal zone, such schemes can look quite different, but we suggest that a close look at the resource extraction and land use of different cultures should be part of any analysis of past fire regimes.

AB  - Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors similar to 30 to 50% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-amplified) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire field site in northern Sweden. Only 15% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and similar to 30% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-virus like assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these findings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact host-mediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic.
   IMPORTANCE This work is part of a 10-year project to examine thawing permafrost peatlands and is the first virome-particle-based approach to characterize viruses in these systems. This method yielded > 2-fold-more viral populations (vOTUs) per gigabase of metagenome than vOTUs derived from bulk-soil metagenomes from the same site (J. B. Emerson, S. Roux, J. R. Brum, B. Bolduc, et al., Nat Microbiol 3:870-880, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-018-0190-y). We compared the ecology of the recovered vOTUs along a permafrost thaw gradient and found (i) habitat specificity, (ii) a shift in viral community identity from soil-like to aquatic-like viruses, (iii) infection of dominant microbial hosts, and (iv) carriage of host metabolic genes. These vOTUs can impact ecosystem carbon processing via top-down (inferred from lysing dominant microbial hosts) and bottom-up (inferred from carriage of auxiliary metabolic genes) controls. This work serves as a foundation which future studies can build upon to increase our understanding of the soil virosphere and how viruses affect soil ecosystem services.

AB  - The article discusses how municipal planning and management can enable South Sami and Norse cultural history to contribute to local development in two sparsely populated mountain municipalities in south-east Norway. The authors' methods comprised document studies of relevant planning documents and treatment of single cases, and interviews with actors at different levels, who were responsible for cultural heritage, land use planning, industrial development and reindeer husbandry. The findings revealed that the organization of cultural heritage management was extremely fragmented in terms of responsibilities, activities and localization. Responsibility for managing Norse and Sami cultural heritage is divided between counties and the Sami Parliament, and the municipalities have no legal responsibilities. This fragmentation contributes to the neglect and marginalization of cultural heritage management in general, and especially the management of Sami cultural heritage. The discourse of attractiveness based on competing for in-migration from other municipalities holds a hegemonic position in both municipal master planning and regional planning. The authors conclude that a different approach based on local community development, namely the residential place, should be prioritized, whereby cultural heritage is used to strengthen the inhabitants' knowledge, identity and 'sense of place'.

It presents a study of a Swedish case in which a biological insecticide has been used to fight mosquitoes to reduce the nuisance to the local population. This case involves conflicting values regarding environmental protection. People's right to outdoor life is placed in opposition to long-term risks to biodiversity. Through interviews with local residents, their deliberations on the spraying are analyzed, particularly concerning to what extent and how they describe the situation in moral terms, but also how they acknowledge and use scientific findings in their argumentation.

AB  - Michel Foucault's concept of heterotopia provides a useful tool for understanding the social function of natural spaces. Heterotopian spaces exist inside a social order but are characterized by a relative lack of control and a different set of rules and expectations. This article proposes a typology of the cultural responses to heterotopian natural spaces: the modes of edification, health, deviance, and crisis. Edification means that personal growth or spiritual improvement can be obtained through exposure to natural spaces; in a commoditized form edification also fuels social distinction. The mode of health refers to physical health, but also, in the wider sense of the etymological roots of the word, to wholeness and the holy; examples are the German tradition of nudism and the Norwegian tradition of friluftsliv (outdoor life). Deviation can be seen in political resistance (as in guerilla warfare) and evasion from the law; in a commoditized touristic form it means release,from everyday life. The mode of crisis, a temporary state of unsettlement, can be found in the attempt to find repose in nature, to live through an existential crisis, or, in a commoditized form, in the calculated danger of adventure. The typology is useful,for distinguishing between seemingly similar forms of nature use and to identify, parallels between apparently different forms.

AB  - The influence of reindeer pasturing on high mountain ecosystems in northern Norway was investigated using a landscape-ecological analysis. The most visible impacts of overgrazing are On the vegetation. In addition, soils and humus have been changed due to morphodynamic processes induced to a large extent by reindeer pasturing. Degradation of the high mountain landscapes within the last 30 years is described on 3 spatial levels: large-scale effects at specific localities, linear effects along reindeer fences, and small-scale effects on the altitudinal zonation of entire mountain systems. The structure of the ecosystem ha changed completely due to reindeer pasturing, which has resulted in landscape degradation under great pasturing pressure. The processes that influence the ecosystem as a function of different pasture intensities are described and show a complex correlation and interaction between the ecofactors. These include destruction of vegetation cover, reduction of roof density, erosion of humus and mineral soil horizons, reduction of soil moisture and soil stability, and changes in plant species composition. On the whole, degradation leads to a depression of the altitudinal belts, indicated by the new organization of the ecosystems. It can be concluded that reindeer herding at current levels is a destructive form of land use in the northern Norwegian high mountains and hence is not sustainable. The author believes that destruction of the natural environment could be reversed, although this is not to be expected.

AB  - In this article, we engage with environmental conflicts on indigenous land through a focus on an attempt to gain social licence to reopen and operate the Biedjovaggi mine in Guovdageainnu/Kautokeino in Sapmi, Norway. We argue that mining prospects bring forth ontological conflicts concerning land use, as well as ways to know the landscape and the envisioned future that the land holds. It is a story of a conflict between two different ways of knowing. The paper explores the Sami landscape through different concepts, practices and stories. We then contrast this to the way the same landscape is understood and narrated by a mining company, through the programmes and documents produced according to the Norwegian law and standards. We follow Ingold's argument that the Sami landscape practices are taskscapes, where places, times and tasks are interconnected. These were not acknowledged in the plans and documents of the mining company. We conclude by addressing the tendency of extractive industries to reduce different landscapes in ways that fit with modern understandings, which oppose culture to nature.

AB  - Controversy between alternative uses of forests in Finnish Upper Lapland has been going on for decades, and in recent years it has been escalated to a serious conflict. The core of the conflict is the adverse impacts of forestry on old forests which are important grazing areas for reindeer and which are regarded as intact nature and wilderness areas. This paper describes the experiences of applying multi-criteria decision analysis interview approach on this conflict. The approach provides tools for structuring the problem and preferences of the stakeholders as well as for analyzing the effects of different alternatives in a common framework. We focus on the practical experiences gained from the application of this approach in this context. Multi-criteria decision analysis was found to be a useful approach to evaluate the economic, ecological and cultural aspects of this intense conflict. The obtained experiences also support the view that the approach works best when tightly integrated into the planning process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cooperation between Sami actors and environmentalists in the resistance of loggings in the conflict over forestry in Inari, in Finnish Sapmi, in the 2000s has been presented as a cohesive alliance, innovative in creating new political space and channels of influence. Looking more closely, there were foundational non-aligning factors causing friction to the alliance, relating to the legitimacy of the presence of the non-human in the biotic system. I shall examine as to what extent and why the frames employed aligned or conflicted. One way to grasp the fragility of the frame alignment is to study the opinions held by the different actors about what needs restoring/conserving, whether these are economic, ecological, or cultural elements, or a combination of these, and how the entities to be protected were situated in time. The historical context of this article is the long series of forestry conflicts in Inari, for the duration of which the transformations and varying strategies of alignment of environmental, herder, and forestry frames are studied. It is argued that the combination and number of the non-human animals to be protected were one root cause for misalignment, deepening the rifts between environmentalists and the Sami to this day.

AB  - Aim Animal migrations influence ecosystem structure, dynamics and persistence of predator and prey populations. The theory of migratory coupling postulates that aggregations of migrant prey can induce large-scale synchronized movements in predators, and this coupling is consequential for the dynamics of ecological communities. The degree to which humans influence these interactions remains largely unknown. We tested whether creation of large resource pulses by humans such as seasonal herding of reindeer Rangifer tarandus and hunting of moose, Alces alces, can induce migratory coupling with Golden Eagles, Aquila chrysaetos, and whether these lead to demographic consequences for the eagles. Location Fennoscandia. Methods We used movement data from 32 tracked Golden Eagles spanning 125 annual migratory cycles over 8 years. We obtained reindeer distribution data through collaboration with reindeer herders based on satellite tracking of reindeer, and moose harvest data from the national hunting statistics for Sweden. We assessed demographic consequences for eagles from ingesting lead from ammunition fragments in moose carcasses through survival estimates and their links with lead concentrations in eagles' blood. Results In spring, eagles migrated hundreds of kilometres to be spatially and temporally coupled with calving reindeer, whereas in autumn, eagles matched their distribution with the location and timing of moose hunt. Juveniles were more likely to couple with reindeer calving, whereas adults were particularly drawn to areas of higher moose harvest. Due to this coupling, eagles ingested lead from spent ammunition in moose offal and carcasses and the resulting lead toxicity increased the risk of mortality by 3.4 times. Main conclusions We show how migratory coupling connects landscape processes and that human actions can influence migratory coupling over large spatial scales and increase demographic risks for predators. We provide vital knowledge towards resolving human-wildlife conflicts and the conservation of protected species over a large spatial and temporal scale.

AB  - Reindeer racing is a sport that is unique to the Scandinavian and Russian Arctic countries. The paper is based on fieldwork carried out in Finnish Lapland in which the process of training race reindeer and the reindeer race competition is examined. It gives some insight into the cultural practices that are used by Finnish reindeer herders in Lapland to train reindeer to race and the relationship that is nurtured between the race reindeer and the trainer. This paper focuses primarily on two key ethnographic interviews from the field and uses additional fieldwork data to support the points of discussion. It gives insight into the concept of ownership and what is considered to be a 'good' race reindeer. The reindeer trainer's understanding of the semi-domesticated reindeer challenges the concept of what it means to be 'wild.' This is taken into consideration in an examination of the process of the further domestication and training of the reindeer to race. The research explored the nature of the racing environment, the uniqueness of the reindeer racing event and aspects that makes it traditional and appealing for both international tourists and spectators from the north.

TI  - Vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) winter seine fishing in the Kuusamo area, northern Finland, with implications on stock dynamics
T2  - ADVANCES IN LIMNOLOGY 46: BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 1993
LA  - English
CP  - 5th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes
AB  - Winter seine fishing began in the lakes of the Kuusamo area at the beginning of the 1970's as a part-time activity combined with agriculture and reindeer husbandry. The effort and the yield stayed quite constant (averaging 5-10 kg/ha/lake) until the first half of the 1980's. During the last ten years the number of seine crews has almost doubled and harvest rates has increased up to 10-20 kg/ha/lake mainly as a consequence of technical development of gear, good marketing opportunities, state financial support and also renewal of the Finnish Fishery Act which now favour professional fishermen. Technical development of equipment and gear increased the profitability of seining by bath increasing yield per crew and lowering the number of fishermen per crew from 4-6 to 2-3. Average gross turnover income of winter seine crew at the end of 1980's was about 80000 Fmk. Vendace growth rate, body condition and recruitment indicated that density-dependent intra-specific processes dominate in the vendace population dynamics in the lakes studied Consequently, size (growth rate) of 0+ vendace in combination with winter seine catch per unit effort data and yield time-series should be included in a lake specific management model. In order to secure a profitable and sustainable fishery, a recommended strategy for vendace fisheries management would be a reduction of abundance to a population level optimizing growth rate, recruitment and economic yield (i.e., mean size of catchable fish) combined with a further development of marketing and processing of small-sized vendace. As a conclusion, when managing the fishery one must consider both the optimization of the harvesting from an ecological point of view and the economics ruling the exploitation of the stock.

AB  - Environmental organizations play an important role in mainstream debates on nature and in shaping our environments. At a time when environmental NGOs are turning to questions of gender-equality and ethnic diversity, we analyze their possibilities to do so. We argue that attempts at ethnic and cultural diversity in environmental organizations cannot be understood without insight into the conceptualizations of nature and the environment that underpin thinking within the organization. Serious attempts at diversity entail confronting some of the core values on nature-cultures driving the organization as well as understanding the dimensions of power such as class, gender, and race that structure its practices. We study what nature means for one such organization, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, and the ways in which thinking about nature dictates organizational practice and sets the boundaries of their work with diversity in their projects on outdoor recreation. We base our analysis on official documents and interviews, analyze how "diversity" and "gender-equality" are represented in the material and reflect on the interconnections as well as the different trajectories taken by the two issues. Our study shows that the organization's understanding of nature is a central and yet undiscussed determinant of their work with diversity that closes down as much as it opens up the space for greater inclusion of minorities. We argue that for environmental organizations wanting to diversity membership, a discussion of what nature means for people and their relationships to each other and nature is vital to any such efforts.

AB  - In Sweden's Norrbotten County, a "green transition" driven by market demand and new normative structures is underway, creating a regional mega-project designed to put Sweden at the forefront of emerging green industries. These industries, such as carbon-neutral steel fabrication, battery production, and data center hosting, all require large amounts of energy, land, and minerals. This paper applies the regional environmental governance framework to Arctic data to examine which stakeholders have the capacity to impose their agenda on the Arctic environment and the points of conflict and collaboration during this period of accelerated growth. The paper tests the assumption that regional governance accommodates a plurality of interests. A case study examining Norrbotten County's industrial mega-project centered around Lulea, Sweden, identifies a dominant coalition uniting government and industry that supports norms seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this region. However, the existing regional governance model does a poor job of integrating the local Indigenous Sami preferences for land use. At the core of the difference between actors advancing the green economy and the local Sami reindeer herders are divergent conceptions of nature and sustainability.

AB  - Activities in natural environments greatly enhance human well-being and can support the integration of foreigners into a new country. This article explores how residents from different ethnic backgrounds in Turku, Finland appreciated and engaged with urban natural environments and how this engagement benefitted their well-being and, ultimately, their integration. Individuals enjoy activities in nature in particular ways, which may vary according to a person's physical, social, and psychological characteristics. This is especially true for immigrants who apply traditions from their home countries to the ways in which they interact with their new environment and enjoy activities in nature. Three dimensions of nature experience-social, emotional, and normative-emerged from the research, which, in turn, supported well-being and different types of integration: interactive, identificational, and cognitive. We argue that because these dimensions are an integral part of a person's identity and cultural background, familiarity with them may prove pivotal to constructing more welcoming and intercultural urban natural environments. Different approaches to engaging with nature should be considered in the design of urban environments and urban nature, as well as in integration programmes, to enhance the well-being and integration of foreign-background populations.

AB  - Pink salmon have returned to Norwegian rivers at high abundance in recent odd-numbered years (2017, 2019, 2021, 2023), presenting potential threats to native biodiversity and ecosystem services, including major sport fishing tourism for Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout in Norway. Presently, there exists a knowledge gap on angler perceptions and attitudes towards the presence of pink salmon in Norwegian rivers, resulting in difficulty assessing the socioeconomic repercussions of their invasion.We distributed an online questionnaire to anglers who purchased the national salmon fishing licence in Norway in 2020 to assess their perceptions of pink salmon and the intentions of anglers to modify their fishing practices.There were widespread negative perceptions of pink salmon in Norway. Perceptions were matched with intentions to modify fishing behaviour among some of the anglers, with 41% saying that they would modify fishing to increase the catch of pink salmon to help remove them before they spawned in the rivers. However, anglers were more prone to say they would decrease fishing effort if both pink salmon catches and fishing licence costs were to increase or if pink salmon were to dominate their catch.Salmon anglers in Norway were strongly oriented towards their chosen recreational activity and do not plan to stop fishing their preferred rivers. They also do not want pink salmon to become established in Norway and are prepared to volunteer for stewardship roles that intervene against pink salmon. However, they overwhelmingly reported not wanting to eat pink salmon.Fisheries managers must take into account the widespread desire for management intervention against pink salmon, even though eradication is not likely no matter how intensive removal efforts become. Efforts to change narratives about pink salmon to encourage fishers to harvest pink salmon from the fjords and rivers for consumption might lead to effective population control, relieving native salmon, trout and charr from potential negative impacts of this prolific colonizer.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Pukkellaks har vandret opp i norske elver i store mengder de siste oddetallsarene (2017, 2019, 2021, 2023), og utgjor en potensiell trussel mot naturmangfold og okosystemtjenester, inkludert den store sportsfisketurismen etter laks og sjoorret i Norge. Det har v AE rt et kunnskapsgap nar det gjelder sportsfiskeres oppfatninger og holdninger til pukkellaks i norske elver, noe som gjor det vanskelig a vurdere de sosiookonomiske konsekvensene av pukkellaksinvasjonen.Vi sendte et nettbasert sporreskjema til sportsfiskere som kjopte laksefiskeravgifta i Norge i 2020, for a vurdere deres oppfatninger av pukkellaks og om de hadde intensjoner om a endre fiskepraksis.Det var utbredte negative oppfatninger av pukkellaks i Norge. Oppfatningene matchet intensjonene om a endre fiskeatferd hos noen av sportsfiskerne, og 41% av fiskerne sa at de ville endre fiskeatferd for a oke fangsten av pukkellaks og bidra til a fjerne dem for de gyter. Imidlertid var sportsfiskere mer tilboyelige til a si at de ville redusere fiskeinnsatsen hvis bade fangst av pukkellaks og fiskekostnadene skulle oke, eller hvis pukkellaks skulle dominere fangstene.Laksefiskere i Norge var sterkt fokusert pa fritidsaktiviteten sin og hadde ikke planer om a slutte a fiske i sine hovedelver. De onsket heller ikke at l skulle etablere seg i Norge og var villige til a bidra med a fjerne pukkellaks. Imidlertid rapporterte de i stor grad at de ikke onsket a spise pukkellaks.Fiskeforvaltningen ma ta hensyn til det utbredte onsket om forvaltningsinnsats mot pukkellaks, selv om full utryddelse er lite sannsynlig uansett hvor intensiv bekjempingen blir. Forsok pa a endre oppfatningen om pukkellaks for a oppmuntre fiskere til matauk av pukkellaks i fjordene og elvene, kan bidra til bestandskontroll og begrense mulige negative konsekvenser pa naturlig forekommende bestander av laks, sjoorret og sjoroye.

AB  - Many of today's pilgrim routes are not only conceived of as religious thoroughfares. They are also seen as historical and cultural routes and are embraced by heritage polices and the tourism industry. It follows from this that contemporary pilgrim routes are endowed with many meanings and expectations, both in the public and private spheres. While much research has focused its attention on the diversity of motives, experiences and symbolic meaning processes among those who embark on journeys along pilgrim routes, less attention has been paid to the varieties of stakeholders involved. By exploring how different types of stakeholders engage with a recently reinvented pilgrim route in Norway, it is shown how this route represents a contested space. Among various stakeholders involved in the development and the management of the pilgrimage, as well as stakeholders who take an interest in the material and symbolic benefits one could possibly draw from it, there are disagreements on what kind of heritage pilgrimage should represent. The differing approaches are basically represented by those who want to promote religious motivations, traditionalist outdoor recreation interests and stakeholders who primarily want to develop and market the pilgrim route in a touristic context. While distinctions between categories such as pilgrims and tourists, or vacationers and religious travellers, are becoming more and more blurred, opposing and partly intersecting discourses among stakeholders tend in this case to result in the upholding of these kinds of distinctions. This implies that travellers along pilgrim route are not left to themselves with their experiences and practices. While some stakeholders take an interest in what pilgrims are doing, in the sense that they want to profit from it, others are concerned about questions of whom a pilgrim is and for whom a pilgrim route is for.

AB  - In this paper, we add to the literature by exploring how sustainable development (SD) and sustainability-oriented learning, are reflected in the Swedish compulsory school and upper secondary school physical education and health (PEH) syllabi. The source of data was the PEH syllabi and the commentary material, as produced by the Swedish National Agency of Education. These were qualitatively analysed through document and thematic analysis using two educational guideline resources as guiding frameworks. We found no explicit statements related to SD in the PEH syllabi for the compulsory school and upper secondary school. In the commentary materials, however, there were explicit statements made in relation to outdoor life and nature and ergonomics. We also found links possible between the PEH syllabi and totally five SDGs as the syllabi stands today. Our analysis signals a lack of conceptualisation of SD, but also openings for working with these perspectives, and to address these in the Swedish PEH syllabi.

AB  - In multi-functional mountainous landscapes worldwide, conservation of natural values is a major task. Here, pro-active policies can be a way forward. National Environmental Quality Objectives (EQO) to solve environmental problems for future generations, however, often wrestle with being too visionary and lacking specificity, which complicates their implementation. The EQO A Magnificent Mountain Landscape that has been adopted by the Swedish Parliament in 1999 to preserve the pristine mountain environment in Sweden, experiences all these flaws. To aid its implementation, we studied the conditions and processes needed to define, to evaluate, and to preserve its goals across the Swedish mountain chain, using one of its milestone targets (a landscape characterized by grazing) as a study system. Applying qualitative and quantitative methods, we analyzed three types of data: 1) referral responses to the governmental strategy document, 2) interviews with relevant actors, and 3) environmental monitoring data (reindeer position data). Nationally, our results suggest a need for geographical differentiation to match regional/local conditions. Regionally, difference in both perception and definition of the milestone target among the actors hinders the formulation, monitoring, and evaluation of a common goal. Next to a culture-nature divide, we found that a within as a user and from the outside as an observer perspective influenced suggested definitions. Moreover, we found a need for better defining whether the goal is maintaining current conditions or restoring previous ones. Our result supports the use of animal position data as a decision support tool to monitor and to aid evaluation of the target. Given the number of actors involved and conflicts of interests present, we suggest the application of a structured decision process to accomplish agreements on a common goal. Here, environmental monitoring data can aid a landscape assessment step as a natural part in the decision process to target landscape management actions resourcefully and effectively.

KW  - The Kautokeino Rebellion
AB  - Over the last couple of decades, film and filmmaking has become an increasingly powerful dimension to indigenous peoples' cultural and political revival, worldwide. Many "indigenous films" deal with the past, aiming at rectifying alleged misrepresentations or neglect of the given indigenous community's past in the discourses of dominant society. This article explores the cultural memory-making of one such film, The Kautokeino Rebellion (2008) directed by leading Sami filmmaker Nils Gaup. The film adapts the story of a mortal rebellion in 1852, where a group of Sami reindeer herders killed the chief of police and the local merchant. The incident is the perhaps most traumatic and stigmatized event in the history of the indigenous population of Sami in Norway, with dominant interpretations being highly condemning of the Sami involved. Gaup's movie redresses such perspectives, and places responsibility for the tragic events on Norwegian authorities and discriminatory policies towards the Sami. Emphasis in this article is on the mechanisms and preconditions at play as The Kautokeino Rebellion gained significant impact in terms of altering the cultural memory of the event. Focus is on the film itself, its broader cultural context and its reception.

AB  - Alpine plant life is proliferating, biodiversity is on the rise and the mountain world appears more productive and inviting than ever. Upper range margin rise of trees and low-altitude (boreal) plant species, expansion of alpine grasslands and dwarf-shrub heaths are the modal biotic adjustments during the past few decades, after a century of substantial climate warming in the Swedish Scandes. This course of biotic landscape evolution has reached historical dimensions and broken a multi-millennial trend of plant cover retrogression, alpine tundra expansion, floristic and faunal impoverishment, all imposed by progressive and deterministic neoglacial climate cooling. Continued modest warming over the present century will likely be beneficial to alpine biodiversity, geoecological stability, resilience, sustainable reindeer husbandry and aesthetic landscape qualities. These aspects are highlighted by an integrative review of results from long-term monitoring of subalpine/alpine vegetation in the Swedish Scandes. This forms the basis for some tentative projections of landscape transformations in a potentially warmer future. Notably, these results and projections are not necessarily valid in other regions and differ in some respects from model predictions. Continued monitoring is mandatory as a basis for generation of more realistic vegetation and ecosystem models.

AB  - It is obvious that nature plays a key role in nature-based tourism. But how important are natural environments for nature-based tourism supply? What kind of natural environments are demanded, and how can or should such environments be accessed? These issues are addressed in this paper using a two-dimensional model of the nature-based tourism servicescape. Based upon a grounded theory mixed-method approach, we analyze to what extent nature-based tourism companies in Sweden depend upon natural environments and facilities (naturalness dimension), and open access and exclusive rights to natural resources (access dimension). Findings show that this sector considers open access much more important than exclusive rights, while naturalness and facilities both represent important attributes. The exception being companies providing extractive activities (e.g. hunting), in particular those with a majority of international customers, where exclusive rights to resources are much more important. This paper provides new knowledge how the nature-based tourism industry can be supported through nature protection, sustainable management of natural resources, public infrastructure and access policies.

AB  - Mining can have a notable environmental and social footprint both during the production phase and after the mine closure. We examined local stakeholders' viewpoints on two post-mining areas in northern Finland, Hannukainen and Rautuvaara, using a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) approach. Spatially explicit data on local residents' and visitors' values, knowledge needs, and future perspectives on mining landscapes were collected with an online map-based survey tool (Harava). The results show that post-mining sites were generally considered unpleasant places. A majority of respondents were of the opinion that areas would need better reclamation and landscaping measures. The landscape surrounding the post-mining sites contained a wide diversity of pleasant places with high nature and recreational value. Respondents addressed various environmental concerns related to the impacts of former mining activities on the quality of ground water and surface water, potential soil contamination, and the safety of natural products. Opinions on the planned mine reopening were strongly divided among the respondents. One of the key questions was whether a large open-pit mine and nature-based tourism can coexist in the same region. Our results highlight that "the shadow of the mine"-observed environmental impacts, uncertainties related to the spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of impacts, and knowledge gaps-can affect local stakeholders' land use far outside the mining sites and long after the mine closure. Identifying and mapping stakeholder values, opinions, and knowledge needs could significantly improve post-mining land use planning and mitigate the loss of multifunctional landscapes.

AB  - Aoluguya Reindeer is the only reindeer population in China. In recent years, habitat loss and inbreeding have led to population decline, and population growth has been slow, maintaining a thousand or so. To better protect the Aoluguya Reindeer and improve its fecundity, we have introduced reindeer from Finland, crossbreeding help us to reach this goal. However, it is lacking in the study of genetic diversity of reindeer in China and Finland. Therefore, we used the partial sequences of the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA to analyze the genetic diversity of Chinese reindeer (Aoluguya Reindeer) and the introduced Finnish reindeer, and identified twenty-six haplotypes, including nineteen in China, five in Finland, and two in Russia. There is no shared haplotype among them. The nucleotide diversity of Aoluguya Reindeer is 0.00752, which is significantly lower than that of reindeer in Finland and other countries. The haplotype and phylogenetic analysis show that reindeer from different geographical origins are not clustered completely according to geographical distribution. Aoluguya Reindeer populations and the introduced reindeer herds from Finland are all closely related to the reindeer from Russia. AMOVA analysis showed that there was significant differentiation between reindeer populations in China and Finland, and mismatch analysis showed that both populations had not experienced expansion. In this study, we identified the genetic diversity of Aoluguya Reindeer and the introduced reindeer, and provided a scientific basis for the conservation and breeding of Aoluguya Reindeer resources.

AB  - This article analyzes the published journals of two Lutheran clergymen active in the Sami areas of the early nineteenth century Nordic countries, Petrus Laestadius (Sweden) and Jacob Fellman (Finland). The article focuses on the ways Laestadius and Fellman described the transition from nomadism to agriculture that many Sami individuals undertook in the nineteenth century, following a couple of centuries of agricultural colonization of the Sami areas of Sweden and Finland. The aim of this article is to illuminate and examine the various degrees between the categories ` sedentary settler' and the `nomadic Sami'. What kind of in-between positions did this seemingly binary pair of concepts conceal? The article contributes to our understanding of the ways indigenous peoples were perceived in the early nineteenth century and how their livelihoods were coded in relation to dominant ideals of national economy and civilization. The focus on the in-between positions between `settlers' and `nomads' reveals important complexities in the views of the clergymen. It uncovers various, at times contradictory definitions of culture and civilization. The article also concludes that while the priority of agriculture as the main livelihood of both Sweden and Finland was clear, this view was challenged by the notion of the sustainable Sami livelihood of large-scale reindeer herding.

AB  - Ingestion doses between and within countries are expected to vary significantly due to differences in dietary habits and geographical variations in radionuclide concentrations. This paper presents the most comprehensive assessment to date of the effective radiation dose from the Norwegian diet, from natural as well as anthropogenic radionuclides. Ingestion doses to the Norwegian public are calculated using national dietary statistics and the most relevant radionuclide concentration data for the various food products. The age-weighted average effective dose received by the Norwegian population from the diet is estimated at 0.41 mSv y(-1) from naturally occurring radionuclides and 0.010 mSv y(-1) from anthropogenic radionuclides. This is approximately 50% higher than the estimated world average. Fish and shellfish is the food group that provides the largest dose contribution from the average Norwegian diet. Although the average dose from anthropogenic radionuclides today is low, the exposure may still be significant for certain critical groupsespecially persons who consume large amounts of reindeer meat from the regions that received significant radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl accident. Furthermore, persons with high Rn-222 concentrations in their drinking water are among those receiving the highest ingestion doses in Norway.

AB  - This article explores the linkages between nature-based recreation and preferences of individuals classified as "environmentalists". Following an overview of the literature, this paper reports on an empirical investigation of the nature-based recreation vs. environmentalism nexus using data from a national Swedish survey. Study findings show that environmentalists (environmentally-oriented individuals) behave differently in terms of their recreation-related preferences when compared to non-environmentalists. Environmentalists prefer outdoor activities with little or no impact on the environment as demonstrated, for example, by their avoidance of extractive (e.g. hunting) and motorized activities (e.g. snowmobiling). Despite these differences, the findings were inconsistent in that while environmentalists avoid some extractive and motorized activities, other similar activities were not avoided. Thus, the results question the use of simplistic recreational classification systems for the understanding of activity preferences and the authors call for more in-depth, qualitative research to further understand the nature-based recreation choices of environmentalists. Study findings also show that environmentally-oriented individuals do not hesitate to travel away from residential areas for participation in nature-based recreation. Therefore, this paper helps us to understand which nature-based activities environmentalists demand and can provide a more informed basis for tourism planning and management.

AB  - In Sweden, pilgrimages have emerged as new, re-created, late modern rites, taking advantage of historical roots and contemporary international developments. Yet, the Swedish pilgrimages have their own specificities. Pilgrimages are arranged as group activities with a focus on walking, and the place to which the pilgrimage is made has lost its significance as a holy place. Instead, nature, outdoor life and especially silence are important means for spiritual experiences, and holy places are perceived in an individualized manner along the trail. The highly appreciated silent walk creates a sacred space during the pilgrimage where experiences of spirituality as well as of self-transformation can take place. The author discusses pilgrimage concepts such as structure, place, space and spirituality from a Swedish perspective.
   Resume En Suede, les pelerinages ont emerge en tant que derniers rites modernes, nouveaux et re-crees, beneficiant de racines historiques et de developpements internationaux contemporains. Cependant, les pelerinages suedois ont leurs propres specificites. Les pelerinages sont des activites de groupes se focalisant sur la marche alors que le lieu de pelerinage lui-meme a perdu sa signification de place sacree. La nature, la vie en exterieur, et specialement le silence, sont d'importants moyens d'experiences spirituelles, et le long du chemin, les places sacrees sont percues de maniere individualisee. La marche silencieuse hautement appreciee cree un espace sacre au sein duquel les experiences de spiritualite et d'auto-transformation peuvent prendre place. L'auteure discute les concepts lies au pelerinage tels que structure, lieu, espace et spiritualite a partir d'une perspective suedoise.

AB  - Democratic societies' emphasis on individual rights and freedoms inevitably opens them up to political disputes. Conflict management should thus be seen as an integral part of democratic institutional design. The evolution and management of policy disputes concerning the use of different natural resources in Finland is analysed by using the theoretical models of frame analysis and strategic interaction. The studied disputes include lake fisheries, watercourse regulation, reindeer herding, and forestry. The institutional design in the case studies varies. Despite the differences, many common features are identified that could explain their successes or difficulties in achieving sustainable and cooperative use of the resources. Among these are problems involving complex and uncertain knowledge, differences in frames held by multiple users of a resource, and distrust between the users and other parties. The analysis concludes with preliminary conclusions on how various disputes related to sustainable resource use could be managed. These include addressing the knowledge and frame problems in order to initiate a learning process; establishing sub-processes in which mutual trust between the parties - including a managing authority or a third party - can emerge; giving explicit roles and a clear division of entitlement to the parties; and providing a credible alternative for co-operation that affects the parties' payoff assessments during the process. Finally, the conflict management process shouldn't be regarded as a distinct phase of dispute resolution, but as an essential aspect of ongoing co-management practices of resource use.

AB  - Sustainable forestry is practised in Finnish Lapland north of latitude 69degrees, i.e. farther north than anywhere else in the world. The Protection Forests Act was passed in 1922 to guarantee the stability of timberline forests in this climatically extreme, unique area. This review, based on earlier studies, covers forest and climate statistics, and legislation, regulations and recommendations of forest management, and the effects of management practices and climatic trends on the results of natural and artificial regeneration of conifer forests, as well as on shifts in the timberline. The review is mainly based on Finnish research, but references from the other Fennoscandian countries have also been used. Temperature plays the main role in forest regeneration success, and the effective temperature sum has been found to express well the location of the Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) timberline. Natural regeneration of pine has been satisfactory, especially when combined with soil preparation. In many cases the pine forests regenerate in the form of advance growth without any silvicultural action. The success of artificial regeneration seems to be associated with favourable, warm periods lasting for at least 20 yrs. The effects of cutting, forest fires, reindeer herding, biotic damage and air pollution on forest regeneration and the conifer timberlines are discussed.

Based on ethnographic fieldwork, we show how these potential mining interventions create 'open moments', turbulent events that destabilizes established claims to land. We analyse how actors such as reindeer herders, indigenous groups, local and national government and mining companies make claims to land, (i.e territorialising it) by drawing on discourses on environmental responsibility, sustainability, indigeneity or growth. By paying attention to language and knowledge production, we show how a multiplicity of actors narrate territory into being, allowing us to go beyond conventional notions of territory as produced 'from above' by the state or by counterterritorial movements 'from below'. By 'freezing time' in the unfolding of the open moments we lend all these 'territorial narratives' equal space, in order to analyse the connection between actors and their relation to land. This allow us to show connections between what might otherwise be perceived as locked and antagonistic positions, but also how ongoing processes of territorialisation are influenced by and change peoples' subject positions as the open moment unfolds on the ground.

AB  - Contemporary planning for urban densification permits the exploitation of the spacious green areas developed for recreation during the welfare planning of the 1960s-70s. Historical studies of welfare planning are needed to better understand the potential values under threat. Answering Colin McFarlane's call for relational studies of density, this paper offers a complementary examination of the relational geography of green space provision in the 1970s, to reveal what the development of the compact city both silences and (literally) replaces. This relational approach departs from the flat ontology of Actor-network theory. The study captures how ideals of recreation, nature, welfare, planning and the rhythms of life assembled into a geography for recreation in the early 1970s, and how this topology crumbles a decade later. While the green spaces of the 1970s linger on today, their reinterpretation as green structure in the 1980s and 1990s partly veils their former role and potential. The paper interprets the legacy of welfare planning, and provides a base for further examination of the geography of green space provision.

AB  - Community-based vulnerability assessment has often assumed that the local is the relevant level of adaptation to climate change. This paper suggests that not only do a number of levels from the international to the regional influence which adaptations can take place locally, but the governance network that is made up by actors on different levels may to a large extent be formed in responses to globalising factors, such as internationalisation of economies and the changing role of the state. The paper presents a study of adaptation in reindeer (Rangifier tarandus) herding, forestry and fishing communities in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with a focus on assessing stakeholders' own perceptions of environmental, socio-political and economic factors that affect them. In general, the paper illustrates the integration of non-subsistence economies into large and complex interactions where local adaptation is a result of the sum of stresses impacting individual entrepreneurs, and the potential they have to adapt their practices given governance (and their access to support) on different scales.

AB  - In northern Fennoscandia, the spatial and temporal grazing practices of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) vary, which implies different grazing effects dependent on natural conditions as well as management regime (i.e., timing and intensity of grazing). We compared density and biomass of main plant groups in semi-dry mountain birch forests exposed to either long-term summer or winter grazing in three reindeer herding districts in the northernmost Finland. Percent plant cover, height, and biomass of reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) and dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium uliginosum, Calluna vulgaris, and Betula nana) were lower on summer ranges compared with winter ranges. The biomass of other dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea), and graminoids and herbs, and the % cover of non-vegetated bare soil and litter were, however, higher on summer ranges than on winter ranges. Young mountain birch shoots (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) were less frequent on summer ranges than on winter ranges. The total leaf biomass under the browsing height of reindeer (<1.5 m) was also lower on summer ranges compared with winter ranges. Especially in drier and nutrient poor mountain birch forests, intensive summer grazing reduces the quantity of lichens and total plant biomass which affects the ecological state and productivity of these forests and also reduces especially their winter grazing value for reindeer. Therefore, in addition to regulating the maximum sustained numbers of reindeer, pasture rotation systems that effectively protect dry and nutrient poor vegetation from summer grazing and trampling should be encouraged.

AB  - A literature review on reindeer pastoralism was performed to assess research trends within this multifaceted field. A machine learning topic modelling approach was applied on abstracts retrieved online. The methodology offers a computational tool to find relevant themes by capturing meaningful structure among large collections of documents. Ten topics were identified. The three fastest expanding topics were related to "Space use", "Climate change" and "Socio-cultural" aspects. They are interrelated and reflect the main challenges herders and reindeer are facing as their land use competes with an expanding resource extraction industry, arguably for facilitating the Green shift. Climate change thus indirectly influence the herders' rights to land and resources and form of life. The "Socio-cultural" topic outnumbers the other topics during the last decade. The dominating natural science argument encompasses four topics: "Space use", "Climate change", "Herd productivity" and "Grazing and Vegetation". Research across disciplines is still in its infancy, and an integration between social and ecological issues through a multidisciplinary approach demands for a deeper understanding of the future challenges faced by reindeer pastoralism.

AB  - Opposition to mines endures even in countries with relatively strong environmental assessment processes and regulations. Why proposed mines fail to obtain a social license to operate is analyzed by developing a framework comprised of three concepts-process legitimacy, distributional outcomes, and values compatibility-drawing from the social license to operate, interactive governance, and environmental justice literatures. The framework is applied to understand opposition from local Indigenous people to two mine projects, one in Sweden and the other in British Columbia, Canada. Evidence from interviews with Sami legal experts and Reindeer Herding Community representatives and an advisor with the Tsilhqot'in National Government, as well as from secondary sources is used to analyze the contestation. Despite the proposed mines being situated in different governance contexts, the reasons for the opposition are markedly similar environmental assessment processes are illegitimate, distributional outcomes unfair, and values incompatible. The comparative empirical analysis leads to refining the framework as a scaffold with values compatibility as the foundational plank, rather than three independent planks contributing to a social license to operate. The analysis offers insights into company commitments to Indigenous engagement, enhancements to process legitimacy, and evolving and paradigmatic shifts in governance processes, as articulated by Indigenous peoples and international governance mechanisms such as the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

AB  - To what extent do Swedish Samis identify their ethnicity as Sami, Swedish, or both? How do they meet various criteria for being allowed to register as voters to the Sami Parliament? What factors predict ethnicities? These questions are studied in randomised samples from the electoral roll for the Sami Parliament. Applying Berry's model of acculturation, four types are constructed-separated, assimilated, integrated, and marginalised. The findings show that the integrated represent the great majority of Samis. The two groups who tend to choose one of the identities-Sami or Swedish-represent less than one third when combined and are about equal in size. Those marginalised with weak ethnic identities represent 2%. Although all meet the self-identification criterion of being Sami, few meet each of some 'objective' criteria, e.g. being involved in reindeer herding, having Sami as the home language or having parents or grandparents with Sami as the home language. The main predictors of a stronger Sami identity are cultural symbolic behaviours and heredity. The main negative predictor of a stronger Swedish identity among Samis is the use of cultural symbolic behaviours, and the main positive predictor is a positive estimate on the Swedish public opinion's interest in Samis. The findings are discussed in relation to Sami debates on indigeneity.

AB  - Place attachment is frequently referred to as a complex and integrative phenomenon encompassing a wide range of concepts. Place attachment is linked to the meanings created around recreation settings, yet knowledge is limited about the nature of place attachment and to what people are attached. This study examines the nature of place attachment among a sample of recreation homeowners in Southern Norway and to which attributes of the places they are attached. The results show that place attachment can be conceptualized on a general level while still containing subdimensions related to the place, the recreational home, and long-term connections to the area. A range of attributes including the natural and cultural environment, family and social activities, history, and traditions are all important in the development of affective bonds with the places in the study area. Identifying the subdimensions of place attachment enables a better prediction of the importance of different place attributes than the more holistic concept of place attachment.

AB  - In this paper we examine how animal and more-than-human agency matters in changing property relations and the related production of spatial (in)justice. We do this by examining conflicts arising between farmers, land owners and reindeer herders in the Norwegian outfields resulting from policy imperatives towards agricultural diversification. At the heart of the conflict we find issues of animal agency and mobility that the current regulatory system negotiating the interests of different rightsholders struggles to comprehend or deal with. We propose Haraway's concept of response-ability as one way in which more-than-human agency could be made more visible, and therefore better accounted for, in the unsettling and resettling of property relations and the law-space nexus generally. It allows us to interrogate more precisely on multiple levels of spatial and temporal production the responses available to human and nonhuman actors in various assemblages of property. Different rightsholders can have different capacities to respond when property assemblages are stabilised and destabilised. We also call for more attention to be paid to property and broader legal geographies and spatial justice in the current 'animal' and posthuman turn in social science.

AB  - A palaeoecological study was conducted close to the forest limit in the northern Scandinavian mountain range. The aim was to elucidate the degree to which human impact has affected the vegetation at Hiednikvalta, a Stallo settlement site. Stallo settlements consist of round hut foundations that have a hearth in the middle and are surrounded by a low turf wall. They were probably established by Sami people using the mountain areas for hunting and/or reindeer herding. In order to separate the effects of humans and climate on the vegetation, a reference area approach was adopted, i.e. the vegetation development at the Stallo settlement site Hiednikvalta was compared with the vegetation development in a forested reference area AvvuhatjAyenhkkAyen, at the same altitude as Hiednikvalta but with no archaeological remains of settlements. Peat stratigraphies were retrieved at the two sites and pollen analysis, loss-on-ignition (LOI), pollen accumulation rates (PAR), macrofossil analysis and Betula pollen size statistics were all examined. The results indicate that Hiednikvalta was forested with Betula trees prior to the Stallo settlement period, which occurred between the eighth and thirteenth centuries. Human activities resulted in a decrease in tree cover at the site, as found in a previous study at Adamvalta, another Stallo settlement site in the region. However, the magnitude of vegetation change, and the post-Stallo vegetation development differed between the two areas, suggesting that site-specific factors are important. The use of reference areas in palynological studies is also discussed.

AB  - Abundant large herbivores can strongly alter vegetation composition, shifting the ecosystem into a lasting state of changed productivity. Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway, possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world. The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators, large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem productivity in high-density districts.

AB  - The arctic forest-tundra ecotone (FTE) represents a major transition zone between contrasting ecosystems, which can be strongly affected by climatic and biotic factors. Expected northward expansion and encroachment on arctic tundra in response to climate warming may be counteracted by natural and anthropogenic processes such as defoliating insect outbreaks and grazing/browsing regimes. Such natural and anthropogenic changes in land cover can substantially affect FTE dynamics, alter ground albedo (index of the amount of solar energy reflected back into the atmosphere) and provide important feedbacks into the climate system. We took advantage of a naturally occurring contrast between reindeer grazing regimes in a border region between northern Finland and Norway which was recently defoliated by an outbreak of the geometrid moth. We examined ecosystem-wide contrasts between potentially year-round (but mainly summer) grazed (YRG) regions in Finland and mainly winter grazed (WG) regions in Norway. We also used a remotely sensed vegetation index and albedo to quantify effects on local energy balance and potential climate feedbacks. Although differences in soil characteristics and ground vegetation cover were small, we found dramatic differences in the tree layer component of the ecosystem. Regeneration of mountain birch stands appears to have been severely hampered in the YRG regime, by limiting regeneration from basal shoots and reestablishment of individual trees from saplings. This has led to a more open forest structure and a significant 5% increase in spring albedo in the summer grazed compared to the winter grazed regions. This supports recent suggestions that ecosystem processes in the Arctic can significantly influence the climate system, and that such processes must be taken into account when developing climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies.

AB  - We studied reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) distribution in relation to possible travel barriers (roads and power lines) in south-central Norway, 1997-2000, using lichen biomass as an indicator of reindeer use. We recorded lichen cover on both sides of potential barriers within comparable habitat in 42 sites for 3 different reindeer herds. We used cover-biomass regressions to assess the relationship between lichen cover and biomass. In 2 of the regions, lichen biomass was 5.3 times and 2.8 times higher in areas isolated by 2 parallel power lines and an adjacent winter-closed road compared to biomass on the other side of the potential barrier. In a third region, lichen biomass did not vary significantly between areas on either side of a single "inter-closed road. Lichen biomass data suggested that wild reindeer used both sides of a closed road in winter, whereas 2 parallel power lines and a winter-closed road in combination reduced reindeer migration and resulted in very different grazing pressures on either side of the power lines, even 30 years after the power lines were constructed. Construction of power lines, and particularly parallel power lines, should thus be avoided in wild reindeer habitat. Fragmentation of wild reindeer ranges in Norway results in a substantial reduction in available ranges and traditional migration routes between important seasonal ranges, with a likely overall reduction in carrying capacity.

AB  - Hydropower has been core in the nation-building process of several countries. This includes Sweden in which it currently supplies around 50% of the electricity and particularly Norway where almost all electricity is generated from hydropower. In these countries, as well as many others, the provision of hydroelectricity enabled urban and rural development, industrialization and other core value-added activities. However, it was realized with significant environmental costs, particularly at the local level. Traditionally, there has been a divide in perceptions on hydropower production, in which stakeholders tend to box it either as an environmental hazard or as a socio-economic benefit. During the last century, these diverging perspectives have influenced political and regulatory approaches as well as the perceived role of hydropower at large. Different attempts to bridge this divide have been made. This is not least true in the present day, considering the role of hydropower as a low-carbon solution, and a balancing source to counter increased intermittency from new renewables into the energy system. These features of contributing to the global good of mitigating climate change need to be assessed against the potential negative environmental consequences on biological diversity, outdoor recreation and landscape perceptions at large. These concerns triggered social mobilization and even became instrumental in establishing environmental NGOs with the core focus of fighting hydropower projects. Contrasting and often conflicting opinions are still prevailing, as exemplified with the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, there are current signs and new knowledge available suggesting that we are moving into a new era of hydropower governance. A potential reconciliation of contrasting perceptions is pending, but there is strong inertia to change. We argue that the understanding of past political modes and regulatory approaches are essential to develop more sustainable hydropower governance systems fit for future societal and environmental needs. We currently have the benefit of drawing on lessons learned. This provides an opportunity to shape new governance systems that are more balanced in a way not experienced before.

TI  - Effects of livelihood transformation on older persons in the Nordic Arctic: a gender-based analysis
T2  - POLAR RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - This paper addresses the transformation that has occurred in livelihoods in the Nordic Arctic, showing how it affects gender equality among the region's older people. The region's population includes the Sami, an indigenous people, who have traditionally relied for their livelihood on activities such as reindeer herding, making handicrafts, farming, fishing, hunting, trapping and gathering. In recent years these have faced enormous challenges because of the rapid transformation of the region in the wake of climate change and globalisation. Overall, these and other processes have precipitated socio-economic, cultural, environmental and infrastructural changes that are transforming the local economies and severely impacting older people in particular. The main research question examined in this article is whether gender inequality has arisen among older people because of the ongoing transformation of livelihoods. To this end, the paper provides an empirical analysis based on experiences gathered from field studies conducted by the author in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. The research also presents the experiences of older persons in light of the standard set by General Recommendation 27 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which oversees the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Recommendation sets out the right of older women to equality and nondiscrimination. The findings of the present research contribute to filling a gap in the literature on the topic.

AB  - Knowledge about the number of reproductive females is important for monitoring population dynamics, and can be critical for managing human-wildlife conflicts. For wolverines Gulo gulo, counts of reproductive females is the basis for estimates of population size in Scandinavia, as well as a key measure for compensation payments to Sami reindeer-herders in Sweden. However, documenting wolverine reproductive events in the field is challenging and requires knowledge of female denning behaviour. Furthermore, females may shift den sites, presenting difficulties in determining whether two den sites belong to the same or two neighbouring females. In this study, we used data from 18 GPS-collared wolverine females, monitored intensively during the denning season (15 February-31 May) in 2004-2014, to provide baseline information on denning behaviour. We documented reproductive events in 32 of 54 potential denning seasons, and identified a total of 245 den sites. Females used 8.8 +/- 8.5 (mean +/- SD) den sites per denning season (median = 6, range: 1-28). The number of den site shifts, the distance between subsequent den sites, and the time and distance females spent away from a den site increased during the denning season; while distances between neighbouring females' den sites remained constant. From late April, the distance between consecutive den sites used by the same female overlapped with distances between neighbouring females' den sites, resulting in increased uncertainty regarding whether two den sites belonged to one or two females. Using Bayesian modelling we calculated probabilities that two den sites belonged to the same female, or neighbouring females, conditional on the time of season and the distance between den sites. These findings will allow the monitoring program to adapt its methods for determining if multiple den sites belong to one or two reproductive events, using seasonally-dynamic threshold based on an understanding of wolverine denning behaviour.

AB  - In Gausdal, a mountainous community in southern Norway, a conflict involving dogsledding has dominated local politics during the past two decades. In order to understand local protests against this activity, in this article we apply discourse analysis within the evolving approach of political ecology. In this way, we also aim at contributing to the emerging trend of bringing political ecology "home". To many people, dogsledding appears as an environmentally friendly outdoor recreation activity as well as a type of adventure tourism that may provide new income opportunities to marginal agricultural communities. Hence, at a first glance, the protests against this activity may be puzzling. Looking for explanations for these protests, this empirical study demonstrates how the opposition to dogsledding may be understood as grounded in four elements of a narrative: (1) environmental values are threatened; (2) traditional economic activities are threatened; (3) outsiders take over the mountain; and (4) local people are powerless. Furthermore, we argue that the narrative is part of what we see as a broader Norwegian "rural traditionalist discourse". This discourse is related to a continued marginalization of rural communities caused by increasing pressure on agriculture to improve its efficiency as well as an "environmentalization" of rural affairs. Thus, the empirical study shows how opposition to dogsledding in a local community is articulated as a narrative that fits into a more general pattern of opposition to rural modernization in Norway as well as internationally.

AB  - Social innovation literature focuses commonly on roles of cooperation in addressing co-evolution of civil society initiatives and state-based governance toward sustainable solutions. However, roles of conflicts in driving social change are scarcely addressed in social innovation literature. We elaborated a concept of bottom-linked environmental governance, which can take place either via collaboration, or by conflict, and which can progress toward socio-political innovations. We show this progression by examining two longitudinal cases on forest controversies in Northern Finland. These are the cases of Inari and Muonio. They are characterized by dynamic processes of conflicts and collaboration between state-based organizations (e.g., Finnish forestry enterprise of Metsahallitus), civil society actors (e.g., reindeer herders, nature-based tourism entrepreneurs and environmental nongovernmental organizations). We conducted a qualitative deductive-inductive content analysis on the study cases and uncovered a set of "going out to get in" strategies by civil society actors, emerging from frustration on state-based participatory processes, and consisting of open disputes and pressure strategies outside the participatory processes to gain a seat and power at negotiation tables. Metsahallitus often responded by seeking to maintain its control over forest decisions. The interplay between these strategies led to continuous open disputes and finally to socio-political innovations (e.g., comanagement arrangement). The findings lead us to discuss reasons for prolonged disputes, the question of whether sociopolitical innovations can benefit all, considerations on power relations, strategies, and counter responses, all being relevant more broadly, for both, social innovation research and decision-making enabling socio-political innovations.

AB  - The global decline of children's independent mobility is well documented. Whilst the Nordic countries are no exception, a previous study discovered high levels of independent mobility in a suburban community in the south of Sweden (Johansson, M., A. Raustorp, F. Martensson, C. Boldemann, C. Sternudd, and M. Kylin. 2011. "Attitudal Antecedents of Children's Sustainable Everyday Mobility."Transport and Health Issues: Studies on Mobility and Transport Research3: 55-68). The current study investigates the everyday outdoor lives of children in this community to shed light on the mechanisms contributing to the children's independent mobility. Sixteen children aged 10-11 years old participated in place mapping and child-led walks. The results describe how their independent mobility grows from their joint commitment to play and socialise in a collective process that builds on their experiences of the local environment to form a shared patchwork of people, places and practices that meets their mutual needs. In light of plans for new development in the area, relational arrangements supporting children's agency are uncovered and independent mobility is confirmed as an important indicator of child-friendliness in planning.

AB  - Surfers often see themselves as "green". In this study we examine Norwegian surfers' attitudes and actions towards the environment. The article is based on a questionnaire (n = 251) and six qualitative interviews. The results show that most surfers see themselves as environmentally conscious. Oppositely, the data also show that they also buy a lot of surf-related apparel and equipment and travel a lot, and thereby contribute with a lot of CO2-emissions. In the article we investigate the apparent attitude-action gap amongst surfers. Does the gap give rise to emotional conflicts? And, if so, to what degree and how do they cope with it. In the article we start out by analysing such potential conflicts by using the concept cognitive dissonance. Further, we analyse the phenomena from a cultural, Bourdieusian perspective where values within the surf-field is highlighted. On the one hand, surf culture highly values connexion to nature and "green" thinking, on the other hand it also values and gives recognition to surfers that travels to and explore exotic destinations. Hence, values within surf culture leads surfers to conflicting actions. We end the article by discussing if these conflicts could be framed as cultural dissonance.

AB  - Rapid and interacting change poses an increasing threat to livelihoods and food production, and pastoralists in Nordland, northern Norway, are at a crossroads both economically and culturally. Some of these changes are localized and pertain to changing weather and grazing conditions caused by climate change and land fragmentation. Others, driven by national management policies and governance specifically related to predators, are poorly adjusted for the different and localized contexts. The pastoralists are inherently adaptive and have a long history of responding well to variable changing conditions. This is now changing with the continued increasing pressures from many directions. The central government systematically ignores pastoralists' traditional knowledge and enforces narrow sector policies to be implemented at regional and local levels. We address the effect of how institutional, physical, and societal constraints challenge pastoralists' prospects for sustainable adaptation. Our results show how pastoralists' livelihoods become compromised and potentially threatened because they are forced to respond in ways that they know are counterproductive in the long run. Adaptation outcomes are affected by different approaches and epistemologies that are situated across scale and context in terms of regional and national regulations versus local empirical reality among the pastoral communities. This study concludes that radical change is needed toward a more holistic governance in which multiple knowledge systems are integrated to ensure sustainable adaptation at all levels. This study is based on extensive and long-term fieldwork among reindeer herders and sheep farmers in Nordland, through a collaborative process of knowledge coproduction.

T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY

KW  - COMMUNITIES
AB  - The development of new mines forefronts the contested nature of sustainable development. Various competing pathways of sustainability underlie mining-related conflicts, often reaching beyond the local scale of contested locations. While powerful actors tend to 'close down' around particular pathways, 'opening-up' through the consideration of multiple pathways might be necessary for addressing complex situations and conflicts. Whether closing-down or opening-up occurs depends on governance structures and actors' interventions, but little is known of the dynamics involved. This paper develops understudied spatial dimensions of protest by clarifying how political opportunity structures may play out differently at different scales and in consequence impact scalar strategies of both social movements and state actors. The study comparatively analyses three mine development processes in Arctic, peripheral Sweden facing socioeconomic challenges and where mining threatens indigenous reindeer husbandry. Formal interactions are mapped by data from administrative records, while informal strategies and un-derlying frames are assessed through interviews and focus groups. The study shows that when there is a multiplicity of government authorities and influential mining-sceptical allies at different scales, some subnational units 'open-up' in response to mining-sceptical actions. Such 'opening-up' may influence policy decisions at higher scales, even the international. Local participation therefore constitutes a way to challenge the scalar hierarchy of the state and promote a broader and more nuanced range of pathways to sustainability. As 'opening-up' is not legally required, the results between the different cases differed, and where the opportunity structures were 'closed' mining-sceptics turned to confrontation and litigation.

AB  - We studied interannual variability and changes over time in selected climate indices in the reindeer management area (RMA) in northern Finland. We present together the knowledge possessed by reindeer herders with information from meteorological measurements over three decades. The practitioner knowledge was gathered via a survey questionnaire addressing herder observations of long-term changes (approximately during the past 30 years) in climatic conditions and their impacts on herding during the four seasons. A set of temperature-, precipitation- and snow-related indices relevant for herding within the RMA was derived from spatially interpolated daily meteorological data (1981-2010). Climatic changes detected based on the measurement data were mainly consistent with earlier studies, and practitioner knowledge was generally in line with the meteorological data. The herders had experienced the largest number of changes during the winter, and the smallest number of changes during the summer. The herders reported various impacts of changing seasonal weather on reindeer condition and behavior, and on herding practices. Adaptation to the changing conditions requires adoption of various coping strategies by the herders in their everyday work, continuous development of professional techniques and practices, as well as support received from the governance of reindeer management. We conclude that holistic understanding of the impacts of climate change and adaptation to changes in the future requires simultaneous analyses of data from different sources, more research co-defined with local practitioners, and co-planned governance solutions. The approach presented in this work can ease the dialogue between the local practitioners, researchers and policy makers. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ever since the present phase of wolf Canis lupus population growth began in southern Scandinavia in 1983 there has been controversy surrounding their origins. Genetical analyses have clarified that the wolves originate from the Finnish-Russian populations, but the debate continues about how they came to be in southern Scandinavia, with many wolf-opponents claiming they have been released in a clandestine action. By comparing the geography of Scandinavia to known wolf dispersal behaviour our analysis focuses on whether it is possible for wolves to have recolonised southern Scandinavia without human assistance. From 298 published dispersal distances for North American wolves, 10 were over 500 km, with the longest being 886 kin in a straight line. When also including data on actual distance moved, several wolves have been recorded to travel more than 4,000 km, often within only a few months. However, the published data are biased towards short-distance movements. Any wolves travelling from the Finnish-Russian border to the site of the 1983 reproduction would have to have travelled > 1,000 km, with potential routes being overland, or over the ice covered Baltic Sea during winter. From their present distribution, wolves have shown a clear ability to cross areas of sea-ice of up to 70 km. Therefore, it is possible for wolves to have colonised south Scandinavia through natural dispersal, although it requires movements at the extreme edge of what has been documented. As wolves expand in both southern Scandinavia and Finland, the distance between the populations will decrease, although contact will require passing through 500 kin of the conflict-full reindeer-herding areas or crossing of the Baltic Ice.

AB  - In search for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport, insights into the characteristics of all sorts of trips and specifically trips by car are needed. This paper focuses on everyday leisure trips for social and recreational purposes. Travel behaviour for these purposes is analysed considering individual and household factors as well as properties of the trip, based on Swedish national travel survey data. The analysis reveals that everyday leisure trips are often of joint character and that the average distance travelled per person and day increases with, for example, income, cohabitation, children in the household and residence in rural areas. The result also shows that the studied characteristics vary between studied trip purposes, influencing the sustainability potential of a reduction in car use and suggested measures. For instance, the largest share of passenger mileage comes from social trips, whereas trips for exercise and outdoor life have the largest share of car trips below 5 km. Several characteristics indicate difficulties in transferring trips by car to, for example, bicycle or public transport due to convenience, economy, start times, company etc. The study indicates that there is a need to take a broader view of the effective potential.

AB  - Tourism industry has developed into major economy that utilises the natural resources in western Lapland, Finland. Due to its huge growth, the question of sustainability is increasingly essential. This article focuses on social sustainability from the viewpoint of the local inhabitants at the tourist destinations of Yllas and Levi. These resorts have grown since 1970s in the surroundings of the old villages of Yllasjarvi, Akaslompolo and Sirkka. The study was conducted through telephone interviews. A total of 59 people from all three villages were interviewed and asked about social sustainability issues. Overall, the people were satisfied with the present situation but they were worried about excessively rapid growth in the future. The finds were similar to the results of a study in the early 1990s. One of the key notions was that Yllasjarvi seemed to differ from Akaslompolo and Sirkka. The people in Yllasjarvi thought that they as villagers and individuals had had more influence on the development of tourism than the people in other studied villages had had. In Akaslompolo, people considered non-local entrepreneurs as the primus motor in tourism development, and they more often reported contradictions between tourism and reindeer herding. The villagers in Sirkka at Levi most often felt that they had no real impact on the development of tourism. One important issue with respect to social sustainability was that local people felt they had the opportunity to affect the physical and cultural environment they lived in; the actions of local outsiders easily created contradictions and conflicts that might harm economical development. The fair allocation of the costs and benefits of tourism industry was also key issue for social sustainability.

AB  - Mesocarnivores increase in number and geographic range in human-disturbed ecosystems with cascading negative impact on biodiversity. To mitigate such impacts, it is essential to identify the proximate causes of such mesocarnivore releases. Here, we assess to what extent increased partial migration in semi-domesticated tundra reindeer induce a response in boreal and arctic mesocarnivores. We used a large-scale and multiyear quasi-experimental study design with camera traps deployed on coastal tundra peninsulas in northern Norway to estimate area occupancy of the whole carnivore community. These peninsulas represent summer pastures for separate semi-domestic reindeer herds that, owing to different degrees of partial migration, now display spatially and temporally variable densities of year-round resident reindeer. We estimated resident reindeer density by means of aerial surveys. Area occupancy of all the recorded carnivore species increased strongly when resident reindeer densities exceeded 15deerkm(-2). Most of the increasing carnivore species were typical boreal forest species, implying range expansions into tundra when provided with stable food resources (prey and carrion) in terms of resident reindeer.Synthesis and applications. We found that boreal mesocarnivores, known to negatively impact the productivity of reindeer and arctic wildlife of conservation concern, steeply increased in tundra areas with many year-round resident reindeer due to increased partial migration. To avoid such negative impacts, actions should be taken to minimize residency in tundra reindeer.

AB  - To meet the expanding land use required for wind energy development, a better understanding of the effects on terrestrial animals' responses to such development is required. Using GPS-data from 50 freely ranging female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Mala reindeer herding community, Sweden, we determined reindeer calving sites and estimated reindeer habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSF). RSFs were estimated at both second- (selection of home range) and third-order (selection within home range) scale in relation to environmental variables, wind farm (WF) development phase (before construction, construction, and operation), distance to the WFs and at the second-order scale whether the wind turbines were in or out of sight of the reindeer. We found that the distance between reindeer calving site and WFs increased during the operation phase, compared to before construction. At both scales of selection, we found a significant decrease in habitat selection of areas in proximity of the WFs, in the same comparison. The results also revealed a shift in home range selection away from habitats where wind turbines became visible toward habitats where the wind turbines were obscured by topography (increase in use by 79% at 5km). We interpret the reindeer shift in home range selection as an effect of the wind turbines per se. Using topography and land cover information together with the positions of wind turbines could therefore help identify sensitive habitats for reindeer and improve the planning and placement of WFs. In addition, we found that operation phase of these WFs had a stronger adverse impact on reindeer habitat selection than the construction phase. Thus, the continuous running of the wind turbines making a sound both day and night seemed to have disturbed the reindeer more than the sudden sounds and increased human activity during construction work.

AB  - Conserving large carnivores in multi-use landscape is a global challenge. In northern Norway the presence of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) conflicts greatly with the current ways of keeping free-grazing, unguarded livestock in large carnivore habitat. In contrast to most other places in Europe, livestock (sheep Ovis aries, reindeer Rangifer tarandus) are the only ungulate prey available for lynx in this area. The relative preference by lynx for these two domestic species will strongly influence depredation pressure for the respective species. We examined predation patterns on domestic sheep in summer from 17 GPS-collared lynx that had access to both free ranging sheep and reindeer. During 1115 lynx monitoring days, we documented 47 sheep and 274 reindeer killed by lynx. Most lynx individuals selected reindeer over sheep and the probability for a kill to be a sheep increased at low reindeer densities combined with high sheep densities. Kill rates on sheep were several times lower than for reindeer and were not related to density of livestock. General avoidance and low kill rates on sheep by most lynx generated low predation pressure on sheep within the reindeer husbandry, similar to what has been observed in areas of high roe deer densities. However, even a small shift of herd location within the designated summer grazing areas for reindeer could potentially cause a significant increase in depredation on sheep locally. This is one of several studies demonstrating that the density of alternative prey can modulate kill rates on livestock, which is important to include in spatially explicit risk models of large carnivore depredation on livestock.

AB  - Intensive forestry practices, defined as the additional removal of tree tops, branches, and sometimes stumps, have helped nations meet renewable energy goals, but can also deplete long-term base cation (i.e. Ca, Mg, and K) pools in forest mineral soils. Decreasing pools of base cations (BC) are of great concern in forest areas that became acidified during the 1970s and 1980s and have recently started to recover because many soils do not contain large reserves of available BCs and are therefore particularly sensitive to further BC loss and the threat of re-acidification. This project combined field data on tree growth and a database of BC concentrations in tree tissue component types (i.e. stem wood, bark, foliage, branches, stumps, and roots) compiled from the literature to simulate tree growth over 150 years and investigate the sustainability of BC removals from forests resulting from different harvest strategies and under different management scenarios. Our simulation results indicated that BC removals were greatest under the maximum tree growth management scenario, being roughly 50-100% greater than the business as usual, nature conservation, or reindeer husbandry scenarios. Additionally, removal of tree tops, branches, and stumps consistently resulted in removal rates of Ca, Mg, and K 3-4 times greater than conventional stem-only harvests. Intensified forestry practices may result in large decreases in available BC pools, however it is difficult to assess the potential sustainability of estimated BC removal rates because uncertainty surrounding current weathering estimates to compensate for BC removals is large and does not provide sufficient precision for robust comparisons of forestry practices. In order to help decision makers set effective policy, ensuring the long-term health and production of forest soils, we need improved accuracy of weathering estimates and a better understanding at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to forest management.

AB  - Over the last decade, we have seen a massive increase in the construction of wind farms in northern Fennoscandia. Wind farms comprising hundreds of wind turbines are being built, with little knowledge of the possible cumulative adverse effects on the habitat use and migration of semi-domesticated free-ranging reindeer.
   We assessed how reindeer responded to wind farm construction in an already fragmented landscape, with specific reference to the effects on use of movement corridors and reindeer habitat selection.
   We used GPS-data from reindeer during calving and post-calving in the MalAyen reindeer herding community in Sweden. We analysed data from the pre-development years compared to the construction years of two relatively small wind farms.
   During construction of the wind farms, use of original migration routes and movement corridors within 2 km of development declined by 76 %. This decline in use corresponded to an increase in activity of the reindeer measured by increased step lengths within 0-5 km. The step length was highest nearest the development and declining with distance, as animals moved towards migration corridors and turned around or were observed in holding patterns while not crossing. During construction, reindeer avoided the wind farms at both regional and landscape scale of selection.
   The combined construction activities associated with even a few wind turbines combined with power lines and roads in or close to central movement corridors caused a reduction in the use of such corridors and grazing habitat and increased the fragmentation of the reindeer calving ranges.

AB  - Wildlife may adapt activity patterns to daily and seasonal variations in environmental factors and human activity. At the daily scale, diurnal or nocturnal activity can be a response to variations in food availability and/or human avoidance. At the seasonal scale, variation in prey vulnerability underlies the influence of predators on prey population dynamics, which is of management concern when predation affects domestic species. We analyzed the movement patterns of 133 GPS-collared brown bears in three study areas in Sweden in spring, when bears prey on the calves of domestic reindeer and moose, and in summer-early fall, when bears rely mostly on berries, in three areas with a gradient of human disturbance. In spring, the bears' daily movement patterns and time of predation on ungulates overlapped. In summer-early fall, when bears are hyperphagic to store fat for hibernation and reproduction, variation in the degree of nocturnal behavior among study areas likely reflected behavioral adjustments to reduce the risk of encountering people. Flexibility in daily movement patterns by large carnivores may help them survive in human-dominated landscapes, but behavioral changes may also reflect environmental degradation, for example human disturbance influencing foraging opportunities. Diurnal human activity disturbs the carnivores, but that does not hinder depredation on reindeer, because it occurs mostly at night. Thus, ideally carnivores and reindeer should be separated spatially to reduce depredations. A zoning system prioritizing carnivore conservation and reindeer herding in different areas might help reduce a long-lasting conflict.

AB  - Almost all commercial forests of Finland are simultaneously used for timber production, outdoor recreation and biodiversity maintenance. For the past 60 years, the official line of silviculture has been even-aged management. However, uneven-aged management and other forms of continuous cover forestry are gradually gaining popularity and also official acceptance. This study analyzed variable density thinning (VDT) in the context of uneven-aged management of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.Karsten) stands. The aim was to find economically profitable management systems, which would result in forests that are good for recreation and biodiversity maintenance. The stand compartment was divided into cutting segments and only one segment was harvested at a time. When economic profitability was maximized as the sole management objective, 15-year cutting cycle with uniform thinning (UT) was the optimal management system. All trees larger than 19 cm in diameter at breast height (all saw log-sized trees) were removed in the cutting. When a continuous presence of large trees was required, VDT was clearly more profitable than UT. In VDT, all large trees were removed from the thinned places but there were large trees in the segments that will be cut in the next logging operation. The optimal cutting cycle (interval between successive cuttings in the same place) of VDT was 20-30 years when large trees were required in the post-cutting forest. Several combinations of the length of cutting cycle and number of cutting segments were nearly equally profitable. Profitable options were, for instance, to divide the stand into four cutting segments each cut at 20-year interval or three segments each cut at 30-year interval.

AB  - We explore from a time-use perspective how private use of computers and the Internet [information and communications technologies (ICTs)] is transforming everyday life. Data from the Swedish 2010-2011 Time-Use Survey reflect a situation in which Internet use has spread widely and become routine for many. Using covariate analysis, we analyse differences in general time use between four groups of ICT users ranging from non-users to heavy users. The theoretical departure point is a nuanced discussion of the time-displacement concept. Results indicate that private time spent using ICTs is associated primarily with individuals' available free time, that is, elastic relative to time for paid work (i.e. contracted time). Heavy ICT users spend more time on activities carried out alone, are more home centred, and less mobile. Heavy use is associated with somewhat less committed time spent, for example, on maintenance work or taking care of children. Regarding personal time, time for meals is negatively related to heavy use, while night-time sleep is unaffected. Concerning free time, heavy use takes time from sports and outdoor recreation, but has no effect on offline media use, entertainment and cultural activities, or reading. Heavy use does not affect time spent on social activities, for example, for social interaction with family and friends or time spent on voluntary associations. Observed differences become significant at certain thresholds of ICT-related time use, involving heavy users who spend one hour or more on computers and the Internet every day.

AB  - Southern Norway holds the last remaining population of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Roads, railroads, and power lines have fragmented the original population into 26 separate herds. The reindeer populations are regulated directly according to availability of winter forage. These winter ranges, generally at lower elevations, are however, often subjected to development. Effects of infrastructure and associated human activity on the distribution of wild reindeer during winter were investigated in the Nordfjella mountain region of western Norway. Systematic aerial surveys of the distribution of ca. 2500 reindeer were conducted during late winter 1986-1998. Areas within 2.5 km from power lines were used less than available in 6 of the 8 sampling years, and areas beyond this zone more than expected. Density of reindeer was 79% lower within 2.5 km from power lines compared with background areas, and increased with increasing distance from infrastructure for comparable habitat. Available forage in terms of lichen cover declined 15-30-fold with distance, and was lowest in the undisturbed areas with the highest density of grazing animals. Areas within 5 kni from resorts or from roads and power lines in combination were avoided in all years. Continued construction of roads, power lines and cabin resorts endanger these available winter ranges, and hence the long term survival of the population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - During the last 25 yr, Sami reindeer husbandry in parts of Finnmarksvidda in the Norwegian Arctic has been in a critical state because of overexploitation of lichen-dominated tundra, which serves as winter forage. To better understand the ecosystem's capabilities for recovery we investigated vegetation cover changes over a 7-yr period, starting in 1998, at 52 sites dispersed over a large area at Finnmarksvidda. Two types of plots were established: one fenced from reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period. Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083 +/- 0.011 per year in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time, fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition, lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz, shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were repairable.

AB  - Basal ice formation in the terrestrial snow cover is a common phenomenon in northern circumpolar areas, onehaving significant impacts on ecosystems, vegetation, animals and human activities. There is limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal occurrence of basal ice formation because of the sparse observation network and challenges involved in detecting formation events. We present a unique dataset on the annual extent of ice formation events in northern Finland between 1948 and 2016 based on reindeer herders' descriptions of the cold season in their management reports. In extreme years, basal ice can form over wide geographical extents. In approximately half of the herding districts studied, it occurred more frequently in the period 1983-2016 than in the period 1948-1982. Furthermore, five out of seven of the most extensive basal ice formation events (90th percentile) occurred between 1991 and 2016. Themost commonly reported processes related to ice formation were thaw or rain-on-snow events followed by freezing of the snow cover. Years with extensive basal ice formation were often characterized by above-average October-December air temperatures, air temperature variations around 0 degrees C and relatively high precipitation. However, basal ice did not occur during all warm and wet early winters, and formation events were generally weakly linked to the large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. Another risk factor for reindeer grazing associated with warm and rainy earlywinters is the growth of mycotoxin-producing molds below the snow. Approximately 24% of all reported mold formation events co-occurred with basal ice formation. The prevalence and frequency of basal ice formation events can be assessed based on our results. Ourwork contributes to understanding long-term fluctuations and changes in snow and ice conditions and the impacts of this variability in circumpolar areas.

AB  - The aim of the study is to examine friluftsliv, which has been used as both a Norwegian and English term in the research literature, in relation to physical literacy (PL) in physical education (PE) pedagogies. The term friluftsliv is associated to outdoor recreation and it relates to moving and being moved in nature over a specified period of time, changing one's environment, having experiences of nature and respect for the nature and its' sustainable future. The PL discourse in the research literature does not draw on many perspectives on nature and on education for an environmentally sustainable future, especially in our present times of climate change. The research questions is: How can friluftsliv broaden the understanding of PL in PE pedagogies and include a friluftsliv- and nature perspective? We argue that friluftsliv adds an interesting nature element in the concept of PL, and we propose the concept of 'friluftsliv literacy' to broaden the understanding of PL. We exemplify and elaborate on 'friluftsliv literacy' through an analysis of data from a study of experiences of friluftsliv trips taken by students in a upper secondary school that offers the three-year education program in friluftsliv in Norway. A key point of the analysis is that key aspects of 'friluftsliv literacy', which are outlined in the study, both support and refresh the concept of PL, which especially draws on existential and phenomenological perspectives. At the same time, 'friluftsliv literacy' will problematize the concept of PL, as the PL discourse should relate more to education for an environmental sustainable future and for protection of life on earth both locally and globally.

AB  - Agroforestry has long traditions in Finland in form of wood pastures and reindeer herding. However latter is nowadays the only form of agroforestry which is widely practiced in northern parts of Finland as area coverage of wood pastures has declined steeply form the beginning of 1950's. Finland has vast resources of forest, the total forest coverage being 71,6 % of Finland's total land area. This number is one of the highest in the world. However, new innovative and active agroforestry measures distinctive to the environment and culture has not been developed in the past though forests hold several, readily available Non-wood Forest Products (NWFP's). Forests have mainly been seen as a source of timber and pulp and the awareness of multiple uses of forest has not been come to prominence until 1990's.
   Berries and mushrooms are Finland's most important NWFPs. They are collected from the wild for incomes and recreation. The yearly value of forest berry-and mushroom harvests varies from 4 to 25 million (sic) and from 300 000 to 4 million (sic), respectively. Berry-and mushroom harvests vary greatly between years, depending on weather conditions affecting the flowering, pollination and fruiting body formation. As wild berries and mushrooms are the most important NWFP's in Finland, MTT Agrifood Finland (as from 1.1.2015 Natural Resources Institute Finland - Luke) started to develop innovative, active agroforestry methods for high-yielding and constant berry and mushroom production. Two projects were launched; LUSTI in 2010 and RahaRaaseikko in 2012. Both of them were funded by the EU Rural Development Programme for Mainland Finland 2007-2013.
   Project LUSTI - Securing the Availability of Nature Derived Berries with Cultivation Practices, aimed to test the feasibility of several agroforestry - based cultivation practices to ensure higher and more stable wild berry harvests. Project RahaRaaseikko aimed to develop mushroom production methods in low productive forests. Both of these projects aim to shape new cultural identity for Finnish agroforestry. These projects are presented briefly in this article.

AB  - Understanding of how a large landscape or network of conservation areas and habitats of red-listed species change in time is an important topic when addressing the temporal interplay between protected areas and matrix. We developed models of habitat suitability indices (HSI) for saproxylic red-listed invertebrate and fungal species, accounting for roughly 70% of all red-listed boreal forest species of the study area in eastern Finland. By using a forestry planning program that incorporates various optimisation methods we analysed trade-offs between timber production and amount of habitats of saproxylic red-listed species within a 60-year period. We also produced production possibility frontiers that show how to increase quality of the matrix with least costs. Moreover, we analysed how habitat suitability criteria used in optimisations affect the area of different habitat quality classes.
   Our analysis shows that by adopting HSI models in long-term matrix management, it is possible to increase habitats for several red-listed species without substantial losses in timber production. The increase in habitat area is achieved mainly by decreasing the area that is thinned compared to intensive timber production plan. In the long term, this seems to be a novel cost-effective method to increase the quality of the matrix for red-listed saproxylic species. However, the selected optimisation method and the criteria or specification of the management objective for red-listed forest species have a strong effect on results when HSI models are used in conservation planning. Therefore any practical application must be performed with great care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human activity is accelerating biodiversity loss despite international commitments to prevent extinction and habitat degradation. To bend the curve, international goals must be translated into national targets and actions. Tools to do this are highly needed, but scarce. We present a first attempt to operationalize national Red Lists by using the quantitative criteria of risk assessment as quantifiable objectives in a Red to Green framework. The framework allows for a systematic setting of conservation goals, with quantifiable conservation objectives, and identifying conservation actions to achieve these objectives. We developed an index of conservation outcome, modified from the Red List Index, to quantify the potential conservation outcomes of implementing suggested conservation actions. We tested the framework and index on 123 Red Listed species and habitats prioritized for conservation by the Norwegian government. The policy-defined goal was to downlist them by one Red List category by 2035. We identified land use change as the greatest threat. For 70% of species and 20% of habitats, knowledge was insufficient to recommend conservation actions. Further, due to unmanageable threats, alternative, lower-ambitioned goals were suggested for 30% of the species. Our case show that reaching national goals is difficult, but possible if main constraints are resolved. Through a systematic assessment of knowledge and conservation actions, the framework forms a solid foundation for developing national action plans for biodiversity conservation, allowing for prioritization and implementation of conservation actions and reporting on progress. This is an important first step to reach national targets defined from international goals.

AB  - Loss of biodiversity is a pressing global issue, hence it is vital to facilitate informed and effective conservation. As conservation mainly operates at the level of habitats, aiming for species of conservation interest, conservation and management require adequate ecological knowledge of prioritized species for the geographic and environmental setting considered.
   Our aim was to investigate if ecological documentation in national Red Lists could be combined and used to identify important forest habitats and ecological variables for red-listed forest species in Fennoscandia, and whether this knowledge could be arranged at different geographical scales and for various selections of species of conservation interest. We compiled the national Red Lists of Finland, Norway and Sweden and extracted ecological information for all red-listed forest species (n = 4830). We used a principal component analysis to investigate variation in distribution of species and their habitat associations and taxonomical groups, and to group species of similar associations. We further used the listed species in Sweden as an example, and compared the proportions of species associated to the ecological variables dead wood, living trees or merely the "forest floor and understory" a) at larger and smaller scale (Fennoscandia - county in Sweden), b) in regions with contrasting biomes (nemoral and boreal), and c) in two more limited selections of species of conservation interest; Fennoscandian and globally red-listed species also red-listed in Sweden.
   Ecological information could be extracted for 96% of the species, albeit with a low resolution; i.e. overall forest habitats, associated tree species, lifeforms and six other ecological variables selected based on their frequent appearance in the Red List documentation. Using this information, we identified five large-scale patterns for Fennoscandian red-listed species; the majority of red-listed species is associated with coniferous forest. The number of red-listed species associated with specific tree species was poorly correlated with the amount of each tree species in Fennoscandia. Dead wood was one of the most important habitat features in terms of number of associated red-listed species, and the proportion of species associated to dead wood was similar in coniferous, boreal and nemoral broad-leaved forests types.
   We demonstrate that ecological documentation in national Red Lists can be used to identify general ecological variables at varying geographical scales and for different selections of species, albeit not with sufficient resolution to provide detailed local conservation guidelines.

AB  - BackgroundGreen exercise (physical activity in presence of nature) has beneficial effects for health and wellbeing. Green exercise is a popular form of recreation in the Nordic countries, but participation is lower among the immigrant population from non-Western countries. However, no attention has been given to immigrants from the European Economic Area regarding this topic. Given the cultural and structural differences that surround green exercise in Italy and Norway, the case of the Italian immigrants in Norway is of interest to enrich our understanding of green exercise and its significance for health and wellbeing among immigrants in the Nordic countries.MethodsThis convergent mixed methods study investigated the pathways that link green exercise to health and wellbeing among Italian immigrants in Norway. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey (n = 321), which was oversampled to better reflect the sociodemographic profile of the reference population. Logistic regression was used to model the association of green exercise with self-rated health (SRH) or satisfaction with life (SWL) before and after controlling for selected confounders (age, gender, educational level, language proficiency, social support, and childhood experiences with green exercise). Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews (n = 14) and analysed thematically. Merging of the two strands was done using a simultaneous bidirectional approach.ResultsThe logistic regression found a significant bivariate association of green exercise with both SRH and SWL, though the association remained significant only for SWL after controlling for confounders. From the thematic analysis, three themes were identified: Green exercise opportunities contributing to overall satisfaction, Closeness to nature, and Embracing a new lifestyle. The integrated findings indicate that green exercise supported the immigrants' wellbeing, especially by providing stress relief, though socioeconomic status and acculturation may have a major impact on general health. Familiarity, appreciation of nature benefits, social support, and acculturation were identified as facilitating factors.ConclusionsThis study provides novel insights into how green exercise supports health, wellbeing, and inclusion among immigrants to the Nordic countries and emphasizes the importance of developing culturally adapted strategies to enhance this health-promoting activity among immigrant populations.

AB  - In the Latnjavagge drainage basin (9 km(2); 950 m - 1440 m a.s.l.; 68 degrees 20'N, 18 degrees 30'E), an arctic-oceanic periglacial environment in the mountain area of northernmost Swedish Lapland, present-day direct human impacts on mechanical denudation have been investigated. The Latnjavagge drainage basin is covered by snow for most of the year. The annual mean temperature is -2.3 degrees C (1993-2001) and the mean annual precipitation is 818 mm (1990-2001). Snow melt starts normally in the end of May. The area belongs to the mid-alpine zone with a continuous vegetation cover comprising dwarfshrub heaths and alpine meadows and bogs. At the slope systems, rockfalls, boulder falls, slushflows, avalanches, debris flows and slides, solifluction, creep processes, deflation and slope wash cause mechanical denudation. Most of the total annual sediment load in the streams and creeks is transported within a few days during snowmelt generated runoff peaks. Ice patches and fields, channel debris pavements mobilized during peak discharges and exposing fines, and material mobilized by slushflows are the main natural sources for solid load. Due to the very stable vegetation cover and closed rhizosphere in the area, larger rainfall events are of limited importance for suspended sediment transport. The intensities of mechanical denudation and fluvial sediment transport are very low. Direct human impacts in the area are (1) extensive reindeer husbandry, (2) hiking tourism and (3) field research (at the Latnjajaure Field Station LFS). Direct human impacts have the highest intensity injuly. The gentle, W-facing valley slope is much more affected by direct human impacts than other areas within the drainage basin. The importance of the vegetation cover for the stabilization of the slope systems is underlined. Local damages of the vegetation cover and local stress to the system due to direct human impacts cause locally significantly higher mechanical fluvial denudation. The areas showing a significant stress to the natural vegetation cover come to less than 5% of the total catchment area. Altogether, the present-day direct human impact on the natural mechanical denudation rate of the Latnjavagge drainage basin is small. The numbers of reindeers, tourists and scientists/students at LFS are in a scale that does not cause larger changes of the natural denudative geomorphological processes operating in this periglacial environment.

AB  - One of the largest threats to biodiversity is land use change and habitat loss. Hollow oaks (Quercus spp. L.) are well-defined patches that are hotspots for biodiversity and red-listed species, but they are often rare and fragmented in the landscape. We investigated the effect of patch size, habitat quality, and isolation on functional groups and red-listed saproxylic beetles in hollow oaks (n = 40) in Norway. The groups were defined by host tree association, trophic grouping, and red-listed status. Habitat quality, represented by tree form was most important in explaining species richness for most groups. Patch size, represented by circumference and amount of dead branches, was most important in explaining abundance. Isolation, that is single oaks compared with oaks in groups, had a negative effect on the abundance of beetles feeding both on wood and fungi (xylomycethopagous), as well as on species associated with broadleaved trees (oak semi-specialists), but did not affect species richness. This indicates that at this scale and in this landscape, isolated oaks are as species rich and valuable for conservation as other oaks, although some functional groups may be more vulnerable to isolation than others. The red-listed species only responded to patch size, indicating that oaks with large circumference and many dead branches are especially important for red-listed species and for conservation.

AB  - Outdoor microclimate is important to determine the quality of outdoor spaces. Swedish people cherish summer period and prefer more outdoor activities in summer because of long winter with harsh outdoor environments. People in urban areas use parks for recreation and outdoor activities frequently in summer. Under subarctic climate, limited studies have been performed to explore the effect of micro climate environments on usage of outdoor spaces such as parks. The study explored the relationship of microclimate environments, park use and human behavioral patterns in urban area of Umea, Sweden, which is under subarctic climate. Observations of naturally occurring behavior were recorded. Structured interviews, based on specially designed questionnaires, were performed during July to August in 2015. Measurements of objective parameters for microclimate environments, including air dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and globe temperature, were performed. Human subjective responses from the questionnaire survey were compared with objectively measured results. 49% of local persons still prefer higher solar radiation even under "slightly warm" Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV), which reflects their high expectation to solar radiation. Local persons in Umea, who expose themselves to a wider climate, are more adapted to subarctic climate than non-local persons.
   Practical implications: The pilot study demonstrated that wind attenuation together with strong sunshine can improve Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV), which could be realized by specially designed hump terrain for attenuating wind without shading effects. The results will be used for optimizing design of urban outdoor environments such as parks under subarctic or arctic climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is important that legislation on water quality issues of freshwaters is not in conflict with nature conservation purposes. So far, it is however unknown how the assessment of ecological status according to for example the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Community relates to the status of lakes according to the Habitat Directive (HD) or to national environmental objectives including, e.g., the protection of important wetland areas and red-listed species. We used lake macrophyte classification schemes of Norway, Sweden, and Finland and a total of 1,014 lakes to evaluate the possible conflict between these directives and national legislation. The classification schemes represent mainly trophic indices penalizing lakes with elevated phosphorous concentrations. In general, high ecological status according to the WFD did not mean high number of red-listed species or high status according to the HD or other national environmental objectives. In Sweden 78%, in Norway 47%, and in Finland 29% of lakes with red-listed species were classified as lakes of moderate or worse ecological status based on the macrophyte classification scheme. These lakes thus did not fulfill the demands of the WFD. Restoration of surface water toward fulfilling the demands requires in practice a reduction of the trophic status. This might potentially result in for example the loss of red-listed species. To avoid such potential conflicts, we primarily suggest revising the national quality assessment systems toward implicitly incorporating nature conservation aspects, e.g., the number of red-listed species in a multi-metric assessment system.

AB  - The recovery and conservation of large carnivores can negatively impact the economy of traditional pastoralist societies, including indigenous reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herding communities. Quantifying the magnitude of predation on livestock is critical to evaluating governmental carnivore compensation schemes. We collaborated with two Sami herding communities in northern Sweden (2010-2012) to examine brown bear (Ursus arctos) predation patterns on semi-domesticated reindeer and quantify the economic impact of bear predation. Predation patterns were estimated by following 21 GPS proximity-collared bears and similar to 2500 transmitter-collared female reindeer during calving season. We calculated economic impact by multiplying the monetary value of reindeer by the expected number lost to bears. On average, bears killed 10.2 [8.6, 11.5] calves per bear, accounting for 39-62% of all calf mortality, while few adult reindeer were killed. Bear kill rates increased with time spent in the calving area, and varied widely by individual and reproductive status, e.g., females with cubs-of-the-year did not kill calves. Kill intervals increased over the parturition season, and were larger for sub-adults than adults. The mean reindeer calf predation rate was 16-27%, which resulted in an annual loss between similar to(sic)50,000 and similar to(sic)62,000 per herding group. Current compensation schemes for herding communities in Sweden are calculated as a fixed rate based on herding community land-area. The herding groups in our study were reimbursed for similar to 2% of realized monetary loss. Compensation schemes based on herding community area, rather than realized predation patterns, may be less effective at mitigating the economic impact of living with large carnivores.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to describe consequences of climate change in the mountain region of southern Norway with respect to recently exposed finds of archaeological remains associated with reindeer hunting and trapping at and around ice patches in central southern Norway. In the early years of the twenty-first century, warm summers caused negative glacier mass balance and significant glacier retreat and melting of ice patches in central southern Norway. As a result, prehistoric remains lost and/or left by past reindeer hunters appeared at ice patches in mountain areas of southern Norway. In the warm summer and autumn of 2006 the number of artefact recoveries at ice patches increased significantly because of melting of snow and ice patches and more than 100 objects were recovered in the Oppland county alone. In 2009, detailed multidisciplinary investigations were carried out at the Juvfonne ice patch in Jotunheimen at an elevation of c. 1850 metres. A well-preserved Iron Age hunting station was discovered and in total c. 600 artefacts have been documented at the Juvfonne site alone. Most of the objects were recovered and brought to the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo for conservation, exhibition and storing. Thirteen so called 'scaring sticks' recovered from the recently exposed foreland of Juvfonne were radiocarbon dated, yielding ages that group in two separate time intervals, AD 246-534 and ad 804-898 (+/- 1 sigma). By putting the temporal distribution of the radiocarbon-dated artefacts into the context of late-Holocene glacier-size variations in the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen regions, we conclude that the most extensive reindeer hunting and trapping associated with snow/ice patches was related to periods with prevailing warm summers when the reindeer herds gathered on high-altitude, contracted glaciers and ice patches to avoid insect plagues. The 'freshness' of the fragile organic finds strongly indicates that at least some of the artefacts were rapidly covered by snow and ice and that they may have been more-or-less continuously covered by snow and ice since they were first buried.

AB  - The domestic cat (Felis catus) is among the most popular companion animals and most abundant carnivores globally. It is also a pet with an immense ecological footprint because even non-feral and food-subsidized cats can be prolific predators. Whereas knowledge about the spatial behavior of individual domestic cats is growing, we still know little about how a local population of free-ranging pet cats occupies the landscape. Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface-the "catscape"-that potential prey have to navigate. There were few gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 m to their owner's home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats. We discuss the catscape as a conceptual and quantitative tool for better understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of domestic cats.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) offer safe havens for threatened species, but their effectiveness is jeopar-dised due to climate change and habitat fragmentation in their surroundings. Species are forced into the unhospitable matrix in search of more favourable areas as climate conditions change, leading to negative effects on biodiversity. For red-listed forest species, the accelerating climate change can strengthen the negative effects of logging around PAs. In this work, we examine climate-change and land-use threats to biologically valuable PAs with red-listed species occur-rences in Finland. Where the highest combined threats occur, do they coincide with accumula-tions of red-listed species, and how much do they vary between different boreal zones? This provides important knowledge for conservation planning in a managed matrix amid climate change. We use three spatial scales (100 m, 1 km, 10 km) to explore where the effects of clear -cutting have been the most intense during this millennium: right outside the PA border, exposing PAs to local-scale edge effects, or at landscape scales disrupting species movements due to degraded connectivity and increased fragmentation. For each PA, we also quantify how the January mean temperature (TJan), growing degree days (GDD5) and water balance (WAB) con-ditions are predicted to change by the end of the century under the RCP4.5 scenario. Additionally, for these variables, we estimate the velocity of the changes within valuable PAs. The proportion of forests which underwent clear-cutting was the highest in the more productive southern boreal zone and at the landscape scale of 10 km around the PAs. The combined threats of land use and climate change were evident, as there were positive correlations between logging levels around PAs with red-listed species and both the velocity values of GDD5 and TJan in the PAs. TJan is changing particularly fast in the northern boreal zone, where the coldest current climate condi-tions are projected to disappear by the end of the century. GDD5 in turn is changing fastest in the topographically flat southern boreal zone. GDD5 and TJan had generally a positive relationship with the magnitude of clear-cuts in a 10 km buffer zone. However, the direction of this rela-tionship varied between the boreal zones. In climate-wise conservation planning for red-listed boreal forest species, multiple elements are needed. First and foremost, valuable sites for the red-listed species in the PA network should be identified and the climate change and land use -based threats to them measured. This information provides an elementary basis for additional threat analyses focusing on species habitat requirements and dispersal ecology. Together, this information can be used to assess the potential of different conservation measures to mitigate the combined climate-change and land-use risks, and ultimately to improve the conservation status of red-listed forest species.

AB  - Population size has increasingly been taken as the driver of past human environmental impact worldwide, and particularly in the Arctic. However, sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), pollen and archaeological data show that over the last 12,000 years, paleoeconomy and culture determined human impacts on the terrestrial ecology of Arctic Norway. The large Mortensnes site complex (Ceavccageadgi, 70 degrees N) has yielded the most comprehensive multiproxy record in the Arctic to date. The site saw occupation from the Pioneer period (c. 10,000 cal. years BP) with more intensive use from c. 4,200 to 2,000 cal. years BP and after 1,600 cal. years BP. Here, we combine on-site environmental archaeology with a near-site lake record of plant and animal sedaDNA. The rich animal sedaDNA data (42 taxa) and on-site faunal analyses reveal switches in human dietary composition from early-Holocene fish + marine mammals, to mixed marine + reindeer, then finally to marine + reindeer + domesticates (sheep, cattle, pigs), with highest reindeer concentrations in the last millennium. Archaeological evidence suggests these changes are not directly driven by climate or variation in population densities at the site or in the region, but rather are the result of changing socio-economic activities and culture, probably reflecting settlers' origins. This large settlement only had discernable effects on its hinterland in the last 3,600 years (grazing) and more markedly in the last 1,000 years through reindeer keeping/herding and, possibly domestic stock. Near-site sedaDNA can be linked to and validate the faunal record from archaeological excavations, demonstrating that environmental impacts can be assessed at a landscape scale.

AB  - National Red Lists are widely used prioritizing tools for nature conservation. However, status and trends of species vary with scale, and accounting for a larger spatial scale may provide complementary perspectives for nature conservation. We investigate effects of up-scaling and influence of wider-scale distribution patterns for composition of Red Lists. We collated nationally red-listed forest species in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and extracted "Candidates for a Fennoscandian Red List" (CFRL), defined as species red-listed where they appear in the region. For each country, we compared composition of organism groups and forest type associations of species that were national CFRL to the nationally red-listed species not CFRL. European distribution patterns were compared to investigate how broader-scale distribution is reflected in national Red Lists.
   Among the 4830 nationally red-listed forest species in Fennoscandia, 58% were CFRL. The fraction of species in the different forest type and species groups differed significantly between the two spatial scales for several groups, although the overall differences in composition were relatively small. Red-listed species had more confined distribution patterns, suggesting that many nationally red-listed species owe their status to being at the edge of their distribution range.
   An up-scaling had a large effect on which species designated to a Red List, but a relatively small impact on which organism groups or forest types that contained most red-listed species. A regional perspective generated by compilation of national Red Lists can give valuable complementary information on the status of species and effects of scale. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This study, was performed to obtain information on the presence and abundance of red-listed vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens of forests in an objective and systematic way, and on a large scale. Species were searched for in line transects in three areas in southern Sweden, representing a total of 1350 km(2). I investigated 135 ha of production forests and for comparison, 35 so-called "woodland kej, habitats" (WKHs) covering 63 ha. It is estimated that there are 70,000 WKHs in Sweden presumed to be important sites for red-listed species. I found 22% of the forest vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens on the national red list, indicating that most such species are very, rare. The red-listed bryophytes and lichens were considerably, more common than the vascular plants. Due to a relatively, high abundance of a few red-listed species, the average number of records for the three species groups together was 0.9-2.4/ha in the production forest. Extrapolated to the whole hemiboreal region of Sweden, there could be several million occurrences of red-listed plant species within the managed forests. The red-listed species were to a high degree associated with deciduous trees and dead wood and occurred mainly, in mature forests. Woodland kej, habitats had more red-listed species, more species in high categories of threat, and significantly, more records per hectare than production forests. Because WKHs constitute only, 1% of the productive forest land in Sweden, they, cannot alone safeguard the future of red-listed species. The great importance of managed forests, which make up more than 95% of the productive forest land in Sweden, must be acknowledged, Combined conservation planning is recommended, with attention being given to both WKHs and production forests.

AB  - The continuous decline of forest biodiversity highlights the importance of the development of cost-effective and ecologically sustainable land-use planning approaches. Spatial conservation prioritisation (SCP) can be regarded as a useful tool for this challenge. We produced high-resolution, national scale SCP analyses to identify unprotected forest areas that host valuable forest biodiversity. We used stand-based modelled dead wood potential (DWP) data as a primary surrogate for conservation value. In addition, data on forestry operations that have negative impacts on biodiversity, connectivity between forest areas, the observations of red-listed forest species, connectivity to forest habitats of special importance for biodiversity, and connectivity to permanent protected areas were included in the analyses. Analyses addressed the estimation of present value and that of future potential following increases in connectivity. The results show that there are high conservation priority forest areas all over Finland although their distribution is highly fragmented. Depending on the version of the analyses, the best 10% of the landscape contains from 49% to 88% of the conservation values, a significant portion of which lie outside the current protected area network. Consequently, as biodiversity continues to decline in Finland and as most of the Finnish forest area is under commercial management, the current protected area network cannot be expected to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. Therefore, these analyses provide much-needed information for decision-making. They are a pragmatic tool for the planning of forest conservation networks and commercial management of forests at regional and national scales.

AB  - Habitats of particular importance, as defined in the recent Forest Act of Finland, provide a new means to conserve forest biodiversity in managed forest landscapes. These "Forest Act habitats" should by definition contain populations of rare and red-listed species, but their species composition has not been studied. In this work, indicator and red-listed lichens were studied in private forests of southern Finland in three Forest Act habitat types (brookside forests, herb-rich forests, cliff-forests). Threatened species were found only in 9%, red-listed species in 29% and indicator species in 50% of the study sites. Populations of the target species were mainly very small, half of them on no more than one tree, and thus prone to extinction. Picea abies, Populus tremula and Sorbus aucuparia were the most important host tree species for indicator lichens. The Forest Act habitats appear to make only a limited contribution to the conservation of indicator and red-listed lichens. This is because delimited Forest Act habitats are small-sized sites and rarely harbour old forest stands. Moreover, even selective logging and felling of individual trees, which are generally permitted in Forest Act habitats, can decrease the persistence of epiphytic lichens. Thus, the biodiversity goals integrated in the Forest Act appear to be incompletely realized in current forestry practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Successful biodiversity conservation needs to be based on reliable data regarding the distribution and abundance of species. Red Lists summarize the status of rare and declining species. Here we present the first detailed survey (10 in x 10 in resolution) of nationally red-listed bryophytes and lichens at stand level in boreal forests. 30 managed forest production stands in boreal Sweden, soon to be harvested, were surveyed in detail regarding red-listed bryophytes and lichens. On the 180 ha totally investigated, 33 red-listed species were found, representing 35% of all forest red-listed bryophytes and lichens so far recorded from this part of Sweden. The mean number of red-listed species per stand was 10 and varied between 5 and 16. Excluding three species which were so common that, given the time-limit, it was not possible to record all of their occurrences, there were on average 6 number of observations ha(-1). The presence and density exceed those earlier found in 'key habitats', defined as hot-spots for red-listed species. Almost all observations were made on trees, with 48% on living trees and 52% on dead. Altitude, area and stem volume explained 67% of the red-list species density. The results highlight the importance of unprotected areas for rare and declining species and point to a hitherto unacknowledged high biodiversity value of mature managed boreal forest stands, shaped by a less intense forestry than today's. It also raises questions regarding the use of red-listed species to identify areas of importance to biodiversity. Objective and systematic surveys of red-listed species in the forest landscape, including younger stands, are urgent.

AB  - The Finnish red list shows that the epiphytic lichen flora of Finnish forests is highly threatened and declining steeply. Red lists provide limited information on the habitat associations of threat-ened species, which could be relevant in informing management and conservation measures. We used documented empirical data and expert assessments to determine for each red-listed (IUCN categories Near Threatened, NT; Vulnerable, VU; Endangered, EN; Critically Endangered, CR; Regionally Extinct, RE) epiphytic lichen species of Finland the following key habitat associations: host tree species, substrate type, habitat type, geographical distribution, preferred microclimate, and minimum required forest and tree age. The most important host tree species were Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. and Populus tremula L. Other tree species of high importance included Sorbus aucu-paria L. and Salix caprea L. One fourth of red-listed epiphytic lichens were primarily lignicolous. Most species required old-growth forests (required by 41% of species) or old trees (52%), but many species required only mature forests (36%) or trees (35%). The microclimatic preferences of most red-listed epiphytic lichens consisted of high or intermediate light availability and humidity. Most species whose status had deteriorated were dependent on deciduous trees. The continuous availability of old deciduous trees (especially Populus, Salix and Sorbus) requires special attention in both managed and protected forests. Red-listed epiphytic lichens would be aided by increased forest protection or transitioning to less intensive management regimes.

AB  - In Sweden ca. 20 000 ha forestland is fertilised each year. By using red-listed and 'signal' bryophytes and lichens as indicators, we investigated whether forest stands planned for fertilisation have a biodiversity value, and thus if restrictions due to conservation aspects are motivated. Species occurrences were registered in detailed line-transect analysis, with a record size of 10 x 10 m, in 74 coniferous forest stands with a mean age of 57 years in East-Central Sweden. On the 230 ha totally surveyed, 10 red-listed and 37 signal species were found. The mean number of records ha(-1) of red-listed bryophytes and lichens was 0.26 ha(-1), which is considerably less than previously found in mature production stands and woodland key habitats. Red-listed species were found in 31% of the stands and signal species in 95%. More than 70% of all records of red-listed species and 30% of the records of the signal species were found in moist micro-sites. If rare bryophytes and lichens are to be preserved in fertilisation stands, improved instructions regarding avoidance of important micro-sites are needed.

AB  - The human impact on nature has now reached a level at which the well-being of future human society is at risk. Therefore, transformative change in society is needed. Environmental assessments contribute to shaping environmental policy, potentially leveraging transformative change. Red Lists are a key information source on the state of biodiversity. Our aim was to study the Red List authors' perceptions of how Red Lists contribute to leveraging sustainability changes. We interviewed 15 of the authors of the forest and peatland sections of the Finnish Red List of Ecosystems 2018. We used the framework of sustainability leverage points to locate sustainability changes that Red Lists have leveraged in the social part of the Finnish social-ecological system. Our results show how the assessors perceived the influence of the Red Lists at most of the leverage points, including the deepest ones, and how these influences simultaneously co-exist in several leverage points. The most prominent sustainability changes were linked with legislation and information flows, whereas current paradigms, system goals and legislation appeared to prevent Red Lists from leveraging sustainability changes in Finland. We conclude that the production and dissemination processes of Red List knowledge can make an important contribution to sustainability changes.

AB  - Aim Restoration of habitats may be used as a conservation tool when ecosystems have lost their natural structure, dynamics or functioning over large areas. Controlled and planned use of fire could be an effective way to restore habitats of many threatened species in boreal forests where fire suppression has been effective. We asked whether the large-scale landscape context affects the occurrence of rare and threatened species in forest habitats that have been burned to restore their fire-related structures.
   Location Boreal forests in southern Finland.
   Methods We designed a large-scale field experiment that included nine Pinus sylvestris forests (5-10 ha each) in southern Finland. Sites were located in two regions: (1) in eastern region with shorter management history and (2) in western region where intensive forestry has continued longer. We evaluated whether restoration of dead/burned wood is beneficial for rare and conservation-dependent species and measured the recovery of pyrophilous and red-listed insects (beetles and flatbugs) in burned forests, using standardized sampling effort. Altogether, 956 individuals of 29 red-listed and pyrophilous species were sampled.
   Results Rare species colonized areas quickly, but there was a clear difference in species richness between the regions. The eastern forests harboured higher species richness after restoration. In these sites, the average species richness was 13.7 species per site, whereas in western forests it was 5.0 species per site. Similar pattern was also observed in subgroups: the corresponding numbers for pyrophilous species were 9.7 vs. 3.8, for red-listed 8.7 vs. 2.3 and for red-listed pyrophiles 4.7 vs. 1.2.
   Main conclusions Introducing fire back to boreal forests can aid in the recovery of rare species, but the landscape context considerably affects the success of restoring species. If restored habitats are located in landscapes that have lost their natural properties long ago, the success of restoration seems to be more challenging than in landscapes where habitats have been modified more recently.

   Species-area relationships are often applied, but not generally approved, to guide practical conservation planning. The specific species group analysed may affect their applicability. We asked if species-area curves constructed from extensive databases of various sectors of natural resource administration can provide insights into large-scale conservation of boreal forest biodiversity if the analyses are restricted only to red-listed species.
   Location
   Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods
   Our data included 12,645 records of 219 red-listed Coleoptera and Fungi from the whole of Finland. The forest data also covered the entire country, 202,761 km(2). The units of species-area analyses were 224 municipalities where the red-listed forest species have been observed. We performed a hierarchical partitioning analysis to reveal the relative importance of different potential explanatory variables. Based on the results, for all red-listed species, species associated with coniferous trees and for Fungi, the area of economically over-aged forests explained the best the variation in data. For species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera, the forest area explained better variation in data than the area of old forests. In the subsequent log-log species-area regression analyses, we used the best variables as the explanatory variable for each species group.
   Results
   There was a strong relationship between the number of all red-listed species and the area of old forests remaining, with a z-value of 0.45. The area explained better the number of species associated with conifer trees and Fungi than the number of species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera.
   Main conclusions
   The high z-values of species-area curves indicate that the remaining old-growth patches constitute a real archipelago for the conifer-associated red-listed species, since lower values had been expected if the surrounding habitat matrix were a suitable habitat for the species analysed.

KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - This paper characterises range structures of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) occurring in Finland and classifies species as resource (host plant), substrate (specific host plant qualities) or climate limited. This information is then used to evaluate whether the IUCN red-list classification applied in Finland is directed towards peripheral European populations. Thirty (37%) longhorn beetle species are red-listed in Finland. Limited host plant distribution is adequate in explaining the red-list status for 43% of the red-listed species. All of these species are dependent on hardwood trees. Of the red-listed species that are dependent on widespread host plants, 30% have a limited extent of occurrence as well as a small area of occupancy in Finland. As these species are widespread outside Fennoscandia, their range in Finland is most likely limited by climate. Twenty per cent of the red-listed species have a wide extent of occurrence, albeit a small area of occupancy in Finland. As these species are dependent on widespread host plant species, but require specific substrate qualities (e.g. decaying, large diameter trunks), it is likely that their range is restricted by anthropogenic activities, mainly forestry and agriculture. The present study shows that the red-list classification in Finland is directed towards peripheral European populations. This study, however, did not address the conservation value of these populations.

AB  - The existence of the wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) in North Europe is under threat. Urgent measures are needed to protect this species. One of the main measures under consideration is the development of a network of Protected Areas (PAs). The Russian part of the Finnish-Russian Friendship Nature Reserve includes a part of the Metsola Biosphere Reserve (MBR). The MBR contains habitats of the Kuhmo Area - Lake Kiitehenjarvi's (Lake Kamennoe) R.t. fennicus subpopulation and it is of great importance for this animal. This area mainly includes summer pastures and rutting and calving areas, while some of these animals also use this area as winter pastures. Tracking animal locations and moving activity with telemetry showed the continuation of seasonal migrations of this animal across the Russian-Finnish border. This confirms the mix of animals living in Finland in the region of Kainuu and animals living in the Republic of Karelia (Russia), as well as the importance of the MBR for maintaining the genetic diversity of R.t. fennicus in both countries. Some of the animals may change their migration patterns and seasonal home ranges, staying in Russia for wintering. There was one case of a collared R.t. fennicus female moving far to the east from the Kuhmo Area - Lake Kiitehenjarvi subpopulation's habitat to the surroundings of the village of Chernyi Porog (Segezhsky district). The genetic purity of R.t. fennicus is influenced by the reindeer husbandry practice in Finland. There are cases of semi-domesticated reindeer (i.e. originating from another Rangifer tarandus subspecies, R. t. tarandus) occurrence in the MBR, where they were observed in mating (harem) groups of R. t. fennicus. Evaluation and analysis of the age and sex structure of the subpopulation in the summer-autumn period in Russia in 2018-2020 showed a small percentage of calves, approximately 12% of all encountered animals. This may indicate a high predator pressure (e.g. from the side of Canis lupus, Gulo gulo, and Ursus arctos). Over the last three years, out of 16 collared R.t. fennicus females appeared in Karelia, four of them were killed by predators. The location of the habitats near the state border west of the fence, protected with barbed wire (engineered structures) together with control in the PAs (including MBR) ensure the animal protection from poachers. There was only one case of animal death caused by illegal hunting over the last five years. Forest logging may have a significant impact on the future of R.t. fennicus in the MBR. Under conditions of increasing human impact on the surrounding areas, the MBR importance in the R.t. fennicus population conservation also increased. However, to enhance the positive effect, it will be necessary to expand the network of PAs. One of the nearest promising potential PAs is the planned Kalevala Sanctuary.

AB  - The three major threats to lichens in Sweden; forestry, air pollution, and structural changes in the agricultural landscape, are outlined. Forestry is the most serious. The majority of the red-listed lichens in forests are found in productive forests with a continuity in tree growth, but nearly 70% of the protected area in Sweden consists of alpine landscapes. Examples of important habitats with red-listed lichens are described, e.g. Alnus glutinosa marshes, alvar-vegetation, broad-leaved deciduous forests and different Picea abies forests. The use of selected indicator species of lichens and microfungi (mainly red-listed species) in boreal coniferous forests provides information on continuity in tree growth of an area, and on earlier influences of forestry. Examples of indicator species for different types of forest are presented and discussed. In spite of the Swedish 'right of common access', collecting of lichens is forbidden without permission from the land-owner. Collecting in protected areas is allowed only with a permit obtained from the authorities.

AB  - Black listing and red listing of species are two of few available tools for dealing with alien species spread and biodiversity loss. This paper sets out to address the categorizations of plants as alien and often black listed or, alternatively, native and often red listed and argues that these categories are portrayed as scientifically neutral within environmental management and conservation efforts while being founded on value-laden and constructed temporal thresholds. Based on Quentin Skinner's perspective of concepts as speech acts the paper explores how categorizations of plants are perceived and 'practiced' among actors in a landscape development process, namely a qualitative case study of the redevelopment of the former main Norwegian airport, Fornebu in Oslo, into a green site for housing, business and recreation. Here, conservationists clashed with the planners and landscape architects over the planting of alien species. The Fornebu conflict illustrates how black listing and red listing are founded on a sense of time which largely implies idealizing and preserving certain 'natural' conditions, processes or landscapes in a 'frozen' state serving as a measuring stick for the future. The paper demonstrates the need for making implicit values in environmental management and planning more explicit in order to meet environmental challenges related to alien, invasive species spread and biodiversity loss.

AB  - Red-listed species are negatively affected by habitat degradation and fragmentation. They usually have small populations and may be affected by local extinctions which makes species distribution modeling (SDM) challenging. Although SDM has been used extensively for biodiversity protection and regional land-use planning, the transferability of SDM between regions is still at the developmental level. We show a first attempt to demonstrate model transferability for red-listed plant species over boreal regions. We modeled the distribution of 34 red-listed boreal peatland plant species at national and regional levels, using multiple streams of environmental data in Finland. The objectives were: (1) to evaluate how environmental characteristics explaining species distribution differ between three regions covering five vegetation zones (subarctic, northern, middle, southern boreal, and hemi-boreal vegetation zones); (2) to assess the performance of one national and three regional species distribution models (SDM: northern, middle, and southern regions); and (3) to test whether the regional models can be transferred to other regions and discuss alternative methods to improve transferability. The maximum entropy (maxent) algorithm was employed to predict suitable habitats for the assessed species. An SDM performance was measured with the area under the receiver operative characteristics (AUC), true skill statistics (TSS), and the continuous Boyce index (CBI). Three conclusions are relevant. First, the environmental variables explaining species distribution differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the three regions. Second, the internal measure of accuracy measured as cross-validation of AUC, TSS, and the CBI was quite similar in both the national and regional models, which indicates that realistic species distribution maps could be generated from all models. Last, the external measure of accuracy (i.e. transferability) in the regional models was lower than the internal measure of accuracy, which indicates that a good regional model could not automatically ensure good performance when transferred to another region. To improve the transferability of the regional models, we suggest the normalizing of environmental variable values. The data-driven evaluation of red-listed plant species provides an approach that can be used in biodiversity and nature conservation.

AB  - Traits such as poor dispersal ability and high habitat specificity are thought to predispose some species to a greater risk of extinction than others. Habitat preferences and morphological features associated with dispersal ability were compared between red-listed species and common congenerics co-occurring in boreal forests in northern Sweden. Measurements of body size, wing loading and wing aspect ratio were used to compare dispersal abilities, while catches from experimental treatments of dead wood were used to compare habitat preferences. We also compared how restricted red-listed species were to particular sites or habitats relative to common species. The red-listed Epuraea longipennis was longer and wider, while Epuraea. deubeli weighed less than common Epuraea species. In contrast to expectations, these red-listed species had a larger wing area (relative to their body mass) and thus a lower wing-loading than congeneric species, suggesting superior dispersal abilities. The red-listed Tachinus elegans possessed intermediate morphological characteristics, compared with common congenerics. However, the relationships between the P risk of extinction in fragmented habitats and size and dispersal ability are likely to be scale-dependent, so intermediate or superior dispersal abilities may increase extinction risk at some scales. Red-listed species were not found in fewer sites or habitat types than congenerics so were not more likely to be habitat specialists. However, some red-listed species preferred deeply shaded and Fomitopsis pinicola-inoculated logs, relative to congenerics, suggesting that specificity to these particular microhabitats may be connected with extinction risk.

AB  - Habitat loss, fragmentation, and declining habitat quality have created an extinction debt in boreal forests, which could be partly reversed by deliberately improving the habitat quality in managed areas outside reserves. Me studied the effects of green-tree retention and controlled burning on red-listed and rare, deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles in a large-scale field experiment in eastern Finland. Our factorial study design included 24 sites dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and with three levels of green-tree retention (0, 10, and 50 m(3)/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned in 2001. We sampled beetles with 10 flight-intercept traps on each site during the years 2000-2002 (i.e., 1 pretreatment and 2 post-treatment years). A total sample of 153,449 individuals representing 1, 160 beetle species yielded 2,10 7 specimens of 84 red-listed or rare saproxylic species, The richness of these species was higher on the burned than on the unburned sites, and higher levels of green-tree retention promoted species richness, but there were clear differences between the years. The richness of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased in the first post-treatment year evidently due to the treatments, continued to increase on the burned sites in the second post-treatment year but decreased on the unburned sites. Our results showed that the living conditions of many red-listed and rare saproxylic species could be improved significantly with rather simple alterations to forest management methods. Controlled burning with high levels of green-tree retention creates resources for many saproxylic species, but increasing the levels of green-tree retention in unburned areas can also be beneficial.

AB  - Cold-adapted ecosystems are often considered to be stable, species poor, and well protected. However, such ecosystems have been identified as being especially sensitive to threats from global warming. Despite this, recent studies have found low proportions of Red Listed species in these systems. In this study we explored the number of alpine species (dependent on alpine habitats for their survival) and their Red List status in Sweden. We determined the proportion of Red Listed species and explored discrepancies among different groups of organisms in terms of the proportion of Red Listed species and the criteria used for Red Listing. We found a total of 389 alpine species in twelve analyzed species groups. The overall proportion of Red Listed species was 29%, with 15% regarded as threatened. There were substantial differences among taxonomic groups with respect to the proportion of Red Listed species. Among mammals 75% of the species are Red Listed, along with 63% of butterflies and 50% of birds. In addition the single alpine dragonfly species and all three alpine stinging wasp species are also Red Listed. Although beetles, bumblebees and grasshoppers are represented by a total of 17 alpine species, none are Red Listed. In contrast to previous studies, our results show that the proportion of Red Listed species is high in alpine environments, indicating that ecosystems found above the tree line are indeed threatened. No species in Sweden have been Red Listed on the basis of the IUCN criterion E (unfavorable quantitative analysis), this is surprising since entire cold-adapted ecosystems are likely to disappear in the future. We highlight the need for a better and more coordinated application of the IUCN criteria, as well as a more stringent strategy to assess the extinction risks for alpine species, thus maintaining reliable Red Lists.

AB  - The long-term success of sites selected for species conservation depends on the persistence of target species. Red List species or threatened species lists are frequently defined as target species, but when Red Lists are updated, their species composition may change. Here we investigate the effects of Red List updates on the long-term robustness of fine-scale site selection. We used records of red-listed species (vascular plants, bryophytes, macrolichens, and polypore fungi) recorded in 1997-1998 in 1058 sample plots (50 x 50 m) from six forest landscapes in Norway, and four consecutive issues of the Norwegian Red List for species (1998, 2006, 2010, 2015). Sites were selected based on the first issue (1998) using both a scoring ("hotspot") approach and a complementarity approach, and the ability of selected sites to include red-listed species of later issues was measured. In four boreal forests the mean proportion of red-listed species included in selected sites were reduced by 18% during the study period, whereas no such effect was found in two hemiboreal forests, where increased clustering of red-listed species in sites compensated for target species changes. Changing target species adds to earlier documented challenges caused by population dynamics, and we suggest that alternatives to using occurrences of target species in site selection should be considered, and particularly at finer spatial scales.

AB  - Intensive forestry practices have led to fragmentation of habitats that have high conservation value and has reduced the availability of deadwood in forests. This has in turn, led to a decline in species associated with deadwood (e.g. saproxylic beetles). Conservation measures have been developed in order to halt the negative trend in forest biodiversity, both at local and landscape scales. Ecoparks are large forest landscapes, with at least 50% of the forestland being managed with enhanced conservation concern including legal and voluntary protection or restoration of forests. Ecoparks aim to combine production, nature conservation and recreation (e.g. berry picking, hiking, hunting, fishing) and thereby represent multifunctional forest landscapes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether ecoparks can sustain greater diversity of saproxylic beetles than conventionally managed production landscapes, and whether the local habitat amount and diversity can have an additional effect on species assemblages. Two ecoparks and two representative conventional production landscapes, which implement a rotation forestry with general nature consideration, were selected for the study. Beetles were collected during three years in sun-exposed plots, where local (20 m radius) forest structures were measured. We found that both ecoparks sustained greater abundance and richness of nationally red-listed beetles (IUCN classes NT, VU, EN) and contained different beetle assemblages in comparison with conventional landscapes. Local deadwood volume had a positive relationship with the richness and abundance of saproxylic and red-listed beetles in the southern study area (long history of land-use), but not in the north (short history of landuse), partially supporting habitat amount hypothesis (HAH) at the local scale. Instead, the responses of beetles to deadwood diversity showed inconclusive results, varying between years and study areas. Our results highlight the potential of multifunctional forests in conserving biodiversity of saproxylic beetle species, especially redlisted species, as well as the importance of local deadwood availability.

AB  - Carnivores-livestock interactions cause human-wildlife conflicts worldwide. These interactions are present under a wide range of ecological and economic circumstances. This paper studies the relationship between predation mortality and natural mortality, when food availability affects natural mortality of the livestock. Semi-domestic Saami reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) herding in Norway is used as a case study. When predation affects reindeer density, food competition among reindeer changes, which changes weights and natural mortality in the reindeer population. An age-structured bio-economic model is presented, where this relationship is taken into account. While predation mortality may be additional to natural mortality in absence of food limitation, it can compensate for natural mortality in situations of food scarcity. Furthermore, due to density dependency in livestock weights, predation may increase the meat value of livestock. The paper analyzes how predation affects livestock production and economic performance under an optimized management scheme. One main result is that predation shifts the optimal harvesting composition towards calf harvesting and, therefore, the optimal stock composition among the different categories of animals. This contrasts findings in the existing bioeconomic literature. Furthermore, a changing harvesting pattern towards calf harvest is an important adjustment that highly limits the negative impact on profit of predation.

AB  - Farmland birds have declined in large areas of western and northern Europe. This decline has been connected with changes in the agricultural landscape. We studied the effects of landscape composition on birds in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in SW Finland. This study was carried out with a grid-based approach: bird pairs were counted in 105 grid squares of 25 ha within an area of 26.25 km(2). The total density of farmland birds and density of red-listed species were related to the land cover variables using generalized linear modelling (GLM). Farmland birds consist of a variable group of species either breeding or feeding in agricultural land. The model explained a moderate proportion (49%) of the variation in the total density of farmland birds in the landscape. In a regression analysis cover of non-arable agricultural land (semi-natural grasslands, built-up areas) explained a much higher proportion (r(2)=0.49) of the variation in farmland bird density than that of arable land (cultivated fields and set-aside fields, r(2)=0.04). Semi-natural grasslands, which have drastically declined throughout NW Europe, and built-up areas (mainly farmyards) had the most significant positive effects on the density of red-listed species. The results emphasize the significance of semi-natural grasslands for the declining red-listed farmland bird species. Birds are usually not restricted to certain patches of habitat but use several patches in their home range. Thus, when studying bird-landscape relations for land use planning, we also recommend grid-based approaches covering the whole landscape variation.

AB  - Setting aside parcels of land is the main conservation strategy to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss worldwide. Because funding for biological conservation is limited, it is important to distinguish the most efficient ways to use it. Here, we assess implications of alternative measures to conserve biodiversity in managed boreal forest landscapes. We calculated four alternative spatio-temporal scenarios and compared these to the current management regime over 100-year time period. In the alternative scenarios, a fixed amount of funding was invested in (1) permanent large reserves (each tens of ha in size), (2) permanent small reserves (each a few ha in size), (3) temporary small reserves (based on 10-year contracts with private land owners), and (4) green-tree retention (small groups of trees retained on clear-cuts). To assess biodiversity implications, we used habitat suitability indices to calculate overall habitat availability for five groups of red-listed and habitat-specific species associated with decaying spruce logs. The possibilities for timber harvests did not differ among the scenarios, but biodiversity performance was different. The scenarios with permanent reserves tended to outperform other scenarios, suggesting that conservation policies based on permanent reserves are the most cost-efficient in the long term. Results, however, varied among time scales and species groups. In the short term, a strategy of investment in temporary small reserves was the most efficient. Habitat for species associated with old spruce dead-wood and preferring shade was rare throughout all simulations, and therefore, it is likely that these species cannot be sustained in managed forests. Species that live on fresh dead-wood and are associated with forest edges coped well in all scenarios suggesting that such species will persist in managed landscapes without additional conservation efforts. Explicit definition of conservation objectives and time frames for conservation action are thus prerequisites for successful conservation planning.

AB  - Information about forest biodiversity has so far been collected mostly by using field inventories, but it is desirable to find other methods that can cover large areas at a lower cost. In a forest landscape covering 2000 ha in southern Sweden we tested if colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs on the scale of 1:30000 can be used to interpret forest stand characteristics correlated to the occurrence of epiphytic lichens that are Red-listed or otherwise indicate high nature conservation value ('signal species'). Using logistic regression we found that the interpreted stand variables tree height and crown structure class were significantly correlated to the occurrence of Red-listed species. For signal species, the variables tree height, percentage of southern deciduous trees and crown structure class were significantly correlated to the occurrence. The logistic regression models successfully predicted a significantly higher probability to find Red-listed species in the stands that actually contained such species compared to stands without Red-listed species. The same was true for stands with signal species. We conclude that interpretation of CIR aerial photographs could be a useful method to find certain groups of epiphytic lichens in surveys covering large areas.

AB  - The estimated number of woodland key habitats (WKHs) in Sweden is 60,000-70,000. WKHs according to definition should contain red-listed species, but this is rarely investigated. Indicator species are used as one tool to identify the WKHs. In two forest regions in south-east Sweden with contrasting proportions of WKHs, red-listed and indicator vascular plant species were recorded in line transects and as a comparison also in surrounding production forests. 2370 recordings were made in 25 WKHs (45 ha) and in 74 ha production forest. Differences in vascular plant flora were small between WKHs and production forests within areas but were substantial for production forests between areas. Only one red-listed vascular plant species was found and in very small numbers. The results indicate that vascular plants are not optimal to use as indicators of WKHs and some species ought to be omitted from the indicator list. Methods to discern indicator species are discussed and the results are applied to practical forestry and conservation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In an earlier study (Franc et al., 2007), local species richness of saproxylic oak beetles (including red-listed beetles) in forests was predicted mainly by the landscape (area of woodland key habitat within 1 km of plots). Such results are important for conservation work, but need to be backed up well, for reliable advice. We tested a two-stage method that improved our earlier models and our advice for conservation planning. We studied temperate mixed forest, rich in oaks Quercus robur/Quercus petraea, in a large landscape in Sweden. Franc et al. (2007) analysed 21 forests. Here we selected the significant explanatory variables (predictors) and other biologically relevant predictors, used the earlier 21 forests and sampled 11 new forests such that we expanded the range on the axes of the predictors. We collected in total 320 species of saproxylic oak beetles (23,137 individuals) of which 65 and 38 were red-listed (IUCN criteria, Swedish list 2000 and 2005, respectively). We partly confirmed our original results, but the results also changed in important ways: local species richness is now predicted by a combination of local, landscape and regional factors. Moreover, a local variable (dead wood) was the main predictor of saproxylic oak beetles (all species included), while for red-listed saproxylic oak beetles the landscape (woodland key habitat within 1 km of plots) was the main predictor, of local species richness. Thus, species richness of red-listed saproxylic oak beetles seems to depend mainly on landscapes factors, while total species richness of saproxylic oak beetles seems to depend more on local stand factors. We conclude that a two-stage research design can be useful in landscape and conservation studies, especially for species-rich taxa that require large samples per site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An ongoing large-scale survey has revealed that there are 60-70 000 'woodland key habitats' in Sweden, covering at least 1% of the productive forestland. According to definition they should contain red-listed species, but no inventories of these species have been made and instead the survey has been based on indirect criteria like natural forest characteristics and indicator species. We compared red-listed and indicator bryophytes between woodland key habitats (WKHs) and production forests (PFs) in two areas (500 and 600 km(2)) in south-east Sweden, using randomized sampling and with line-transect analysis. The number of records per hectare (one record = presence in a 10 m x 10 m) of red-listed bryophytes in the WKHs was 0.4 and 4, and in the PFs 0.5 and 0.8, depending on area. In only one of the areas, did WKHs have significantly more records per hectare and a larger number of red-listed bryophyte species log ha(-1) than the PFs. The cumulative species richness for indicator species and red-listed species together was significantly higher in WKHs compared with PFs in both areas, to judge from the confidence bands of species accumulation curves. Positive correlations between red-listed species and indicator species regarding their number as well as their abundance in the WKHs support the use and selection of indicator species. Our results show that WKHs do not necessarily have a higher density of red-listed bryophyte species than PFs, especially when compared with mature PFs. A more complete picture would be achieved if different forest types and age classes were investigated separately, in a replicated design. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Consistent information on threatened habitat types is needed for land use planning and for prioritizing conservation, management, and restoration actions. However, detailed background data for assessing extinction risks of habitat types exists only in few countries. We present a new, flexible procedure for assigning habitat types into Red List Categories similar to those used for species by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The procedure allows variation in the character or scale of assessment units and it is applicable even with incomplete data. The assessment protocol consists of two primary criteria: the change in the quantity and the change in the quality of the habitat type. The criteria are analyzed by expert groups with a transparent and repeatable stepwise procedure. The quantitative and qualitative changes in habitat types over the last 50 years serve as a starting point for the assessment, and the status is adjusted by assessing sub-criteria that address earlier changes, predicted future change, and the overall commonness or rarity of the habitat type. We also report the main results of the first assessment of threatened habitat types in Finland, and illustrate the application of the criteria by two case studies.

AB  - There are ca. 70 000 "woodland key habitats" (WKHs) in Sweden that according to definition should contain red-listed species, but their species content is seldom known. Indicator species are used as one tool to identify the WKHs. In two areas in southern Sweden red-listed and indicator lichen species were surveyed in line transects in a total of 25 WKHs (45 ha) and, for comparison, in 74 ha of surrounding production forest. Altogether 19 red-listed species, representing ca. 25% of the Swedish Red List forest lichen species so far recorded from the study areas, and 35 indicator species were found. Ninety-five percent of all records were epiphytic. The most evident result from this study was the large difference in the number of species records in the production forests between the two study areas. In contrast, the WKHs in both areas had a similar number of species records. The WKHs were expected to be significantly richer than the production forests in regard to the occurrence of indicator and red-listed species, but this was only found to be true in one of the areas. In both areas there was a tendency for the rarest red-listed species to be confined to the WKHs. Nestedness and correlation analyses suggested that Arthonia vinosa was a relevant indicator of red-listed lichens; however, Calicium parvum was found to be inappropriate as an indicator species. It is concluded that at the regional scale the production forest can host considerable amounts of indicator and red-listed lichen species but that the WKHs are important for the preservation of rare lichens.

AB  - 1. The Finnish Red Lists from 2000 and 2010 were used to calculate for the first time the national Red List Index for the order Lepidoptera and different Lepidoptera families with data from 2245 species.
   2. We grouped species according to their primary habitats and analysed each habitat's RLI as well.
   3. The overall RLI was significantly negative, reflecting the worsening of the group as a whole in the country.
   4. A significant negative trend was found for families Tortricidae, Gelechiidae and Hesperiidae and for coastal habitats.
   5. We also report that 76 Lepidoptera species newly established a population in Finland between 2000 and 2010, probably expanding northwards driven by climate warming.

AB  - Restoration of habitats is critically important in preventing full realization of the extinction debt owed as a result of anthropogenic habitat destruction. Although much emphasis has been placed on macrohabitats, suitable microhabitats are also vital for the survival of most species. The aim of this large-scale field experiment was to evaluate the relative importance of manipulated microhabitats, i.e., dead wood substrates of spruce (snags, and logs that were burned, inoculated with wood fungi or shaded) and macrohabitats, i.e., stand types (clear-cuts, mature managed forests, and forest reserves) for species richness, abundance and assemblage composition of all saproxylic and red-listed saproxylic beetles. Beetles were collected in emergence traps in 30 forest stands in 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2006. More individuals emerged from snags and untreated logs than from burned and shaded logs, but species richness did not differ among substrates. Assemblage composition differed among substrates for both all saproxylics and red-listed saproxylic species, mainly attributed to different assemblage composition on snags. This suggests that the practise of leaving snags for conservation purposes should be complemented with log supplementation. Clear-cuts supported fewer species and different assemblages from mature managed forests and reserves. Neither abundance, nor species richness or assemblage composition differed between reserves and mature managed forests. This suggests that managed stands subjected to selective cutting, not clear-felling, maintain sufficient old growth characteristics and continuity to maintain more or less intact assemblages of saproxylic beetles. Thus, alternative management methods, e. g., continuity forestry should be considered for some of these stands to maintain continuity and conservation values. Furthermore, the significantly higher estimated abundance per ha of red-listed beetles in reserves underlines the importance of reserves for maintaining viable populations of rare red-listed species and as source areas for saproxylic species in boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - We used habitat suitability modeling to investigate whether the 15% ecosystem restoration target set in the previous Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and EU Biodiversity strategy targets, is sufficient to safeguard red-listed mire plant species. We assessed six theoretical restoration scenarios for drained peatland landscapes by altering the proportion of drained and undrained peatland area in 25-ha grid cells. The proportions represented steps when 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75% and 100% of the drained peatland is restored. We modelled the habitat suitability for 48 red-listed plant species in the aapa mire region in boreal Finland. Model outcomes were assessed at the level of five species groups: calcareous species, rich fen species, decaying wood species, mesotrophic fen species, and spruce swamp species. The predicted distribution increased for 34 (71%) of the 48 red listed plant species when 15% of drained peatland area was predicted to be restored. At the same time the potentially occupied area of species increased by 9%. In the scenario where all peatlands were restored, the predicted distribution of 43 (90%) of species increased, and on average the distribution of species quadrupled. According to our predictions, meeting the 15% ecosystem restoration target, set in the previous CBD and EU Biodiversity strategy targets would be beneficial for most of the boreal red-listed mire plant species, but a larger restoration area would expand their distribution considerably more. Our study shows that a landscape level approach is important to assess thresholds for the potential biodiversity benefits arising from peatland restoration. The models can also be used to select suitable areas for restoration. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Strong anthropogenic pressures on global forests necessitate that managed forests be evaluated as habitat for biodiversity. The complex pattern of habitat types created in forestry systems is ideal for analyses through the theoretical framework of alpha (local), gamma (total) and beta (compositional) diversity. Here I use saproxylic beetles, a species-rich threatened group, to compare four Norway spruce-dominated habitats representative of the boreal forest landscape of northern Europe: unmanaged semi-natural stands, nature reserves, unthinned middle-aged production stands and commercially thinned production stands. The beetles (in total 38 085 individuals of 312 species), including red-listed ones and three feeding guilds (wood consumers, fungivores and predators) were studied in 53 stands in central-southern Sweden, in two regions with differing amounts of conservation forest. Alpha diversity of saproxylic, but not red-listed, beetles was higher in the thinned stands than in the semi-natural stands, and did not differ for the other forest types. Beta diversity of saproxylic beetles was higher in unmanaged semi-natural stands than in the other forest types, but species composition did not differ noticeably. Furthermore, red-listed saproxylic beetles had higher gamma diversity in unmanaged semi-natural stands in the region with more conservation forest, but not in the one with less such forest. The local factors dead wood volume and dead wood diversity did not influence alpha diversity of beetles, but increasing canopy openness had a minor negative influence on saproxylic and red-listed beetles. While the local scale (alpha diversity) indicates the potential for managed forests to house many saproxylic beetle species associated with spruce forests in this boreal landscape, the larger scales (beta and gamma diversity) indicate the value of unmanaged forests for the conservation of the entire saproxylic beetle fauna. These results show the importance of analyses at multiple levels of diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) for identifying patterns relevant to conservation.

AB  - Meaningfulness is a fundamental aspect in the promotion of frail older adults' health and well-being. From a salutogenic point of view, meaningfulness is a vital component of a sense of coherence (SOC), since having a strong SOC aids toward assembling the resources needed to cope with stressors and manage tensions with success. In order to respond to the challenges of population aging and the need to enable frail older adults to live at home for as long as possible, it is important to explore their meaningfulness in the context of home-based care. A salutogenic framework was used to study meaningfulness. The aim was to explore what promotes meaningfulness among frail older adults. The study uses a hermeneutical approach and has a qualitative design. In total, 17 frail older adults were interviewed. The data were analyzed by content analysis. The results uncovered four themes that the respondents considered important in enhancing meaningfulness in daily life: home care personnel, outdoor activities and green spaces, cultural activities and spirituality. Our study revealed the important role of home care personnel as a resource in promoting meaningfulness in the context of home-based care. Hence, this group should be given sufficient resources, knowledge and competence for enabling meaningfulness and thus a SOC amongst frail older adults.

AB  - Overexploitation of fish stocks causes concern not only to fisheries managers and conservation biologists, but also engages seafood consumers; more integrated product perspectives would be useful. This could be provided by life cycle assessment (LCA); however, further complements of present LCA methodology are needed to assess seafood production, one being by-catch impacts. We studied the scientific rationale behind using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (TM) for assessment of impacts relating to fish species' vulnerability. For this purpose, the current Red List status of marine fish in Sweden was compared to the advice given in fisheries as well as key life history traits known to indicate sensitivity to high fishing pressure. Further, we quantified the amount of threatened fish (vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered) that was discarded in demersal trawl fisheries on the Swedish west coast. The results showed that not only did the national Red List of marine fish have a high consistency with advice given in fisheries and indices of vulnerability, the different fishing practices studied were also found to have vastly different amounts of threatened fish discarded per kilo landing. The suggested approach is therefore promising as a carrier of aggregated information on the extent to which seafood production interferes with conservation priorities, in particular for species lacking adequate stock assessment. To enable extensive product comparisons, it is important to increase coverage of fish species by the global IUCN Red List, and to reconsider the appropriate assessment unit (species or stocks) in order to avoid false alarms.

AB  - Many wood-inhabiting fungi are today threatened as modern forestry practices drastically reduce the amount of dead wood available in various forest ecosystems. We investigated whether the occurrence of red-listed wood-inhabiting fungi differed between natural and managed forest landscapes adjacent to the timberline in the middle part of Sweden. We assessed whether environmental variables such as the degree of human impact, length of forest roads, dead wood volume and quality affected species richness and abundance. The effects of forestry on wood-inhabiting fungi have been assessed in several studies in lowland Swedish forests. Few studies have, however, been conducted in forest landscapes adjacent to the timberline in Sweden. This is potentially important since forests close to the Swedish mountains have been pointed out as one of few intact forest landscapes in Fennoscandia and they are subjected to increasing logging pressure. Similar to other studies, species numbers and abundances were positively correlated with larger volumes of logs in various decay stages. However, never shown previously, the length of forest roads was negatively correlated with species abundance and occurrence of red-listed species. We suggest that a low amount of forest roads can be used as a conservation indicator to localize still-intact forest landscapes.

AB  - In the Nordic countries, sets of Indicator (Signal) species, predominantly cryptogams, have been used as one measure to find forest stands which may harbour Red List species. Such data could potentially also be used to prioritise among stands for protection as nature reserves. We studied if the number of Signal species indicates the number of Red List species in oak-rich mixed forest in south Sweden. We also explored if species richness of the investigated groups is correlated with the number of Red List or Signal species. In 25 stands, we Surveyed epiphytic and epixylic bryophytes and lichens, ground-floor bryophytes, and wood-living fungi. We studied correlations for two datasets; (1) all forest species and (2) deciduous forest specialists. When relating the number of Signal species to the number of Red List species for each taxon and in total, a significant correlation was found for temperate deciduous forest lichens. The number of Signal species was further significantly correlated to total species richness for lichens (all forest species) and for wood-living fungi (both datasets). The number of Red List lichens was correlated to total lichen richness (deciduous forest species). Signal species seem not to be unequivocal in prioritising potential reserves among valuable oak-rich woodlands and surveys by Red List species experts may be needed. Signal species may be more useful for finding relatively valuable sites in a matrix of production forest. Moreover, Signal species seem to be useful surrogates for total cryptogam species richness.

AB  - Due to pressure to raise forest productivity in Sweden, there are proposals to apply more intensive forestry methods, but they could have potentially large effects on biodiversity. Here we report a compilation and evaluation of the extent and significance of such effects. We evaluated potential effects on biodiversity by introducing intensively fertilized Norway spruce plantations as a management option in Swedish forests with low conservation values on insects, vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes, and red-listed species. Due to a lack of specific studies addressing this question, we based the evaluation on a combination of available and appropriate empiric and anecdotic knowledge; literature data, and expert judgments largely available in species data bases. Our evaluations suggest that such forests will only harbor species that are common and widespread in conventionally managed stands and that species of conservation interest will be lacking, due to the low heterogeneity and light intensity of even-aged monocultures with dense canopies, short rotation times and low availability of coarse woody debris. Effects at the landscape scale are more difficult to evaluate, but will be dependent on the area utilized and the conservation value of sites used. We conclude that negative effects on biodiversity can be reduced if: (1) only land with the lowest conservational value is utilized; (2) plantations are spatially arranged to minimize fragmentation of the landscape; (3) the quality and quantity of key structural elements (e.g., coarse woody debris, old living trees and snags) are maintained at the landscape level; and (4) management intensity is relaxed on other land. For effective implementation of these measures, legislative frameworks and policy instruments need to be adjusted and new models for planning and monitoring need to be developed.

AB  - All Swedish forest land is at present being surveyed with the aim of mapping woodland key habitats which have an estimated number of ca. 70 000. An untested requirement of these habitats is that they should contain red-listed species. In order to investigate if they fulfill their aim, an inventory of nationally red-listed bryophytes and lichens was performed in ca. 120 randomly selected woodland key habitats distributed throughout the country. The species were recorded in line transects, covering the whole surface of the habitats. The mean number of red-listed species per habitat was 0.7 for bryophytes and 1.4 for lichens with 11 species at the richest site and 71% of the sites having at least one species. Nemoral forests and coniferous forests were the most species-rich habitat types. The habitats of northern Sweden were more species rich than the southern ones. There were weak correlations between presence of bryophytes and lichens. The study shows that a majority of the woodland key habitats contain red-listed bryophyte and lichen species. Further studies are needed in order to record more organism groups and to compare the woodland key habitats with the surrounding matrix forests.

AB  - Aapa mires are EU priority habitats that harbour unique biodiversity values but face increasing global change threats. Here, we investigate the exposure of red-listed aapa mire species inhabiting fen and flark fen habitats to the impacts of land use and climate change. Climate change-based threats were assessed across the aapa mire zone of Finland based on climate velocities (a metric describing the speed and direction of climate movement) measured for mean January temperature (TJan), growing degree days (GDD5) and mean annual water balance (WAB). Land use threats were assessed based on the cover of drainage ditches and three other adverse land use types around the species occurrences. Our results suggest that rapid changes in TJan may alter winter thermal conditions and thereby also species performance, particularly in the northernmost part of the aapa mire zone, where the most valuable concentrations of red-listed species are situated. The land use and GDD5 threats are highest in the southern regions where the red-listed aapa mire species occurrences are sparser but face severe risks to their persistence. In the central part of the aapa mire zone, a number of valuable aapa mires with red-listed species are exposed to both intermediately high TJan and GDD5 velocities and a spatially varying amount of ditching. Three conservation approaches to support the persistence of red-listed aapa mire species: (i) restora-tion, (ii) establishment of new protected areas, and (iii) monitoring of the key habitats, should be flexibly and complementarily applied to the preservation of aapa mires subject to accelerating climate change.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the abundance of wood-rotting fungus suggested as 'continuity indicator species' and environmental variables for the assemblage of saproxylic (wood-living) beetles associated with Fomitopsis pinicola fruiting bodies in a mature spruce forest in southeastern Norway. The presence of species thought to indicate continuity in old growth is one of the criteria used when finding and delineating small protected areas ('woodland key habitats') in Scandinavian forestry. Although it is clear that remnants of old-growth forest are important for many taxa, documentation as to which entities or species the indicator species indeed indicate is scarce. If stands with a continuous and unbroken input of dead wood have a unique assemblage of wood-rotting fungi, it seems relevant to ask if these stands also have a unique assemblage of rare saproxylic beetles. I find that the indicator species exhibit no significant correlations with beetle species richness or with the presence of red-listed saproxylic beetles as a group. The different characteristics of dead wood conditions are the most important environmental variables that explain both the species richness and the presence of red-listed beetles. Single-species analyses reveal contrasting relationships. The red-listed beetle Atomaria alpina shows a significant and positive association to the abundance of indicator species. Contrary, a group of three red-listed species with similar ecology in the family Cisidae exhibits a significant and negative association to indicator species abundance. This indicates that important patterns are concealed when considering general measures such as overall presence of red-listed beetles. Single-species studies are necessary in order to correctly understand how rare beetles respond to forestry activities and to develop a policy that can secure their continuing existence in the boreal forest.

LA  - English
AB  - The World Conservation Union (IUCN) criteria for classifying threatened species in Red Lists were constructed to be applied primarily on a global scale. Nonetheless, many nature conservation efforts are conducted at national levels and there is consequently a demand for Red Lists at subglobal scales. In 1999, a working group presented draft guidelines of how to apply the IUCN criteria at such levels. Meanwhile, the 1994 IUCN criteria were the subject of re-evaluation, resulting in the somewhat altered 2001 IUCN criteria. Experiences of applying the suggested guidelines for national Red Lists, particularly from Sweden and Finland, revealed that the system is applicable to a wide range of taxa and geographical scales, even though there are issues that remain to be resolved. A comparison of the classification outcome of species listed both at global and national levels has highlighted some incongruities.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify habitat preferences of red-listed epiphytic and epixylic bryophyte, lichenized and non-lichenized fungi species in woodland key habitats (WKHS) (areas less than 10 ha, where forest structures indicate occurrence of red-listed species) in southern Sweden. The relative importance of different groups of environmental factors was assessed with partial canonical correspondence analysis techniques and a cross-validation approach using data from 7196 selected WKHs. Different woody substrates (old trees, logs and snags) made up the most important variable group for occurrence of red-listed species (30% unique explainable variation). Species associated with Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies habitats, but also species associated with Quercus spp. and Populus tremula habitats showed distinct habitat preferences. The second most important variable group (16% unique explainable variation) was geographical location. A west-east gradient was identified, and species concentrated to Baltic islands in the east were separated from other species. This gradient, and an identified south-north gradient, probably reflect differences in temperatures and rainfall between different regions. Among the remaining variable groups, historical land-use, ground conditions and forest stand composition were of similar importance (5-7% unique explainable variation). Traditional management regimes resulting in semi-open forest habitats (leaf harvesting, forest grazing and selective cutting) were associated with the occurrence of many species, probably due to differences in microclimate between sites of different openness. Furthermore, a ground moisture gradient extending from species associated with dry sites (mainly lichenized fungi) to species associated with wet sites (mainly bryophytes), and a nutrient gradient from species associated with nutrient-poor sites to species occurring at nutrient-rich sites, were identified. Thus, conservation measures are needed in a broad spectrum of habitats with different substrates. Also sites with similar substrates, but situated in different regions (and climates), or with different ground moisture and nutrient conditions are needed to cover the full spectrum of habitat conditions suitable for different red-listed bryophytes and fungi.

AB  - Questions: What factors limit the distribution of epiphytic lichens and bryophytes at plot and tree level in beech forests? At what ages do epiphytic species, and species of conservation concern in particular, occur along a chronosequence of beech?
   Location: South-west Sweden.
   Method: Five hundred and seventy-one age-determined trees from 37 plots distributed among 29 beech-dominated stands were Surveyed along with a number of environmental (16) and substrate (seven) variables in a landscape of ca. 550ha. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and indicator species analysis (ISA) were used for data analysis.
   Results: Plots containing old trees, confined to the base of slopes and with low impacts of recent forestry (thinning), generally had a high richness of species of conservation concern. Richness of common species and red-listed bryophytes were mostly related to the surveyed bark area. At tree level, primary factors explaining both species richness and composition were age, diameter at breast height and moss cover. There was a gradual replacement of tree age ranges for 58 lichens and 37 bryophytes along the chronosequence of beech. Red-listed lichens favoured damaged beech trees ( >= 180 years), whereas red-listed bryophytes were found on old and young steins in dense stands.
   Conclusions: Tree age exerts a profound influence on epiphytic lichens and bryophytes growing on beech. Many of the habitat specialists were found mainly on old beech because they inhabit specific substrates that occur on older trees. The association to high tree age commonly excludes red-listed lichens from conventionally managed beech forests with a 100- to 140-year rotation period.

AB  - In northern Europe, a long history of land use has led to profound changes within forest ecosystems. The white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) is one of several specialised forest species whose populations have declined. Conservation management directed at this species' habitat has made it a de facto umbrella species for conservation of the biodiversity associated with forests rich in deciduous trees and dead wood. We assessed empirically the value of the white-backed woodpecker as an indicator and umbrella species in central Sweden. Occurrence of the woodpecker in breeding bird atlas squares (5 x 5 km(2)) indicated high species richness of forest birds, particularly species of special conservation concern, which included on average 13% more species in squares with than without the woodpecker. The number of red-listed cryptogam species expected to benefit from conservation actions directed at white-backed woodpecker habitats was higher in squares where the woodpecker bred compared to where is was absent. However, no such pattern was found for red-listed beetles, a group with very few records in the studied squares. White-backed woodpecker occurrence was positively associated with the current area of deciduous and mixed forest of high conservation value. Considering its indicator value, its specialised habitat requirements and its potential as a communication tool, using the white-backed woodpecker as an umbrella species may provide a coarse filter for the conservation of several other deciduous forest species. However, focusing solely on white-backed woodpecker habitat may not provide for the conservation of all such species, which stresses the need for a suite of complementary planning approaches.

AB  - Using data from expert assessments, we classified the habitat and resource requirements of red-listed boreal forest species in Finland. All major taxa were included and represented by 466 species. Of the four major groups studied, red-listed Plamae & Fungi and Aphyllophorales were mainly inhabitants of shady coniferous forests, whereas the habitats used by Animalia and Coleoptera were more diverse. Of the boreal tree species, Picea abies harbours the greatest number of red-listed species, but Pinus sylvestris and Populus tremula host almost as many. The proportion of critically endangered species is highest on Populus. Our results emphasise the importance of dead wood and the conservation value of natural early successional forest habitats in addition to old-growth natural forests. Red-listed forest species are a highly heterogeneous group in their habitat and resource requirements, and this has to be taken into consideration in conservation and when seeking for cost-efficient conservation measures.

AB  - It is important that measures to maintain biodiversity are taken in a way that is cost-effective for the landowner. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures that aim at increasing the substrate availability for red-listed (species that are threatened, near threatened or where species probably are threatened but data is deficient) saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) organisms. We modelled stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three regions of Sweden by using computer simulations and a database with substrate requirements of saproxylic beetles and cryptogams on the Swedish Red-List. Conclusions concerning cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures depend on the extinction thresholds of the species they are intended to conserve; measures that generate only small amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD) may provide too little substrate to be useful for species with high extinction thresholds. In northern Sweden, forestland is relatively inexpensive, so a cost-effective strategy to increase the amount of spruce CWD was to set aside more forests as reserves. In central and southern Sweden, more emphasis should instead be given to increasing the amount of CWD in the managed forest. The regulations by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) could be made more cost-effective by prescribing creation of more high stumps and retention of larger amounts of naturally dying trees. Large-sized CWD, CWD from slow-growing trees, and CWD in late decay stages are substrate types that were particularly rare in managed forest in relation to unmanaged forests. Manual soil scarification and retention of living trees are measures that can increase the proportion of these underrepresented CWD types. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the first time ever, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Index for habitat types was calculated for an entire country, Finland. The RLIs were based on species threat assessments from 2000 and 2010 and included habitat definitions for all 10,131 species of 12 organism groups. The RLIs were bootstrapped to track statistically significant changes. The RLI changes of species grouped by habitats were negative for all habitat types except for forests and rural biotopes which showed a stable trend. Trends of beetles and true bugs were positive in rural and forest habitats. Other 16 observed trends of species group and habitat combinations were negative. Several trends observed were in accordance with studies focusing on particular taxa and habitats, and drivers for their change. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the RLI as a tool for observing habitat change based on species threat assessment data.

AB  - Intensive forestry practises in the Swedish landscape have led to the loss and fragmentation of stable old-growth habitats. We investigated relationships between landscape composition at multiple scales and the composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages in nine clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth spruce-dominated forest stands in the central boreal zone of Sweden. We set out fresh spruce and birch logs and created spruce snags in 2001-2002 to experimentally test the effects of coarse woody debris (CWD) type and forest management on the composition of early and late successional, and red-listed saproxylic beetle assemblages. We examined effects of CWD availability at 100 m, and landscape composition at 1 and 10 km on saproxylic beetle abundances. Additionally, we tested whether assemblage similarity decreased with increasing distance between sites. We collected beetles from the experimental logs using eclector and window traps in four periods during 2003. CWD was measured and landscape composition data was obtained from maps of remotely sensed data. The composition of saproxylic beetles differed among different CWD substrates and between clear-cuts and the older stand types, however differences between mature managed and old-growth forests were significant only for red-listed species. Assemblage similarities for red-listed species on clear-cuts were more different at greater distances apart, indicating that they have more localised distributions. CWD availability within 100 m of the study sites was rarely important in determining the abundance of species, suggesting that early successional saproxylic beetles can disperse further than this distance. At a larger scale, a large area of suitable stand types within both 1 and 10 km resulted in greater abundances in the study sites for several common and habitat-specific species. The availability of suitable habitat at scales of 1-10 km is thus likely to be important in the survival of many saproxylic species in forestry-fragmented areas.

AB  - Forest stands are the basic planning units of managed forest landscapes, and the structural composition of these units is important for conservation of biodiversity. We present a methodological approach for identification and mapping of important structural and environmental features of forest stands. Based on an analysis of habitats of red-listed species and a synthesis of results from research on spatial distribution of forest species, we developed a habitat inventory approach (Complementary Hotspot Inventory, CHI) that is currently used in forestry planning in Norway The CHI maps fine-scale hotspots for 12 habitat types that are further classified according to positions along main environmental gradients (productivity and humidity). Consisting of different substrates in different environments, these habitats to a large degree support different species assemblages. By incorporating both the hotspot and the complementary approach, the CHI produces data tuned for later conservation measures. The high spatial resolution of data facilitates the use of conservation measures at different spatial scales, from single-tree retention to forest reserves. A validation test of habitats identified by CHI showed that the density of red-listed species was four times that of randomly selected old forests. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many polypores are specialized in their requirements for substrate and environment, and they have been suggested to indicate the continuity of coarse woody debris or naturalness of a forest stand. However, the use of polypores as indicators of conservation value is restricted by the temporally limited appearance of annual fruit bodies. We studied whether the species richness of perennial polypores (perennials) can be used to predict the species richness of annual or annual red-listed polypores (annuals). Our data included 1471 separate datasets (sample plots or larger inventoried areas) in different parts of Finland and Russian Karelia, ranging from the southern to northern boreal zone. At the large scale (the whole area) the number of perennials explained about 70% of the variation in the number of annuals, and about 67% in the number of red-listed annuals. A minimum set of 40-60 perennial occurrences gave a reliable estimate on the species richness of annuals, and 60-80 occurrences on the species richness of red-listed annuals. The richness of perennials predicted the richness of annuals and, in particular, richness of red-listed annuals, better than the size of inventoried area. According to our results, perennial polypores can be used as a surrogate for overall polypore species richness in natural and seminatural boreal forests, but the predictive power is weaker in managed forests. In addition, the relationship between the perennial and annual species seems to differ in different vegetation zones, management types and forest types. Due to this variation direct application of the indicator values derived from different vegetation zones and management or forest types are not recommended. Since perennials are easier to identify than annuals, detectable throughout the year, and have much smaller year-to-year variation, their use as an indicator group seems to offer advantages regarding the timing and cost-efficiency of inventories.

AB  - In this study we investigated hollow oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petrea) situated in open landscapes and in forests in Norway in northern Europe, and compared their importance for rare and threatened beetles (Coleoptera). Old, hollow oak trees, both in parks and in forests, were extremely rich in red-listed beetles, and hosted a high proportion of threatened species. The proportion of oak associated species and the mean number of red-listed beetle species per tree was similar in the two site types, but rarefaction showed that for a certain number of individuals, oaks in forests had more threatened and near-threatened species than oaks in parks. The species composition also differed between site types: Park oaks had a higher proportion of species associated with hollows and animal nests, whereas in forests, there was a higher proportion of species depending on dead oak wood in general. Four factors were significant in explaining the richness of red-listed beetles in our study: Tree circumference, cavity decay stage, proportion of oak in the surroundings, and coarse woody debris (CWD) in the surroundings. Forest oaks were smaller, but they still trapped a species richness comparable to that of the larger park oaks-probably a result of high amounts of CWD in the surroundings. We show that oaks in open landscapes and oaks in forest have only partly overlapping beetle assemblages and, thus, cannot be substituted in conservation. Planning for conservation of red-listed beetles associated with this key habitat demands a large scale perspective, both in space and time, as the surroundings have important effects on associated threatened and near threatened species.

AB  - Question: Herb-rich patches are biodiversity hotspots for vascular plants in boreal forests. We ask: Do species Occurrences on herb-rich patches show a non-random, nested structure?; Does patch size relate to richness of edaphically demanding and red-listed species?; Does a set of small patches support more edaphically demanding and red-listed species than a few large patches of the equal area?
   Location: Eastern Finland (63 degrees 04'N, 29 degrees 52'E), boreal vegetation zone.
   Data: Vegetation mapping of 90 herb-rich sites, varying from 0.05 to 6.93 ha in size and belonging to six different, predetermined forest site types.
   Results: Using the RANDNEST procedure, only one site type showed a significantly nested pattern, and patch area was not related to "nestedness" in any of the site types. The number of edaphically demanding and red-listed plant species was positively correlated with a patch size in three forest site types. In all site types, a set of small patches had more edaphically demanding and red-listed species than did a few large patches of the equal total area.
   Conclusions: For conservation, it is essential to protect representative sets of different herb-rich forest site types because flora varies between the site types. Within herb-rich forest site types, several small areas may support representative species composition. However, successful conservation requires thorough species inventories, because of the high level of heterogeneity between the herb-rich patches.

AB  - Some species are more likely to go extinct than others and this is partially due to species' traits. Therefore, it is important to establish links between traits and extinction risks. Different aspects of a species' biology also relates to different sources of threat, such as fragmented populations or low population growth rate. In a comparative study of Swedish longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), we related species' traits to two aspects of extinction risk - population decline and small/fragmented populations - measured by long-term population trends and IUCN Red list classifications. Trait relationships were analysed with generalized linear models and multi-model inference. We found that extinction risk generally increased with longer generation times, corresponding to slower life histories. Adult activity period was also related to both metrics of extinction risk, but in different ways. We also found that extinction risk increased with larval host plant specialization, but only for Red list classification. Large body size was related to increased Red list classification in species overwintering as adults, and overwintering stage also structured the effects of several other traits. Our results show that both intrinsic demographic traits and ecological traits affect extinction risks, and also suggest that risks are shaped by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, researchers should carefully choose their metric of extinction risk for comparative studies, as the Red list classification may best capture current risk, whereas population trends can be used more proactively but may reflect historical relationships between traits and extinction risk.

AB  - Final Palaeolithic (Terminal Palaeolithic) - the last, final phase of the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, dating from 13.5-10 kyr and has numerous paleogeographic equivalents - Dryas period, Late glacier, Late or Final glacial, Tardiglacial period, reindeer age.
   In Zhytomyr Polissia there are two main groups of different Final Palaeolithic monuments with different cultural and chronological characteristics. At the beginning of the epoch, Epigravettian mammoth hunters lived in the region. In particular, on the Ovruch ridge at the beginning of the Final Paleolithic a separate variant of the Epigravettian developed. The extinction of mammoths about 13 kyr and the onset of the reindeer era caused a change in population. During the Allerod warming about 12 kyr reindeer hunters of the Lyngby culture advanced from the South-Western Baltic region to Polissia.
   The spread of Lyngbian cultural traditions at the end of Allerod in the outwash plains from Jutland to the Neman, Prypiat, Upper Dnipro and Upper Volga laid the groundwork for the emergence 11 000 years ago areas of related cultures with arrowheads on blades. In addition to Lyngby, it includes the following cultures: Ahrensburg in Northern Germany, Swiderian in the Vistula, Prypiat and Neman basins, and Krasnosillia in the Prypiat, Neman and Upper Dnipro basins. The specificity of their flint inventory is the leading role of various tanged arrowheads on blades, while the cultural marker of Epigravettian complexes are a variety of micro-inserts with a backed edge.
   Genetically descended from the Lyngby culture population, Krasnosillian and Swiderian hunter groupes lived in the cold forest-tundra, hunting for herds of seasonally migrating reindeers. The sharp warming 10 kyr led to the migration of Krasnosillian and Swidrian groupes following the reindeer to the north of Eastern Europe, which they settled during the VIII millennium BC. On the Swiderian basis, the post-Swiderian Mesolithic was formed. It is Butovo and similar Mesolithic cultures of the forest belt of Eastern Europe from the Baltics to the Northern Ural. The Mesolithic Pisochnyi Riv culture of the Middle Desna, the Grensk culture of the Upper Dnipro, and the Ienevo culture of the Upper Volga were formed on the Krasnosillian basis. These Mesolithic communities of northern Eastern Europe in ethno-cultural terms were probably distant ancestors of the Finnish peoples.

AB  - Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of species is a prerequisite for successful species and habitat conservation. Spatial variation in breeding sites of four gull species was studied in southern Finland in an oligo-mesotrophic lake complex covering almost 50 km(2) of water areas and 290 km of shoreline in three census periods in 1986-2004. Two of the species have declined and are regarded as red-listed in Finland (black-headed gull ridibundus and lesser black-backed gull L. f. fuscus) and two have increased (common gull L. canus and herring gull L. argentatus) in numbers during the past decades. The numbers of breeding pairs and the percentage similarity in the spatial distribution of pairs of each species in grid squares were compared between different census periods at resolutions of 0.25, 1 and 4 km(2). The common gull showed very high percentage similarity between the different census periods and consequently low spatial turnover in nesting sites, whereas the red-listed species, particularly the black-headed gull, had much higher spatial turnover. The spatiotemporal dynamics of gull species should thus be taken into account in conservation planning. if site protection is based only on information of breeding gulls in one year, a large or even major proportion of the breeding red-listed gulls might be outside the protected areas after a few decades. Due to the large spatiotemporal variation of red-listed gulls, areas to be protected should cover a rather large proportion of a boreal lake, not only individual islets or islands.

AB  - It is evident that land-use decisions pose a risk to habitats, biodiversity and endangered species. However, a great challenge that decision makers and land-use managers are facing is to perform appropriate risk assessments. The challenge consist in the lack of information to build adequate models, the fact that biodiversity is not easily described in mathematical terms, and the problem of finding good endpoints. The current approach assesses the risk of loosing habitats for species included in the "Norwegian red list", by indexing information in a bayesian network. The Norwegian red list contains 3062 species encountered in Norway that are endangered either due to declining populations or simply because they are rare. By entering the current decision, region, and landscape type, the probability of loosing a habitat location for a threatened specie per affected area can be calculated. One of the two main types of information that are included in the network is the density of the threatened species depending on landscape type and region. This information could be obtained by consulting databases on reported observations of threatened species throughout the whole country. The other kind of information regards the effect on the species under the influence of different land-use decisions, based on the knowledge of habitat preferences of each species.

AB  - The "Living Forest" agreement will be of great importance for the conservation of forest biodiversity if the goals of the agreement are reached. We question whether the means are adequate for reaching these goals. The new method (NUS) developed for mapping areas and elements (e.g. logs) important for the survival of red-listed species has several unfortunate properties. Forest engineers without sufficient competence in forest ecology will be responsible for recording important forest biotopes. Therefore, only much less thantechnicalmuch greater than and easily measurable variables are recorded. Recording threatened species or indicator species is not a part of the method and will not improve our generally poor knowledge of the distribution and biology of red-listed species. The method tends to lead, to very small key biotopes (on average 0.67 ha), which leads to large edge effects and insufficient regeneration of dead wood. The "Living Forest" agreement focuses on restoration biotopes, but also this important field of forest management is omitted. Finally, the much less thanLiving Forestmuch greater than standard does not mention problems with the introduction of alien new forest tree species in Western and Northern Norway. This process indisputably leads to massive changes in ecosystems and to the eradication of species and habitats, as considerable areas of diverse deciduous forests are transformed into monoculture spruce stands every year.

AB  - To identify thresholds in the relationship between the number of species in viable populations and habitat availability is useful for nature conservation. However, to obtain such empirical data may be extremely laborious. Many saproxylic (wood-living) species are under threat because there is little coarse woody debris (CWD) in managed forests. Based on computer simulations of CWD dynamics, and information about the substrate requirements of red-listed saproxylic species, we conclude that it is unlikely that any specific quantity of CWD can be defined as the extinction threshold for large numbers of species, since different species are specialists in utilising different types of CWD. In our analysis, we identified a curvilinear relationship between total CWD and the number of red-listed species in viable populations, even assuming that there were sharp extinction thresholds for individual species. Thus, it is highly unlikely that it will ever be possible to identify simple targets for maintenance of CWD based on extinction thresholds for the whole community of saproxylic species. Instead other strategies are necessary when formulating conservation targets. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Both ash and elm are the typical tree species in several key habitats of Natura 2000 sites and accommodate a high number of associated (red-listed) species. Recent invasion of Dutch elm disease and ash dieback pathogens threatens elm and ash existence, and threatens the integrity of Natura 2000 sites. Management measures undertaken are aimed primarily at sustaining ash and elm, and associated biodiversity, and thus aimed at sustaining high nature conservation values of Natura 2000 sites.

AB  - Teachers need knowledge of species and species identification skills for teaching the structure and function of ecosystems, and the principles of biodiversity and its role in sustainability. The aim of this study is to analyze Nordic student teachers' views on the most efficient methods and strategies to teach and learn species and species identification, and to find some trends about how well their views are reflected in a species identification test. Student teachers in Finland, Norway, and Sweden (N = 426) answered a questionnaire consisting of fixed and open-ended questions, and a species identification test. An analysis of variance, Chi-Square, and t-test were used for quantitative data and an inductive content analysis for qualitative data. Results showed that outdoor teaching and learning methods are more efficient than indoor methods. The majority of student teachers considered outdoor experiential learning with living organisms as the most efficient teaching and learning method. Student teachers who highlighted outdoor experiential learning and outdoor project work as their most efficient methods received significantly better results in the species identification test than the others. Field trips and fieldwork were emphasized as the most important sources in schools and universities, while the Internet was the most important source among media. The student teachers underlined teachers' expertise in the form of in-depth understanding of subjects and supervising skills for efficient teaching both outdoors and indoors. Therefore, teaching and learning of species and species identification as the practical part of biodiversity and sustainability education is emphasized as an integral part of teacher education programs.

AB  - The availability of habitat for wood-dependent species has been greatly reduced in Fennoscandian boreal forests and hence the setting aside of forest land for conservation purposes is a common strategy. Here, we explore the biodiversity quality and conservation relevance of three categories of set-asides dominated by Norway spruce (nature reserves, woodland key habitats and retention patches, i.e. groups of living trees left on clear-cut areas) and a non set-aside forest category (old managed spruce forests) in a boreal forest region in central Sweden. The comparisons are based on surveys of (1) dead wood volumes, (2) diversity of dead wood types in terms of tree species, decomposition stage, diameter and presence of bark and (3) occurrence of saproxylic (i.e. wood dependent) beetles in Norway spruce, Picea abies. For saproxylic beetles, species richness, species composition and occurrence of red-listed species were compared. In total 180 dead wood types and 129 beetle species were found, 12 of which were red-listed. We found no significant difference between the forest categories in terms of total dead wood volume. However, the rarefied number of dead wood types was significantly greater in reserves and key habitats compared to retention patches. Woodland key habitats had significantly more beetle species than retention patches and old managed forests, as well as significantly more red-listed species than the retention patches. The species composition of retention patches, differed significantly from that of old managed forests and reserves, probably due to higher degrees of sun-exposure. We conclude that the conservation strategies explored in this study, provide valuable habitats and contribute differently to the preservation of old forests and saproxylic beetles. We would add that inventories, to identify conservation values, should be carried out prior to harvest of old stands and that measures should be taken accordingly to set-aside the parts of forest stands with the highest biodiversity values.

AB  - More than 380 species of Coleoptera have been found feeding on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Sweden. 94% of them live on dead trees. Most of them occur in the southern part of Sweden, notably in open, dry, warm pine forests on sandy and rocky ground along the Southeast coast. The reverse situation applies to the beetle fauna connected with Norwegian spruce (Picea abies) where most species are found in the northern part of the country. Some beetle species connected with dead pine have a very relict ditribution as Plegaderus sanatus gobantzi Mull., Temnochila caerulea Ol., Nacerdes carniolica Gistl, Rushia parreyssi (Muls.) and Asemum tenuicorne Kraatz on the island of Gotska Sandon in the Baltic Sea. Out of the red-listed beetles 12 live on recently dead pines, 20 species on trees that have been dead for between 3 to 20 years, 33 species on trees that have been dead between 21 and 50 years and 9 species on old dead trees that have been dead for more than 50 years. Standing dead trees as snags and stumps are the only habitat for 22 species and 6 species only use logs. The remaining species use both snags, stumps and logs of pine. Many pine stands in Sweden have been extensively influenced by forest fires until the end of the last century. Some pine living beetles strongly prefer burned trees. Certain species, such as Oxypteris acuminata (De G.), Stephanopachys linearis (Kug.) and S. substriatus (Payk.) are almost exclusively found in and under the bark of burned stems and an additional 13 red-listed species show a clear preference for burned pines. Polypores, fruitbodies as well as mycelium in dead bark and wood constitute an important food resource for many beetles. species. Seven red-listed species are linked to Fomitopsis pinicola on pine, though they can also be found on the same fungus growing on the stumps of spruce and some deciduous trees. An additional four species and two red-listed Homoptera live on Antrodia sinuosa. Eight species of Coleoptera inhabit pine stems with brown-rot, to be compared with six species living in white-rot wood mainly produced by attacks of Trichaptum abietinum. Many red-listed species on pine have decreased very rapidly during the last decades. The big longhorn beetle Tragosoma depsarium (L.) has disappeared from most areas mainly due to the lack of forest fires and the regulations in the Forestry Act concerning the amounts of fresh dead conifers. This species could also survive in windthrowns of pine, but unfortunately trees are valuable to the forest owner as well as timber or firewood. For the same reason even many of the dead or living pines which are saved for nature conservation purposes in connection with final cuts tend to "disappear" from the logged area some years later when some of them are felled by wind. Another such species is the big buprestid beetle Calcophora mariana (L.) that was earlier favoured by the use of unimpregnated railway sleepers, but for the last decades has only been found in one single, very restricted area. It is important for the survival of these and many other red-listed beetles that the few old, naturally regenerated pine stands are saved, and that we save more windthrown pines and burned pine stand for the future.

AB  - Management of ancient trees constitutes a major dilemma in the conservation of associated biodiversity. While traditional methods are often advocated, such practices may incur considerable costs and their effects have rarely been scientifically evaluated. We compared the communities of lichenized fungi, non-lichenized fungi, and bryophytes among equal number of coarse previously pollarded and unmanaged trees (n = 340). On 400 Ulmus glabra and 280 Fraxinus excelsior trees at 62 sites in Norway, we found 209 lichenized fungi, 128 non-lichenized fungi, and 115 bryophytes. Pollarded trees were richer in microhabitats than unmanaged trees and had significantly higher richness of bryophytes (ash) and non-lichenized fungi (ash and elm), the latter increasing with the availability of dead wood, cavities and coarse bark structure in pollarded trees. Further, the average total number of red-listed species, and red-listed lichenized fungi separately, were significantly higher on pollarded versus unmanaged trees, with diversity related to trunk circumference, depth of bark fissures and number of cavities. Our results underline the importance of microhabitats associated with old trees, but we cannot establish with certainty the importance of pollarding per se. Since we did not find any negative effect of canopy cover for community diversity, we assume that old trees with rich epiphytic communities can develop without management intervention. The high share (37 out of 49) of red-listed species occurring on unmanaged trees, and the fact that 11 red-listed species were found exclusively on unmanaged trees, may further indicate that unmanaged trees can with time replace the ancient pollarded trees as habitats for rich cryptogamic communities.

AB  - Long term data to estimate population trends among species are generally lacking. However, Natural History Collections (NHCs) can provide such information, but may suffer from biases due to varying sampling effort. To analyze population trends and range-abundance dynamics of Swedish longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), we used collections of 108 species stretching over 100 years. We controlled for varying sampling effort by using the total number of database records as a reference for non-red-listed species. Because the general frequency of red-listed species increased over time, a separate estimate of sampling effort was used for that group. We observed large interspecific variation in population changes, from declines of 60% to several hundred percent increases. Most species showed stable or increasing ranges, whereas few seemed to decline in range. Among increasing species, rare species seemed to expand their range more than common species did, but this pattern was not observed in declining species. Historically, rare species did not seem to be at larger risk of local extinction, and population declines were mostly due to lower population density and not loss of sub-populations. We also evaluated the species' declines under IUCN red-list criterion A, and four currently not red-listed species meet the suggested threshold for Near Threatened (NT). The results also suggested that species' declines may be overlooked if estimated only from changes in species range. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riparian forests are biodiversity hotspots and key habitats for forest conservation, yet it is not known if the protection of these habitats also provides protection for stream organisms. We used data from 50 headwater stream-forest systems in northern Finland to address this question. Our study sites formed a gradient from highly modified (by forestry) to old-growth riparian forests. We assessed whether the community structure and diversity of benthic diatoms, aquatic bryophytes, stream macroinvertebrates and red-listed species (bryophytes + invertebrates) responded to riparian habitat alteration and whether habitat classification based on site naturalness is indicative of stream conservation value. Except for diatoms and chironomid larvae, all taxonomic groups studied, as well as red-listed species, responded negatively to site modification, showing peak diversity in unmodified habitats. Also in terms of community composition, most aquatic groups responded to the gradient of site naturalness. These results suggest that woodland key habitats, although initially targeted at the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity, may prove to be valuable for the protection of stream biodiversity as well, extending their potential importance to regional biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Fire is increasingly used in management and restoration of forest ecosystems, in order to rehabilitate habitat structure and to create habitats for species dependent on forest fires and dead wood. However, information on the impacts of fire on saproxylic species is scanty, and long-term studies on the effects are almost totally lacking. Here we present results from a long-term field study conducted in eastern Finland in 1988-2011. Two pine-dominated boreal forest stands, a seminatural and a managed one, were intentionally burnt in 1989. We inventoried polypores 1 year before the fire, in the year of burning, and 1, 2, 6, 13 and 22 years after the fire. The short-term effects of fire were destructive for polypore communities. However, species numbers recovered to the pre-fire level 6 years after the fire. After 13 years, the number of species was clearly higher than before the fire, due to the large input of fire-killed dead trees. The number of red-listed species was strikingly high (18 species) in the seminatural stand 13 years after the fire including several species which have earlier been considered as old-growth forest indicators, and remained at high level (17 species) still 22 years after the fire. The number of red-listed species was much lower in the formerly managed stand (6 and 8 species, respectively). We conclude that burning of stands can be a very effective method to create habitats for red-listed polypore species, at least if the stand is located close to high-quality source areas and contains a sufficient amount of large-diameter trunks of different tree species.

AB  - 1. Crunoecia irrorata is widely dispersed across Europe, but rare and red-listed in Finland. Its geographical range comprises most of the southern boreal zone in Fennoscandia. The species is confined to springs in the north, but occurs also in lower reaches of headwater streams in central and western Europe. It becomes more rare and less abundant towards the limits of its range across Europe, showing diffusive rarity. Glacial history and climate limit the distribution of the species in the north.
   2. The most important habitat characteristic for C. irrorata in Finland was the total area of helocrene habitats. Its occurrence was positively related to taxon richness of benthic macroinvertebrates, but not bryophytes. Co-occurrence of C. irrorata with other red-listed spring-dependent taxa was observed, indicating high conservation value of the springs occupied.
   3. Crunoecia irrorata occurred frequently in moderately disturbed springs, indicating tolerance to human disturbance around springs. However, the effect of the disturbance on population size is not known. Forestry and water and gravel extraction are potential threats to C. irrorata, and only a few of its populations are strictly protected. Therefore, populations of C. irrorata in the boreal zone should be conserved and monitored to ensure the species' survival at the northern limits of its range.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) data may play an important role in the development of cost-effective means for modelling, mapping, planning and conserving biodiversity. Specifically, at the landscape scale, spatial models for the occurrences of species of conservation concern may be improved by the inclusion of RS-based predictors, to help managers to better meet different conservation challenges. In this study, we examine whether predicted distributions of 28 red-listed plant species in north-eastern Finland at the resolution of 25 ha are improved when advanced RS-variables are included as unclassified continuous predictor variables, in addition to more commonly used climate and topography variables. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we studied whether the spatial predictions of the distribution of red-listed plant species in boreal landscapes are improved by incorporating advanced RS (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index and Tasseled Cap transformations) information into species-environment models. Models were fitted using three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) climate-topography only; (2) remote sensing only; and (3) combined climate-topography and remote sensing variables, and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation with the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The inclusion of RS variables improved both the explanatory power (on average 8.1 % improvement) and cross-validation performance (2.5 %) of the models. Hybrid models produced ecologically more reliable distribution maps than models using only climate-topography variables, especially for mire and shore species. In conclusion, Landsat ETM+ data integrated with climate and topographical information has the potential to improve biodiversity and rarity assessments in northern landscapes, especially in predictive studies covering extensive and remote areas.

AB  - Species-specific densities of saproxylic beetles in cut 4-m high, medium to large diameter stumps of spruce, birch, aspen and oak were monitored for 7 years after cutting, by trapping emerging insects within seasonally applied net enclosures. A total of 47,038 individuals, representing 316 saproxylic beetle species including 40 red-listed species, were recorded. Densities of 86 species were modelled in relation to stump diameter and measured levels of sun-exposure. Two thirds of the species favoured semi- or fully exposed substrates, while one third performed better in shade. Few species seemed to be specifically adapted to semi-exposed conditions. Diameter was generally of less importance than exposure, and similar numbers of species favoured medium and large diameter substrates. Group mean diameter and exposure calculated from means per individual and species were similar for groups of modelled and non-modelled species, and for groups of red-listed and non-red-listed species, respectively. This indicates that the proportions found in the models are representative for the diverse regional fauna of saproxylic beetles that utilise high stumps of spruce, birch, aspen and oak in early stages of decay. The results suggest that sun-exposed dead wood substrates generated and retained in managed forest landscapes are potentially important for many species. However, stands of unmanaged self-thinning successions of deciduous trees, as well as substantial areas of old-growth spruce-forests are also necessary to address the wide spectrum of saproxylic beetles.

AB  - Artificially created high-stumps (snags) are created regularly during forest felling operations in Swedish coniferous production forests. The saproxylic beetle fauna in high-stumps of spruce and birch, on 20 clearcuts in Southern Sweden, were sampled by bark sieving. Ten of the clearcuts were located in hotspot areas with documented occurrence of many red-listed saproxylic beetle species. The other ten clearcuts were located in a typical production forest landscape (i.e. the matrix). Our aim was to investigate whether the benefit of creating high-stumps differs if the clearcuts is located in a hotspot area or in the matrix. In total 4,179 saproxylic beetles were found, belonging to 66 species, 9 of which were red-listed. Birch high-stumps hosted more species, on average, than spruce high-stumps. In an ordination analysis, tree species had the strongest explanatory effect among the environmental variables. No difference in beetle fauna could be found between the hotspot and matrix clearcuts, for neither birch nor spruce, according to all parameters: species numbers, species composition and red-listed species. The study does not indicate that conservation efforts in coniferous production forests should be concentrated to hotspot areas.

AB  - Historically, wildfires have played an important role in forest dynamics in Fennoscandia. In Finland, the annually burned area has diminished in recent decades. This has led to a decline of fire-adapted habitat types and species, many of which have become red-listed. In Fennoscandia, there is a long tradition of silvicultural burnings to enhance tree regeneration. Recently, prescribed burnings have been modified for biodiversity goals following the recommendations that have emerged from ecological research. Prominent biodiversity gains can be obtained by combining sufficient retention levels with burnings. Consequently, burning and retention have been recommended by recent national red-list assessments, strategies, and forest-management guidelines, and they have been adopted in forest-certification standards in Finland. Contrary to these recommendations, the opposite development has taken place: (1) the ecological efficiency of the criterion concerning prescribed burning in the PEFC forestcertification standard has been impaired, (2) state funding to encourage private forest owners to apply prescribed burning was reduced significantly, and (3) prescribed burnings have been abandoned altogether in commercial state-owned forests. Traditional burnings with variable retention have also been partially replaced with burning of small retention-tree groups. This new method is less risky and cheaper, but its ecological benefits are questionable because small-sized fires produce much smaller areas of burned forest soil with less fire-affected wood than traditional silvicultural burnings. Generally, the widely accepted goal to increase burnings with retention appears difficult to achieve and would require stronger political will and economic support from the government. We identified several actions that could improve the weakened situation of fire-dependent biodiversity and recommend the following: (1) setting a clear goal and ensuring sufficient funding for the burnings-including restoration burnings in conservation areas-and targeting these to specific fire-continuum areas with sufficient retention to ensure the continuity of fire-affected habitats at landscape level; (2) renewing the current subsidizing policies to encourage private landowners to perform prescribed burnings in regeneration areas after final fellings, and to safeguard accidental forest-fire areas as set-asides; (3) renewing the current prescribed-burning criterion of the Finnish PEFC forest-certification standard with more ambitious ecological goals; and (4) re-introducing prescribed burnings in commercial state forests where management targets are under political steering.

AB  - In Fennoscandia, the concept of woodland key habitats has become one of the key concepts when defining hotspots for forest biodiversity. There is a serious lack of studies, however, in which the diversity value of the assumed key habitats has been assessed for any groups of organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the woodland key habitats as defined in the Finnish Forest Act can be advocated as diversity hotspots for polypores, a group of wood-decaying fungi including several red-listed species and species used as indicators for conservation value of forests. The study area was situated in the southern boreal zone, in eastern Finland. In total, 72 woodland key habitat sites representing six different habitat types, and 12 production forest sites as controls were investigated for their polypore assemblages. A total of 2077 records of 93 species was made, of which only 17 records of nine species were red-listed. On average, key habitats hosted more species than control forests, but of the six habitat types, only fresh and mesic-moist herb-rich forests differed significantly in species number from the control forests. Compared with control forests, key habitats can maintain rich polypore flora but, because of the low number of red-listed species found, they are likely to be of little help in the conservation of threatened polypores.

AB  - Aim The aims of this work were (1) to study how well land-cover and climatic data are capable of explaining distribution patterns of ten bird species breeding and/or feeding primarily on marshes and other wetlands and (2) to compare the differences between red-listed and common marshland species in explanatory variables, and to study the predictability of their distribution patterns.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods The data of the bird atlas survey carried out in 1986-89 using a 10 x 10 km uniform grid system in Finland were used in the analyses. Land-cover data based on CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) classification and climatic variables were compiled using the same 10 x 10 km grid. Generalized additive models (GAM) with a stepwise selection procedure were used to select relevant explanatory variables and to examine the complexity of the response shapes of the different species to each variable. The original data set was randomly divided into model training (70%) and model evaluation (30%) sets. The final models of common and red-listed bird species richness were validated by fitting them to the model evaluation set, and the correlation between observed and predicted species richness was calculated. We assessed the discrimination ability of the binary models (single species) with the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and the Kappa coefficient.
   Results Cover of marshland, shoreline length and mean temperature in April-June were significantly (P < 0.01) related to the common marshland species richness. Cover and clumping of marshland and mean temperature and precipitation in April-June were selected in the model of red-listed marshland species richness. The level of discrimination in our single species models varied in ROC from fair to excellent (AUC values 0.70-0.95). Cover of marshland was included in all GAM models built for the target species, but clumping of marshland, shoreline length and cover of mires also appeared as important predictors in single species models. Seven species had statistically significant relationships with climatic variables in the multivariate GAMs. Cover of marshland was highest in squares in which the red-listed bittern Botaurus stellaris, marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus and great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus and the water rail Rallus aquaticus were observed.
   Main conclusions Cover of marshland was the only variable which was included in all the models, reinforcing the close connection between the studied species and marshlands. Broad-scale clumping of marshlands was important for the red-listed species, probably due to the much lower population sizes of red-listed species than those of common species. Land-cover data produced in CORINE seems to be well suited for modelling the distribution patterns of marshland birds. Although climatic variables also strongly affect the studied marshland birds, habitat availability plays a crucial role in their occurrence. The distribution patterns of marshland birds at the scale of 10 x 10 km reflect the interplay between habitat availability and direct climatic variables.

AB  - Conservation strategies are often established without consideration of the impact of climate change. However, this impact is expected to threaten species and ecosystem persistence and to have dramatic effects towards the end of the 21st century. Landscape suitability for species under climate change is determined by several interacting factors including dispersal and human land use. Designing effective conservation strategies at regional scales to improve landscape suitability requires measuring the vulnerabilities of specific regions to climate change and determining their conservation capacities. Although methods for defining vulnerability categories are available, methods for doing this in a systematic, cost-effective way have not been identified. Here, we use an ecosystem model to define the potential resilience of the Finnish forest landscape by relating its current conservation capacity to its vulnerability to climate change. In applying this framework, we take into account the responses to climate change of a broad range of red-listed species with different niche requirements. This framework allowed us to identify four categories in which representation in the landscape varies among three IPCC emission scenarios (B1, low; A1B, intermediate; A2, high emissions): (i) susceptible (B1=24.7%, A1B=26.4%, A2=26.2%), the most intact forest landscapes vulnerable to climate change, requiring management for heterogeneity and resilience; (ii) resilient (B1=2.2%, A1B=0.5%, A2=0.6%), intact areas with low vulnerability that represent potential climate refugia and require conservation capacity maintenance; (iii) resistant (B1=6.7%, A1B=0.8%, A2=1.1%), landscapes with low current conservation capacity and low vulnerability that are suitable for restoration projects; (iv) sensitive (B1=66.4%, A1B=72.3%, A2=72.0%), low conservation capacity landscapes that are vulnerable and for which alternative conservation measures are required depending on the intensity of climate change. Our results indicate that the Finnish landscape is likely to be dominated by a very high proportion of sensitive and susceptible forest patches, thereby increasing uncertainty for landscape managers in the choice of conservation strategies.

AB  - Herbivores are often drivers of ecosystem states and dynamics and in many situations are managed either as livestock or through controlled or exploitative hunting of wild populations. Changes in herbivore density can affect the composition of plant communities. Management of herbivore densities could therefore be regulated to benefit plant species of conservation concern. In this study we use a unique spatial dataset of large herbivores in Norway to test whether herbivore density affects the distribution of rare red-listed plant species in tundra ecosystems, and to identify regions where herbivore density is the most important factor in determining the habitat suitability for the plant species. For all selected species a climatic variable was the most important determinant of the distribution, but herbivore density was an important determinant of some species notably Primula scandinavica. Herbivore density was the most important factor determining habitat suitability for this species in 13% of mainland Norway. Regions of Norway where the management of herbivore densities is most strongly linked to the habitat suitability of red-listed plant species are mapped. However, there was very low concordance in the localities of these areas; at any individual locality, habitat suitability was limited by herbivore density for only a small subset of the species. This suggests that management of herbivores for the benefit of rare plant species needs to be tailored for individual locations or species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban forests are often remnants of former larger forested areas, and traditionally considered as degraded habitats due to negative effects of urbanization. However, recent studies have shown that urban forests managed for recreational purposes can be structurally close to natural forests and may provide habitat features, such as dead wood, that are scarce in intensively managed forest landscapes. In this study, we assessed how urbanization affects polypore species richness and the number of red-listed polypore species in forest stands, and the occurrences of polypore species on individual units of dead wood. Spruce-inhabiting polypore assemblages and their associations to urbanization, local habitat connectivity and dead-wood abundance were investigated in southern Finland. The effects of urbanization on polypore species richness and individual species were largely negligible when other environmental variability was accounted for. Several red-listed polypore species were found in deadwood hotspots of urban forests, though urbanization had a marginally significant negative effect on their richness. The main driver of total species richness was dead-wood abundance while the number of red-listed species was also strongly dependent on local habitat connectivity, implying that a high degree of fragmentation can decrease their occurrence in urban forests. We conclude that the highest potential for providing habitats for threatened species in the urban context lies in large peri-urban recreational forests which have been preserved for recreational purposes around many cities. On the other hand, overall polypore diversity can be increased simply by increasing dead-wood abundance, irrespective of landscape context.

AB  - Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrate taxa due to anthropogenic habitat change and emerging pathogens. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) may cause trade-offs between the immune responses and other important functions, such as mobility. The pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae) is red-listed in Sweden, and an earlier study conducted in our study area did not detect the fungus. In this study, 67 Swedish pool frogs were tested for Bd. Of these, 28 adults were provided with external radio transmitters and tracked during the summer and autumn to compare movement among infected and non-infected individuals. Additionally, we tested some individuals for Bd twice during the summer to study intra-seasonal variation in individual infections. Our results suggest that Bd has recently invaded these pool frog populations. During autumn, movement distances of infected pool frogs were shorter compared to uninfected individuals, and summer movements within ponds were reduced by increasing Bd load. We also found that the frogs can clear (or reduce) Bd infection during their active season. The results from this study increase understanding of the implications of Bd infections in an anuran fringe population, as well as in amphibian metapopulations, and can further guide amphibian conservation planning and management.

AB  - The tourism industry is rapidly growing, and the massification of certain areas is jeopardising the environment. Certain roads in protected areas or near tourist attractions are experiencing an increase in traffic volumes, leading to higher pollution and noise levels and greater discomfort in the travel experience. To recommend measures intended to ensure a sustainable tourism industry without compromising the environment, it is necessary to obtain further knowledge regarding tourists' travel behaviour as it may differ from that of other travellers, i.e., tourists might choose a route based on variables other than time and cost, such as landscape or tourist attractions.
   Using Geiranger Fjord in Norway as a case study, tourist route choice preferences were observed and analysed. In total, 60 routes from 12 different origins were observed based on 408 responses collected through a tourist survey administered in the summer of 2018. These data were combined with information regarding road features and the locations of tourist attractions. A path size correction logit model was selected to estimate the significant variables in the choice of one route over other routes. The results showed that tourists selected their routes mainly based on the travel time, road scenery (water bodies and forests), sightseeing places among first-time visitors, and outdoor activities among those living outside of Norway. In addition, the tourists preferred local roads, and 'caravan' tourists were more attracted to roads with fewer facilities. The findings of this study show that tourists' route choice behaviour differs from that of other travellers. Policymakers should consider these differences to enhance transport systems. Further research should focus on incorporating these findings into a transport model to simulate tourists' travel patterns and quantify changes in traffic volumes due to different sustainable measures.

AB  - Retention forestry and prescribed burning aim to alleviate the negative effects of forestry on biodiversity by maintaining the structural elements of natural forests in managed forests. We present the long-term effects of these methods on polypore fungi, a taxonomic group that has been severely affected by forestry. Using a 10-year, large-scale field experiment, we studied how prescribed burning and two different tree retention levels (10 and 50m(3)ha(-1)) affect polypore fungi. We monitored polypore sporocarps on 2767 individually marked trees four times over the study period: in the first autumn after the treatments, and again 2, 4 and 10years after the treatments. The number of polypore species and records initially increased rather slowly but showed a marked increasing trend towards the end of the 10-year monitoring period. After 2years, the higher retention sites had an average 85 species and the low retention sites 45 species per site. After 4years, the difference was 14 vs. 9 species and after 10years 26 vs. 19 species. Red-listed species were not found often on the trunks earlier than 10years after the treatments. Prescribed burning increased the number of polypore species and records along with time. Furthermore, 13 species favoured burned sites, while only six species favoured unburned sites, and the differences in the composition of species assemblages between burned and unburned sites were evident 10years after the treatments.Synthesis and applications. We show, for the first time, that retention trees can host rich polypore assemblages, and even some red-listed species, and, thus, be useful in conservation of forest biodiversity outside protected areas. Higher retention levels maintain more diverse polypore assemblages. Prescribed burning increases the positive effects of retention forestry by creating substrates that are typical in the early-successional natural forests.

AB  - To effectively preserve the threatened fauna of old-growth forest it is important to identify species that are adversely affected by forest management. We focused on insect species Living in fruiting bodies of two polypore species and compared their frequency between forests sites differing in terms of the continuity with which their breeding substrate (dead wood) was available (long, short or no continuity). The polypore species studied were Fomitopsis pinicola and Fomes fomentarius, in which the patterns of occurrence were determined for 25 and 27 insect species, respectively. Species showing significantly higher frequency in less managed forests were Oplocephala haemorrhoidalis (Tenebrionidae), Cis quadridens (Cisidae), and Scardia boletella (Tineidae). Some less frequent species showed similar, but non-significant, trends. We suggest that polypore-inhabiting species restricted to sites with a long, continuous supply of dead wood might be used as indicators of sites of high conservation value. Their presence might also be indicative of species. of high conservation value in other dead-wood microhabitats with similar temporal and spatial dynamics. The species that we found to be restricted to less managed forests are all included on the Swedish red-list. However, two species not affected by management are also red-listed, Showing that numbers of red-listed species must be used with caution as a measure of conservation value.

AB  - Why populations of threatened species disappear is among the key questions in conservation biology. However, very few local and regional studies have attempted to quantify the importance of the various causes. In this investigation, the status of the populations of threatened vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens found between the years 1860-1979 in a national biodiversity hot spot in SW Finland was studied during the years 1990-2008. Of the populations, 82% had disappeared and 18% were re-discovered. The disappearance rate of populations differed between habitats: exceeding 80% in most habitat types whilst being lowest on rock outcrops (58%). Complete destruction of all locally suitable habitats was the main reason for the disappearance of the populations (73%) concerned. Habitat deterioration (including partial habitat loss) was identified as the reason for the disappearance for 22% of the populations. Only for 5% of the populations could it not be revealed whether habitat quality had changed or not, but deterioration of habitat quality or habitat loss is possible even in these cases. For none of the disappeared populations was no change in habitat quality verified. In most cases, habitat loss and deterioration were caused by agriculture or forestry. These results support the conclusion that vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen populations in the boreal landscape have disappeared directly because their habitats have disappeared, declined in size or deteriorated due to forestry, agriculture, construction, mining and pollution. More subtle changes in habitat quality, fragmentation, problems related to small population size per se and other reasons may have contributed to only a few disappearances of local populations. The disappearance rate was similar between the study groups, but the relative importance of reasons for disappearance was different. The results emphasize the importance of habitat protection for threatened vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. (C) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dry grasslands on calcareous bedrock in warm climates around the Oslo Fjord are naturally fragmented biodiversity hotspots. This habitat geographically coincides with the most densely populated area of Norway. Many habitat specialists, along with the habitat itself, are red-listed because of land-use change, forest encroachment, and invasive species that cause habitat loss and greater isolation of remaining patches. To ensure effective conservation, data on species presences and absences are necessary to quantify states, changes, and extinction risks in specific populations and habitat patches. New information We present presence-absence data of 49 vascular plant species in 15 patches of dry calcareous grassland habitat, surveyed in 2009, 2019, and in 2020. The species are considered to be habitat specialists and, thus, unlikely to occur between the patches.

AB  - Saproxylic beetles constitute a significant proportion of boreal forest biodiversity. However, the long history of timber production in Fennoscandia has significantly reduced the availability of dead wood and is considered a threat to the conservation of saproxylic beetle assemblages. Therefore, since the mid-1990s dead wood retention in harvested stands has formed an integral part of silvicultural practices. However, the contribution of this biodiversity-orientated management approach to conserving saproxylic beetle assemblages in boreal forest landscapes that include production forestry remains largely untested. We examined differences in resident saproxylic beetle assemblages among stands under different management in a boreal forest landscape in Central Sweden, and in particular stands managed according to new conservation-orientated practices. We also investigated the relationship between beetle diversity and forest stand characteristics. Bark of coarse woody debris (CWD) was sieved for beetles in old managed stands, unmanaged nature reserves, and set-aside areas, and clear-cut stands harvested according to certification guidelines [new forestry (NF) clear-cuts]. All stand types contributed significantly to the total diversity of beetles found. While stand size, position, and distance to nearest reserve were unimportant, both the quality and the quantity of CWD in stands contributed significantly to explaining beetle abundance and species richness. This extends the previous findings for red-listed invertebrates, and shows that heterogeneous substrate quality and a range of management practices are necessary to maintain saproxylic beetle diversity in boreal forest landscapes that include production forestry. The unique abiotic conditions in combination with the abundant and varied CWD associated with NF clear-cuts form an important component of forest stand heterogeneity for saproxylic beetles. It is thus essential that sufficient, diverse, CWD is retained in managed boreal landscapes to ensure the conservation of boreal saproxylic beetle assemblages.

AB  - Timber harvesting, and especially clear-cutting followed by soil scarification, has altered boreal forest ecosystems in important ways. For example, loss of decaying wood in many parts of boreal forests has reduced habitats for saproxylic species. Several methods have recently been introduced, however, to reduce the negative impacts of forestry on the natural biota. Use of controlled burning and green-tree retention in restoration and management of forests is growing rapidly, especially in Fennoscandia, but the effects of these measures on forest biota remain hypothetical. We performed a large-scale field experiment to study impacts of burning and green-tree retention on beetles in the Scots pine dominated forests of Eastern Finland. The factorial study design included a total of 24 sites (3-5 ha each), with three tree retention levels (0, 10 and 50 m(3)/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned. Each treatment combination was replicated three times. Beetles were sampled with window traps before and after the treatments in 2000 and 2001 to study short-term impacts of treatments on beetle assemblages. The data consisted of 34,175 beetle individuals, representing 740 species. The assemblages were greatly affected by the treatments, especially on the burned sites, while on the unburned sites higher tree retention level maintained assemblages closer to the pre-treatment structure. In general, the number of species increased with harvesting and burning. Burning had a significant effect on number of red-listed species, whereas harvesting intensity affected saproxylic, non-saproxylic and red-listed species. The numbers of individuals of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased more on the burned than on the unburned sites. The results show that living conditions of many declined forest species, in particular saproxylics, can be enhanced in commercial forests by increasing the number of retained trees and by controlled burning. At least close to source areas not only strictly pyrophilous species but also many other rare and threatened species seem to be able to locate new resources quite effectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rare beetle Elater ferrugineus was sampled at 47 sites in the county of Ostergotland, Sweden by means of pheromone-baited traps to assess its value as an indicator species for hollow oak stands rich in rare saproxylic beetle species. In addition, Osmoderma eremita was also sampled with pheromone baits. These data were then compared against species survey data collected at the same sites by pitfall and window traps. Both species co-occur with many Red Listed saproxylic beetles, with E. ferrugineus being a some-what better indicator for the rarest species. The conservation value of a site (measured as Red List points or number of Red Listed species) increased with the number of specimens of E. ferrugineus and O. eremita caught. Accuracy of sampling by means of pheromone trapping turned out to be radically different for the two model species. E. ferrugineus traps put out during July obtained full accuracy after only 6 days, whereas O. eremita traps needed to be out from early July to mid-August in order to obtain full accuracy with one trap per site. By using E. ferrugineus, or preferably both species, as indicator species, accuracy would increase and costs decrease for saproxylic biodiversity sampling, monitoring and identification of hotspots.

AB  - Prescribed burning after clear-cut is a traditional silvicultural method used for promoting regeneration of new tree cohort, but it also affects biodiversity of the harvested sites. We studied, on sites dominated by Pinus sylvestris with Picea abies admixture, how burning of clear-cuts affects wood-decaying fungi on stumps and slash left on sites. In total, 18 sites, nine of which were burned, were studied in a large-scale field experiment in eastern Finland. Polypore fungi were surveyed 10 years after the bumings. In total, we sampled 13,083 stumps and 12,023 pieces of slash and counted 6,598 polypore records of 54 species.
   Burned stumps hosted more polypores than unburned stumps, but burning had no effect on polypores on slash. Both stumps and slash hosted also some red-listed polypore species - more so, if the resource was burned. The results show that stumps and slash can be valuable substrates for wood-decaying fungi, including rare and red-listed species. We recommend avoiding full-scale, intensive stump and slash harvest e.g. for bioenergy, and to apply prescribed burnings on harvested sites, to enhance polypore diversity in managed forests.

AB  - The cover and extent of boreal broadleaved forests have been decreasing due to modern forest management practices and fire suppression. As decomposers of woody material, polypores are ecologically important ecosystem engineers. The ecology and conservation biology of polypores have been studied intensively in boreal coniferous forests. However, only a few studies have focused on the species living on broadleaved trees. To increase knowledge on this species group we conducted polypore surveys in 27 broadleaved forests and 303 forest compartments (539 ha) on the southern boreal zone in Finland and measured dead wood and forest characteristics. We detected altogether 98 polypore species, of which 13 are red-listed in Finland. 60% of the recorded species are primarily associated with broadleaved trees. The number of species in a local community present in a broadleaved forest covered approximately 50 species, of which 30-40 were primarily associated with broadleaved trees. The size of the inventoried area explained 67% of the variation in the species richness, but unlike in previous studies conducted in coniferous forests, dead wood variables as well as forest structure had very limited power in explaining polypore species richness on forest stand level. The compartments occupied by red listed Protomerulius caryae had an especially high volume of living birch, but otherwise the occurrences of red-listed species could not be predicted based on the forest structure.

AB  - Intensive forest management in Scandinavia has decreased the amount of dead wood required by saproxylic (wood-living) organisms. To reduce this problem, some dead wood is now retained during forest operations, often in the form of man-made high stumps (ca. 4 m high). Most often these stumps are cut with a harvester, although the stumps in this study were made with explosives. The aims of this study were to determine whether such stumps of aspen (Populus tremula) and birch (Betula spp.) could be used by red-listed saproxylic beetles (Coleoptera), and to examine how the fauna of man-made high stumps differs from that of natural stumps. We also studied how tree species, sun-exposure, stage of decay and trunk diameter influenced the fauna. In 169 samples of bark from high stumps 116 saproxylic species were found, of which 21 were red-listed. Many species, including red-listed ones, were more associated with man-made stumps than with natural stumps. However, in total, more species were found in the natural than in the man-made stumps. This is probably because man-made stumps provide a more homogeneous type of wood substrate than natural ones. Among the other variables the difference between aspen and birch was the most important. We conclude that man-made high stumps are valuable habitats for many saproxylic beetle species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Economically-oriented forestry aims to sustain timber harvest revenues, while ecologically-oriented management supplies suitable habitat for species using deadwood as primary habitat. As these objectives are conflicting, planning for economic and ecological sustainability involves compromise and trade-offs. We analyze the spatial trade-offs between the economic value from timber harvesting and the volume of deadwood in the boreal forest. We assess these trade-offs from three perspectives: (1) landscape characteristics, affected by conservation stra-tegies; (2) forest management promoting either economic or ecological values; (3) uncertainty in inventory errors undermining the estimate of the two sustainability objectives. To reveal the tradeoffs between the forest economic and ecological values we simulated and optimized a production landscape in Finland 30 years into the future accounting for uncertainty in biomass and deadwood inventories. We found that, with a limited reduction in timber harvesting (7%), (i) the amount of deadwood increased more in non-aggregated (45%) than in aggregated (16%) stands, (ii) constraining stands in adjacent areas further increased deadwood (21%) respect to the matrix and (iii) 7% of connected stand area harbored >= 20 m3/ha deadwood supporting survival of near-threatened species. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the landscape for biodiversity can be improved with limited economic losses. However, improving habitat configuration requires larger economic losses than only increasing habitat amount, but its ecological benefits are larger both for common and red-listed species. We found that management oriented towards stand aggregation not only creates connected areas with high deadwood of high value biodiversity but also improves the value of the whole matrix by decreasing intensive timber harvesting and energy wood collection. Finally, we found that uncertainties alter the estimate of the potential of the forest landscape to supply deadwood, and this can affect the choice of management actions to allocate over the landscape. To conclude, our results demonstrate the trade-offs between economic forest use and conservation are affected differently by landscape characteristics, forest management and uncertainty in in-ventory errors. As such these drivers should be considered when optimizing the forest for multiple uses.

AB  - We sampled the wood beetle fauna in 1) living hollow, 2) standing dead and 3) downed dead beech Fagus sylvatica logs in fragmented old-growth forests in southern Sweden. In nearly primaeval stands, species richness was similar in the three types of microhabitat, but in previously (50-100 yr ago) managed stands species richness was lower in living hollow trees. The number of red-listed beetle species per sample was higher in living hollow beeches in nearly primaeval stands than in formerly managed stands, but there was no difference in downed dead beeches. This agrees with our expectation, based on the relative stability of the microhabitats, that species living in hollow trees would have a lower dispersal propensity than those that depend on dead, downed logs. Among 55 red-listed species found, 69% had a higher frequency in nearly primaeval stands than in previously managed stands. For 22 endangered plus vulnerable species the figure was 77%. Most red-listed species had occurrence frequencies of 5%, or less.

AB  - Negative impacts of forestry on biodiversity have been addressed through environmental considerations held within legislation and various forest certification protocols. We used Sweden as a case study where a long history of forestry aiming at sustained yield of wood fiber has resulted in landscapes with low quantities of old growth structures e.g. dead wood and old forest, but where environmental considerations have been implemented during the last two decades. We reviewed the scientific literature for studies evaluating the environmental considerations included in the Swedish Forestry Act and FSC, compared individual metrics and benchmarks, identified thresholds as well as identified specific gaps missing from current regulations (missing factors/areas of improvement). All environmental considerations listed in the Swedish Forestry Act were found to be relevant for conservation. The strongest scientific support for their importance in maintaining biodiversity in managed landscapes was found for dead wood, tree retention and habitats for sensitive species, including edge zones and woodland key habitats. However, suggested levels fall below identified thresholds. Retention of small habitat patches can provide a lifeboat function for some red-listed species, but the long term survival of these populations is uncertain. Tree species composition was also found be important, and in the boreal region the proportion of deciduous trees is a key factor. For some environmental considerations, there is too limited information from the scientific literature to evaluate their importance in relation to the current levels, e.g. consequences of clear-cut size and shape, and forest roads. Similarly, damage to soil and water affect biodiversity through drainage, leakage and sedimentation, but the effects vary considerably and are often diffuse. There is a need to better adjust the levels of environmental considerations above thresholds from empirical studies. However, it will be impossible within current regulatory framework to maintain all species in all landscapes. Therefore, the allocation of environmental consideration among stands, landscapes and regions need to be considered. Evenly dispersed retention might always stay below suggested thresholds with limited contribution to ecologically sustainable forest ecosystems. More flexibility, where the sum of conservation measures in the landscape as opposed to measures in individual stands are considered, would result in better conservation strategies. This would mean that particular landscapes could be more intensively managed and in other more focus on biodiversity conservation could be taken. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emulation of natural disturbances in harvesting has become a widely accepted approach to reach ecologically sustainable forest management. The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of polypore fungi (species richness and composition) on four different cutting methods (selection, gap, patch, and clear-cutting) plus uncut controls, and the creation of high stumps and cut logs in combination with harvesting. Polypores were inventoried one year before, and two and seven years after cutting. A total of 71 polypore species were found, but no red-listed species were recorded seven years after cutting. Irrespective of the treatment, the variation in polypore richness was best explained by the number of deadwood objects in the stands. Species richness per deadwood object was the highest on natural logs. Species richness per volume of spruce deadwood was the highest on small-diameter deadwood and stumps, intermediate on natural logs and lower on cut logs and high stumps. These results indicate that cut logs created in harvesting cannot compensate the loss of deadwood in cutting and energy wood harvesting. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in rapidly creating habitats for red-listed polypores in commercially managed forests.

AB  - The successful implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will rely on effective translation of targets from global to national level and increased engagement across diverse sectors of society. Species conservation targets require policy support measures that can be applied to a diversity of taxonomic groups, that link action targets to outcome goals, and that can be applied to both global and national data sets to account for national context, which the species threat abatement and restoration (STAR) metric does. To test the flexibility of STAR, we applied the metric to vascular plants listed on national red lists of Brazil, Norway, and South Africa. The STAR metric uses data on species' extinction risk, distributions, and threats, which we obtained from national red lists to quantify the contribution that threat abatement and habitat restoration activities could make to reducing species' extinction risk. Across all 3 countries, the greatest opportunity for reducing plant species' extinction risk was from abating threats from agricultural activities, which could reduce species' extinction risk by 54% in Norway, 36% in South Africa, and 29% in Brazil. Species extinction risk could be reduced by a further 21% in South Africa by abating threats from invasive species and by 21% in Brazil by abating threats from urban expansion. Even with different approaches to red-listing among countries, the STAR metric yielded informative results that identified where the greatest conservation gains could be made for species through threat-abatement and restoration activities. Quantifiably linking local taxonomic coverage and data collection to global processes with STAR would allow national target setting to align with global targets and enable state and nonstate actors to measure and report on their potential contributions to species conservation.

AB  - The question whether forest fuel extraction will affect biodiversity is ultimately a question of whether there will be species extinctions due to this practice. Quantitative predictions i.e. about how much habitat loss various species can tolerate, therefore require knowledge about processes that work over hundreds of square kilometres and over several years. Therefore, they are almost impossible to make. Instead, qualitative recommendations about which types of habitats or wood types that have the most threatened fauna and flora can be made based on information about landscape history and microhabitat associations of red-listed species. For Sweden a general conclusion for forest fuel extraction based mainly on saproxylic beetles is that coniferous wood can be harvested as forest fuel to a rather large extent, whereas deciduous tree species, and especially southern deciduous species and aspen, should be retained to a larger degree.

AB  - The main paradigm for protection of biodiversity, focusing on maintaining or restoring conditions where humans leave no or little impact, risks overlooking anthropogenic landscapes harboring a rich native biodiversity. An example is northern European agricultural landscapes with traditionally managed semi-natural grasslands harboring an exceptional local richness of many taxa, such as plants, fungi and insects. During the last century these grasslands have declined by more than 95%, i.e. in the same magnitude as other, internationally more recognized declines of natural habitats. In this study, data from the Swedish Red List was used to calculate tentative extinction rates for vascular plants, insects (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera) and fungi, given a scenario where such landscapes would vanish. Conservative estimates suggest that abandonment of traditional management in these landscapes would result in elevated extinction rates in all these taxa, between two and three orders of magnitude higher than global background extinction rates. It is suggested that the species richness in these landscapes reflects a species pool from Pleistocene herbivore-structured environments, which, after the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, was rescued by the introduction of pre-historic agriculture. Maintaining traditionally managed agricultural landscapes is of paramount importance to prevent species loss. There is no inherent conflict between preservation of anthropogenic landscapes and remaining 'wild' areas, but valuating also anthropogenic landscapes is essential for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - ContextLoss and fragmentation of semi-natural grasslands has critically affected many butterfly species in Europe. Habitat area and isolation can have strong effects on the local biodiversity but species may also be strongly affected by the surrounding matrix.ObjectivesWe explored how different land cover types in the landscape explained the occurrence of butterfly species in semi-natural grasslands.MethodsUsing data from 476 semi-natural grasslands in Sweden, we analysed the effect of matrix composition on species richness and occurrence. Additionally, we analysed at which spatial scales butterflies responded to matrix types (forests, semi-natural grasslands, arable land and water).ResultsForest cover showed the strongest positive effect on species richness, followed by semi-natural grasslands. Forest also had a positive effect on red-listed species at local scales. Responses to matrix composition were highly species-specific. The majority of the 30most common species showed strong positive responses to the amount of forest cover within 200-500m. There was a smaller group of species showing a positive response to arable land cover within 500-2000m. Thirteen species showed positive responses to the amount of semi-natural grasslands, generally at larger scales (10-30km).ConclusionsOur study showed that surrounding forest is beneficial for many grassland butterfly species and that forests might mitigate the negative effects of habitat loss caused by agricultural intensification. Also, semi-natural grasslands were an important factor for species richness at larger spatial scales, indicating that a landscape consisting mainly of supporting habitats (i.e. forests) are insufficient to sustain a rich butterfly fauna.

AB  - The ongoing loss of red-listed coastal heathlands is a threat to biodiversity and cultural heritage legacies throughout the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. 'passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce.

AB  - Intensive management of boreal forests has replaced natural disturbances, leading to losses of residual deadwood and saproxylic biodiversity. Declining population sizes have been well documented for insect groups such as bark and wood-boring beetles, whilst other groups such as flat bugs (Heteroptera: Aradidae) are less well-studied and little is known about their response to forest restoration. We conducted two restoration experiments addressing this lack of knowledge. We predicted the following responses to restoration: (1) artificial gap-creation and prescribed burning will attract more flat bugs than control stands, (2) increasing pre-burning fuel loads will have a positive influence on flat bug response to fire restoration. To test these predictions we conducted two field experiments; in Sweden we compared prescribed burning of standing forest with artificial gap-creation and in Finland we compared differing levels of fuel-load prior to burning. We found partial support for our first prediction, total numbers of flat bugs collected was higher in burned forest stands compared to controls in both countries. By contrast, gap-cutting only resulted in a marginal increase in the numbers and species of flat bugs collected. We found no support for our second hypothesis. The red-listed Aradus angularis and A. laeviusculus were primarily found in burned stands. Aradus betulae, A. betulinus and A. lugubris were more frequent in burned stands than gap-cuttings and untreated controls. Our study therefore suggests that ecological restoration, especially burning, is an efficient way of attracting flat bugs to suitable habitat, we therefore recommend ecological restoration to be incorporated in boreal forest management.

AB  - Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs), which are biologically and culturally valuable habitats maintained by low-intensity grazing and mowing, are a core element of biodiversity in Europe. During the last decades, TRBs have faced severe habitat loss and fragmentation due to agricultural modernization. Despite their well-known critical state, their conservation remains inadequate, thus raising a need to advance TRB conservation via spatial land-use planning. In this study we analyze a national GIS database on TRBs in order to examine how the current TRB network can be complemented in terms of conservation value based on known ecological characteristics. Given different target scenarios for the amount of managed TRBs, we demonstrate where management should be directed to both on protected and unprotected areas. We conclude that in current state, biodiversity depending on TRB management is not efficiently sustained in Finland. Substantial amount of TRB habitats and populations of threatened TRB species are left unmanaged. Based on our results, we suggest that to advance TRB conservation in Finland, the cover of managed TRBs should be rapidly extended to form ecologically functional networks. The expansion would prioritize additional management to the Baltic Sea coast and smaller clusters within inland Finland, double the cover of managed TRBs, and direct management subsidies in a more cost-effective way.

AB  - We surveyed the quantity and quality of dead Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees and wood-inhabiting cryptogams in a managed boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. Size and decay of dead trees was related to substrate utilization by wood-inhabiting species. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was surveyed along 34 strip transects. CWD and wood-inhabiting cryptogams were surveyed in eight circular plots at each site. A total of 6195 spruce CWD units occurred along strip transects and 809 spruce CWD units in circular plots. On average 2.2 m(3)/ha spruce CWD was found on the plots. The majority (63%) of the transect CWD units were <10 cm diameter and in early to intermediate decay stages. Sixty-eight wood-specific species of fungi, lichens, mosses, and hepatics occurred on the plots. Of these, 13 occurred on greater than or equal to 5% of the 809 CWD units surveyed for wood-inhabiting species. Eight species occur on the Swedish red lists, indicating that such species are indeed uncommon in managed forests. Red-listed species showed strong preferences for large diameter CWD and CWD in late decay stages, i.e., substrates that are poorly represented in managed forests. Frequently occurring species, however showed utilization patterns that correspond with the distribution of the substrate types.

AB  - (1) We document the invertebrate fauna collected from 24 oak canopies in east and west Norway as a contribution to the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre's 'The Norwegian Taxonomy Initiative'. (2) A snap-shot inventory of the canopies was recorded by means of emitting a mist of natural pyrethrum into the canopies at night using a petrol-driven fogger and collecting the specimens in butterfly nets spread on the ground under the canopy. (3) Almost the entire catch of more than 6800 specimens was identified to 722 species. Out of 92 species new to the Norwegian fauna, 21 were new to science and, additionally, 15 were new to the Nordic fauna. Diptera alone constituted nearly half of the species represented, with 61 new records (18 new species). Additionally, 24 Hymenoptera (one new species), six oribatid mites (two new species) and one Thysanoptera were new to the Norwegian fauna. (4) Our study emphasizes the importance of the oak tree as a habitat both for a specific fauna and occasional visitors, and it demonstrates that the canopy fogging technique is an efficient way to find the 'hidden fauna' of Norwegian forests. The low number of red listed species found reflects how poor the Norwegian insect fauna is still studied. Moreover, the implication of the IUCN red list criteria for newly described or newly observed species is discussed.

AB  - Understanding what determines wildlife species richness and community composition in urban green spaces is important for wildlife management and urban planning. Numerous studies have assessed the relationships between attributes of urban green spaces (size, vegetation, isolation, urbanization) and bird species richness, but little is known about how these factors influence community composition. I censused breeding land birds in 93 urban green spaces in Oslo, Norway, and species were grouped according to ecology (habitat preference, nest site, migration, diet, and red-list status). I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city.

AB  - Decline in the amount of coarse woody debris is a major factor resulting in habitat deterioration for saproxylic organisms in forests. This study assessed the effects of forest restoration (increasing the amount of decaying wood) on dead wood and wood-decaying fungi. The data were collected from Norway spruce and Scots pine dominated forest stands in Finland that had been used for timber production until they were set aside as reserves. Dead trees and polypore fungi were inventoried five years after restoration and compared with control forests. Altogether, 50 polypore species were found from the study area. Restoration clearly increased the amount of dead wood (11.5 vs. 1.1 m(3)/site) as well as the average number of common polypores (6.6 vs. 2.9 species/site) but no threatened species were found. Variation in the dead wood types (decay stages) was low in the restored sites which probably hinders the occurrence of rare species. Thus, our results suggest that restoring dead wood does not immediately benefit the populations of red-listed and rare polypores, although restoration clearly alters the fungal assemblages. A longer time span is needed until the restored substrates become suitable for most red-listed species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current clear-cutting forestry practices affect many boreal organisms negatively, and those dependent on dead wood (saproxylics) are considered as particularly vulnerable. The succession of species assemblages in managed forest habitats regenerating after clear-cutting is, however, poorly known. We compared beetle assemblages in three successional stages of managed boreal spruce forests established after clear-cutting and two types of older spruce forests that had not been clear-cut. We also assessed whether saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetle assemblages show similar biodiversity patterns among these forest types. Beetles were collected in window traps in nine study areas, each encompassing a protected old-growth forest (mean forest age similar to 160 years, mean dead wood volume 34 m(3)/ha), an unprotected mature forest (similar to 120 years old, 15 m(3)/ha), a middle-aged commercially thinned forest (53 years old, 3 m(3)/ha), a young unthinned forest (30 years old, 4 m(3)/ha), and a clearcut (5-7 years after harvest, 11 m(3)/ha). Saproxylic beetles, in particular red-listed species, were more abundant and more species rich in older forest types, whereas no significant differences among forest types in these variables were detected for non-saproxylics. The saproxylic assemblages were clearly differentiated; with increasing forest age, assemblage compositions gradually became more similar to those of protected old-growth forests, but the assemblage composition in thinned forests could not be statistically distinguished from those of the two oldest forest types. Many saproxylic beetles adapted to late-successional stages were present in thinned middle-aged forests but absent from younger unthinned forests. In contrast, non-saproxylics were generally more evenly distributed among the five forest types, and the assemblages were mainly differentiated between clearcuts and forested habitats. The saproxylic beetle assemblages of unprotected mature forests were very similar to those of protected old-growth forests. This indicates a relatively high conservation value of mature boreal forests currently subjected to clear-cutting and raises the question of whether future mature forests will have the same qualities. Our results suggest a high beetle conservation potential of developing managed forests, provided that sufficient amounts and qualities of dead wood are made available (e.g., during thinning operations). Confirming studies of beetle reproduction in dead wood introduced during thinning are, however, lacking.

AB  - Changes in the structure and composition of 123000 ha of boreal forests in Sweden, were analysed using historical records. These forests had not been commercially logged when the first forest surveys took place in the late 1800s, so the earliest surveys provide unique data on structure of the natural boreal forest. The pre-exploitation forests had many large-diameter living and standing dead trees (Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and were dominated by stands >200 years old. Commercial exploitation in the late 1800s, subsequent intensive forest management and fire protection have generated a forest landscape dominated by relatively young and dense stands, totally different from the pre-exploitation forests. Since the late 1800s, both the number of large trees and the volume of snags have been reduced by about 90%, and the area of old stands has diminished to <1%. These fundamental changes have reduced the number of habitats for many red-listed species considerably. We conclude that the essential characteristics of the natural forest landscape have to be re-created in order to restore and maintain natural biodiversity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Green-tree retention is a relatively new forestry application, which aims at decreasing the negative effects of clear-cut logging on forest biodiversity. In this study, the value of retained aspens in maintaining diverse assemblages of wood-decaying fungi (polypores; Basidiomycota) on clear-cuts was investigated, after the retention trees had died, fallen and started to decay. A total of 110 fallen aspen trunks were investigated on clear-cuts and within old-growth forests in eastern Finland, southern boreal zone; and 499 records of polypores belonging to 46 species were made. The intermediately decayed trunks on a clear-cut area hosted more species and more red-listed species than did trunks within forests. Most of the polypore species with more than two records were found in both habitats. These results suggest that many aspen-associated polypores are able to live and reproduce in sun-exposed habitats, if the quality and quantity of dead wood fulfill the species-specific requirements. This unexpected result, however, may be partly due to the exceptionally great abundance of aspen in the study area. Furthermore, in the long term, the local benefits of fallen retention trees can be limited, unless the local continuity of large aspens, both living and dead, is ensured.

AB  - This study evaluates how the placement and the different possible outcomes of a spruce retention tree affected species richness and assemblages of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles. In a field experiment in the boreal zone of central Norway, high stumps were created and compared with residual wood pieces (i.e. top boles with branches), in clear-cuts versus in forest edges. Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge. To cater for the variety of habitat preferences among forest beetles in managed forest, managers should leave both standing spruce trees (many of which will end up as windthrown, downed holes) and some high stumps (to secure some upright dead wood), in both exposed clear-cut and semi-shaded forest edge.

AB  - Scientists have deemed existing protected areas in European forests insufficient to halt and reverse biodiversity loss resulting from ongoing intensification of management. In Sweden, protected areas are therefore complemented with the so-called areas of high conservation value (AHCVs), that is, landscapes encompassing both protected and assumed biodiversity-valuable areas as well as surrounding land, where managers should pay increased attention to biodiversity. However, it is not known whether AHCVs are chosen so that the species they are intended to benefit inhabit such AHCVs to a higher degree. We investigated whether the occurrence and abundance of bird species that may be particularly vulnerable to intense forest management were higher in Swedish forest landscapes proposed as AHCVs compared with other forest landscapes. To this end, we fitted a joint species distribution model to bird count data for 70 forest bird species from a standardized Swedish bird monitoring scheme. Twelve of the 20 forest specialists (60%) were detected to occur more often inside AHCVs than outside, whereas no forest specialist was less likely to occur inside AHCVs. For forest generalists, the corresponding figures were 28% and 18%, respectively. Six of 15 red-listed species (40%) were detectably more likely to occur inside AHCVs. The relationship between AHCV status of landscapes and the abundance of individual species was not as consistently negative or positive. The higher occurrence of specialists and threatened species inside AHCVs than outside of them suggests that if managed correctly, AHCVs are important habitat for a considerable part of the specialized forest avifauna in Sweden. We conclude that AHCVs represent an opportunity for designing green infrastructure benefitting Swedish forest biodiversity.

AB  - In Sweden, old wooden barns often host a diverse and threatened lichen flora including eight red-listed species, but this kind of barn has declined over the past 100 years. The barns have traditionally been made out of Pinus sylvestris, and it could be hypothesized that pine snags are the natural habitat for many lichens occurring on anthropogenic wood. We compared the lichen flora on old wooden barns in the village C of Gardsjo, Dalarna with that on snags of P. sylvestris. At alpha level, both species richness and lichen abundance were highest on snags, and for both substrates the north aspects had more species and higher abundance than E, S and W aspects. Overall species richness was similar on the substrates, with a slight tendency for higher gamma-level diversity on barns. NMS ordination showed clear compositional differences between barns and snags, and also indicated a more heterogeneous vegetation on barns. Implications for conservation measures are discussed.

AB  - Knowledge of the distribution of rare species is crucial for species conservation in fragmented habitats. Species communities often exhibit nestedness, i.e. species in species-poor sites comprise a subset of richer ones. Thus, rare species are confined to species-rich sites. We evaluate whether plant and fungal communities in 46 old-growth spruce forest patches (0.17-12 ha) exhibit nestedness. The question whether a single large patch or several small patches capture most species (i.e. the SLOSS-issue) is evaluated in combination with species saturation analyses. All species groups exhibited significant nestedness. Area was generally related to nestedness, i.e. rare species were over-represented in the largest patches. Species saturation analysis indicated that large patches accumulated more Red-list species in patch interiors than small patches. Thus, rare and Red-list species were best captured in large patches. However, nestedness also emerged in equal sized sample plots, i.e. rare species were over-represented in high quality habitats. Thus, small habitats of high quality should not be neglected in a conservation perspective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The occurrence of Chara connivens (Charophyta, Characeae) and its status in the Baltic Sea may raise contro-versies regarding its origin and historical dispersal pathways in the area. This study critically revises the pro-tection status of C. connivens in the countries around the Baltic Sea, as well as its status on the red lists of endangered plant species (including the HELCOM Red List). The first reports on the presence of C. connivens in the Baltic Sea area were published in the aftermath of Carl Baenitz's talks given in the early 1870s. Already then, the scientific community was well aware of the fact that C. connivens had been introduced as a ballast plant to the known Baltic areas of occurrence - the first known record of the species is from 1829. Since Poland is the only country where C. connivens is protected, the historical and contemporary distribution of this charophyte in the Polish coastal waters is presented against the background of the available historical and recent records of the species in the Baltic Sea. Recent reports from the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century have confirmed a fairly common occurrence of C. connivens in Estonia, Sweden and Poland. This species still occurs on the German coast and has also been reported from Finland (the angstrom land archipelago). In recent decades, however, the species was considered rare in the Baltic Sea area. In Poland, C. connivens was even classified as extinct, despite earlier data on its occurrence in the Vistula Lagoon in the 1970s, where it was rediscovered in 2011. It was also found in the Szczecin Lagoon a year later. Both localities well suit Luther's pattern of C. connivens occurrence in areas with intensive shipping and ballast discharge operations in historical times. Based on this in-depth revision of historical and current distribution, it is postulated that C. connivens, as non-indigenous, should not be red-listed in the Baltic Sea area, following the example of Finland. Moreover, its legal status in Poland of a strictly protected species should be reconsidered.

AB  - The importance of the landscape surrounding a protected area for sustaining its values is frequently discussed in conservation literature. Studies on the interactions of urbanisation and nature conservation at the global scale suggest that protected nature attracts urbanisation, and that this in turn might negatively impact the area. However, studies specifically addressing such land use dynamics at city scale are largely missing. In this study we examine the change in proportion of built up area in two zones (500 m and 1000 m) surrounding 15 urban nature reserves in southern Sweden. By using comprehensive maps from the last 50 years, we compared the zones to the overall urbanisation in the cities to reveal discrepancies in land use surrounding the nature reserves. We found that the amount of built up area in the buffer zones surrounding nature reserves followed the same trend as the corresponding cities and this relation was stable over time, although the positive relationship was not significant. The establishment of nature reserves had no detectable effect on surrounding land use, however two distinguished groups of reserves were identified with either more or less built up area in buffers zones compared to cities. These differences were related to specific local drivers such as land ownership, land use history and nature reserve location. In contrast to earlier studies at global scale, our study did not show that nature reserves attract urbanisation. Instead, we stress that the great variety of contextual factors at the city scale makes quantitative analysis of this kind extremely difficult. However, a general neglect from planning and nature conservation agencies to recognise nature reserves' dependence on the surrounding landscape configuration could be detrimental to sustain their values in the long-term. Hence we suggest that zones surrounding nature-protected areas should be planned and managed according to local land use history and current landscape conditions to enable and enhance necessary cross-boundary interactions.

AB  - Larger carabid beetle species linked to open habitats have exhibited recent rapid decline in numbers throughout Europe. For example, Carabus arcensis is on the Danish Red List. Ability of C. arcensis to disperse across non-habitable barriers in an island-mainland landscape has been evaluated through investigation of its population structure across Kattegat strait with special emphasis on the oceanic island LaesO. Based on admixture and statistical phylogenetic analyses of genome-wide SNPs, data for C. arcensis comprising 3195 SNPs in 87 individuals from nine sample sites, three major lineages and six populations were found within the study area. These are the first genome-wide SNPs data generated for carabid beetles. Contrary to predicted, water stretches did not seem to affect dispersal of C. arcensis to the island of LaesO, as isolation by distance plot showed no differences between sites connected by land and sites separated by an oceanic water gap. Unexpected high genetic diversity of the C. arcensis population on LaesO island has been observed calling for future research and explanation. High conservation priority in Denmark is suggested for smaller islands like LaesO.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most threatened habitats in the world, and so are their species, which suffer habitat loss due to climate and land use changes. Freshwater species, and especially arthropods, receive comparatively little attention in conservation plans, and the goals to stop and reverse the destruction of wetlands published 25 years ago in a manifesto by the Union of Concerned Scientists have not been reached. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and habitat requirements at two spatial scales of two species of European fishing spiders Dolomedes, which rely heavily on declining wetland habitats in Sweden and southern Norway. We collected occurrence data for Dolomedes plantarius and Dolomedes fimbriatus, using a live-determination method. We modelled the placement of nursery webs to describe fine-scale habitat requirements related to vegetation and micro-climate. Using a machine learning approach, we described the habitat features for each species and for co-occurrence sites, thus providing insight into variables relevant for the presence and detectability of Dolomedes. Nursery placement is mostly dependent on proximity to water, presence of Carex sp. (Sedges) and crossing vegetation structures, and on humidity, while detection can be affected by weather conditions. Furthermore, co-occurrence sites were more similar to D. plantarius sites than to D. fimbriatus sites, whereby surrounding forest, water type and velocity, elevation and latitude were of importance for explaining which species of Dolomedes was present. Overall, habitat requirements were narrower for D. plantarius compared to D. fimbiratus.

AB  - To halt the loss of biodiversity, serious conservation measures are needed. Recently, key habitat approach has been adopted in all Nordic and Baltic countries. In Finland, conservation of Forest Act Habitats (FAHs) is the main instrument. We assessed whether FAHs have the potential to conserve the unique bryoflora of springs by studying 58 spring complexes, 8 of which included a predetermined FAH. FAHs had more pool surface and colder water than other springs. Our results suggest that a clear bias towards protecting certain types of springs exists, and that a significant number of FAHs have not yet been found. Moreover, our species data did not support the assumption that FAHs are of special importance: richness of bryophytes, specialists or red-listed species were not higher in FAHs. We conclude that the high demand of naturalness and the bias towards aesthetically appealing springs can lead to an ecologically crippled network of protected areas.

AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to biodiversity declines. However, studies assessing effects of urban landscapes per se (i.e., disentangled from focal habitat effects) on biodiversity across spatial scales are lacking. Understanding such scale-dependent effects is fundamental to preserve habitats along an urbanization gradient in a way that maximizes overall biodiversity. We investigated the impact of landscape urbanization on communities of woodland-breeding bird species in individual (local scale) and across multiple (regional scale) cities, while controlling for the quality of sampled habitats (woodlands). We conducted bird point counts and habitat quality mapping of trees, dead wood, and shrubs in 459 woodlands along an urban to rural urbanization gradient in 32 cities in Sweden. Responses to urbanization were measured as local and regional total diversity (gamma), average site diversity (alpha), and diversity between sites (beta). We also assessed effects on individual species and to what extent dissimilarities in species composition along the urbanization gradient were driven by species nestedness or turnover. We found that landscape urbanization had a negative impact on gamma-, alpha-, and beta-diversity irrespective of spatial scale, both regarding all woodland-breeding species and red-listed species. At the regional scale, dissimilarities in species composition between urbanization levels were due to nestedness, that is, species were lost with increased landscape urbanization without being replaced. In contrast, dissimilarities at the local scale were mostly due to species turnover. Because there was no difference in habitat quality among woodlands across the urbanization gradient, we conclude that landscape urbanization as such systematically causes poorer and more homogeneous bird communities in adjacent natural habitats. However, the high local turnover and the fact that several species benefited from urbanization demonstrates that natural habitats along the entire urbanization gradient are needed to maintain maximally diverse local bird communities.

AB  - In production forests, a common silvicultural objective is enhancing tree growth rates. The growth rate influences both mechanical and biochemical properties of wood, which may have an impact on dead wood inhabiting (i.e. saproxylic) species. In this study, we tested for the first time whether tree growth rates affect dead-wood associated assemblages in general and the occurrence of red-listed species in particular. We sampled saproxylic beetles (eclector traps) and fungi (DNA metabarcoding of wood samples) in dead trunks of Norway spruce (Picea abies), which had different growth rates within the same hemiboreal forests in Sweden. A high proportion of fungi showed a positive association to increasing tree growth. This resulted in higher fungal richness in fast-grown trees both at the trunk scale and across multiple studied trunks. Such patterns were not observed for saproxylic beetles. However, a set of species (both beetles and fungi) preferred slow-grown wood. Moreover, the total number of red-listed species was highest in slow-grown trunks. We conclude that dead wood from slow-grown trees hosts relatively fewer saproxylic species, but a part of these may be vulnerable to production forestry. It implies that slow-grown trees should be a target in nature conservation. However, where slow-grown trees are absent, for instance in forests managed for a high biomass production, increasing the volumes of dead wood from fast-grown trees may support many species.

AB  - With steadily shrinking areas of species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe, the management of the remaining fragments becomes ever more crucial for the preservation of key elements of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Detailed knowledge about species-wise, as well as group-wise, relationships can provide guidelines for conservation management and a basis for predictions about different management scenarios. In the present study, we related the occurrence of species of bumblebees (N = 12), butterflies (31) and day-flying moths (4) and their total richness in 424 sites in southern Sweden to three grass sward attributes, (i) flower abundance, (ii) height of the grass sward and (iii) within-site variation in height of vegetation. The abundance of nectar-bearing flowers proved overall the best predictor of richness and in most of the occurrence-based species-wise models. However, both high grass sward height and high variation in grass sward height contributed significantly to species richness and occurrence of individual species. There was a tendency for bumblebees to respond less positively to flower abundance and vegetation height than butterflies and moths. One expectation was that grassland specialists, red-listed species, or species decreasing in other part of Europe, would be more responsive to tall vegetation or flower abundance but there was no support for this in the data. Hence, management strategies that promote common species will also benefit all, or most of, the rare ones as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Swedish forest and environmental policies imply that forests should be managed so that all naturally occurring species are maintained in viable populations. This requires maintenance of functional networks of representative natural forest and cultural woodland habitats. We first review the policy implementation process regarding protected areas in Sweden 1991-2010, how ecological knowledge was used to formulate interim short-term and strategic long-term biodiversity conservation goals, and the development of a hierarchical spatial planning approach. Second, we present data about the amount of formally protected and voluntarily set aside forest stands, and evaluate how much remains in terms of additional forest protection, conservation management and habitat restoration to achieve forest and environmental policy objectives in the long-term. Third, a case study in central Sweden was made to estimate the functionality of old Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous forest habitats, as well as cultural woodland, in different forest regions. Finally, we assess operational biodiversity conservation planning processes. We conclude that Swedish policy pronouncements capture the contemporary knowledge about biodiversity and conservation planning well. However, the existing area of protected and set-aside forests is presently too small and with too poor connectivity. To bridge this gap, spatial planning, management and restoration of habitat, as well as collaboration among forest and conservation planners need to be improved.

AB  - Changing silvicultural methods to improve habitat quality for forest organisms has become one of the main means to preserve forest biodiversity in Fennoscandia. In boreal forests, coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important substrate for red-listed species. In this study, we analyse cost-efficiency of five management measures taken in Swedish forestry. which aim at increasing CWD in managed forests: retention of living trees at harvest, artificial creation of high stumps, manual scarification at clear-cuts to avoid destruction of CWD, prolongation of the rotation period, and retention of naturally dying trees. For Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in different parts of Sweden, we calculated the present value and predicted the amount of CWD that will be present if the same management method is used over a long time. To retain reasonable amounts of naturally dying trees was always inexpensive, and in central and northern Sweden it was more economical to retain them than to harvest them. Creation of high stumps was a cost-efficient method to increase the amount of CWD. Prolonging the rotation period was the most expensive way to increase CWD. We conclude that adopting several different measures to increase CWD in managed forests, as prescribed by certification standards today, is a good concept. but to be cost-efficient the focus should he on different measures for different parts of Sweden.

AB  - Reliable assessment measures are crucial for tracking changes in biodiversity and for evaluating the state of biodiversity. Two of the main drivers of biodiversity are habitat heterogeneity and resource amount. These drivers are used as proxies of biodiversity but assessing both is costly, limiting their practical use. To test which of the drivers best predicts the number and abundance of sessile species of conservation concern (including macrofungi, lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants), we assessed forest stand heterogeneity using a method developed in Sweden ('Habitat Heterogeneity Score HHS'), and quantified the resource amount and quality of ecologically important structural variables (deadwood volume, basal area of living trees, proportion of broadleaved trees, and the age of the oldest tree in the stand). We conducted the assessments in 77 boreal coniferdominated forest stands in two regions of Sweden. Despite some group-specific organism differences, HHS was the best predictor of both number and abundance of all species of conservation concern, regardless of the region. Further, HHS was the best predictor of red-listed species number and abundance in the southern region, while a model including the volume of deadwood and the age of the oldest tree performed best in the northern region. Deadwood (CWD) volume was the single best resource amount predictor of the number and abundance of species of conservation concern, emphasizing the critical role that dead trees have for biodiversity. In addition, we calculated threshold values for deadwood volume and HHS depicting the level above which the number of red-listed species is significantly higher, and found this value to be higher in the southern region (22.4 m(3) ha(-1) deadwood and a HSS value of 17) than in the north (20.0 m(3) ha(-1) and 16). These values can be used as guidance when identifying coniferous forests with high enough qualities to support red-listed species. To conclude, the method of assessing habitat heterogeneity presented in this study is a practical and reliable way to identify forests of high biological diversity, and can therefore be part of the toolbox for sustainable forestry in boreal forests.

AB  - Estimating trends of populations distributed across wide areas is important for conservation and management of animals. Surveys in the form of annually repeated counts across a number of sites are used in many monitoring programmes, and from these, nonlinear trends may be estimated using generalized additive models (GAM). I use generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) to decompose population change into a long-term, smooth, trend component and a component for short-term fluctuations. The long-term population trend is modelled as a smooth function of time and short-term fluctuations as temporal random effects. The methods are applied to analyse trends in goldcrest and greenfinch populations in Sweden using data from the Swedish Breeding Bird Survey. I use simulations to investigate statistical properties of the model. The model separates short-term fluctuations from longer term population change. Depending on the amount of noise in the population fluctuations, estimated long-term trends can differ markedly from estimates based on standard GAMs. For the goldcrest with wide among-year fluctuations, trends estimated with GAMs suggest that the population has in recent years recovered from a decline. When filtering out, short-term fluctuations analyses suggest that the population has been in steady decline since the beginning of the survey. Simulations suggest that trend estimation using the GAMM model reduces spurious detection of long-term population change found with estimates from a GAM model, but gives similar mean square errors. The simulations therefore suggest that the GAMM model, which decomposes population change, estimates uncertainty of long-term trends more accurately at little cost in detecting them.Policy implications. Filtering out short-term fluctuations in the estimation of long-term smooth trends using temporal random effects in a generalized additive mixed model provides more robust inference about the long-term trends compared to when such random effects are not used. This can have profound effects on management decisions, as illustrated in an example for goldcrest in the Swedish breeding bird survey. In the example, if temporal random effects were not used, red listing would be highly influenced by the specific year in which it was done. When temporal random effects are used, red listing is stable over time. The methods are available in an R-package, poptrend.

AB  - In contrast to many other gull species, nominate lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus fuscus, nLBBG) have shown generally decreasing population trends throughout their breeding area in northern and eastern Fennoscandia over the past decades and are now red-listed. Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

AB  - Globally, intensive forestry has led to habitat degradation and fragmentation of the forest landscape. Taking Sweden as an example, this development is contradictory to international commitments, EU obligations, and to the fulfillment of the Parliament's environmental quality objective "Living Forests", which according to Naturvardsverket (The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) will not be achieved in 2020 as stipulated. One important reason for the implementation deficit is the fragmented forestry management. In a forest landscape, felling and other measures are conducted at different times on separate forest stands (often relatively small units) by different operators. Consequently, the authorities take case by case decisions on felling restrictions for conservation purposes. In contrast, conservation biology research indicates a need for a broad geographical and strategical approach in order to, in good time, select the most appropriate habitats for conservation and to provide for a functioning connectivity between different habitats. In line with the EU Commission, we argue that landscape forestry planning could be a useful instrument to achieve ecological functionality in a large area. Landscape planning may also contribute to the fulfilment of Sweden's climate and energy policy, by indicating forest areas with insignificant conservation values, where intensive forestry may be performed for biomass production etc. Forest owners should be involved in the planning and would, under certain circumstances, be entitled to compensation. As state resources for providing compensation are scarce, an alternative could be to introduce a tax-fund system within the forestry sector. Such a system may open for voluntary agreements between forest owners for the protection of habitats within a large area.

AB  - P> Much of ecological research focuses on the responses of species and species communities to variation in the amount and quality of resources that are required for survival and reproduction. In such research, it is critical to measure the availability of resources in a manner that is relevant in relation to the ecological requirements of the species.
   We have developed a measure for resource availability that integrates the contributions of the number, volume and diversity of resource units to quantify the amount of habitat that is available for a species community. We apply this measure to data on the occurrence of 116 species of wood-decaying polyporous fungi in 47 study plots of boreal forest within an area of 150 x 150 km.
   We show that species richness and pooled abundance of common species is explained well by the number of downed logs, whereas the occurrence of 41 red-listed species is best explained by the total volume of logs and by the abundance of large logs in particular. The occurrence of common species is explained by the local availability of dead wood, whereas the occurrence of red-listed species is additionally affected by the spatial connectivity of the focal forest stand to the surrounding larger expanses of old-growth forest.
   Our results elicit the contrasting ecologies of common and red-listed species in relation to how the number of logs, their size distribution and diversity, and forest connectivity affect species occurrences. The results suggest that the most cost-effective means of preventing further declines of threatened species is to increase the amount of large downed logs through restoration and biodiversity-oriented management in the vicinity of existing areas of natural-like forests.
   Synthesis. Our results illustrate that the most relevant way of measuring resource availability can differ greatly even within a taxonomically coherent community seemingly sharing the same resources. Our approach for modelling resource availability applies to the resources that occur as discrete objects with variation in the size and quality of individual resource units.

AB  - Scandinavian alpine vascular plants are red-listed (R-L) according to criteria defined by IUCN. These are based on an evaluation of their risk for extinction in the future, which for most alpine plants have been related to possible effects of climate change. In the present study, ecological characteristics of R-L alpine plants are inferred from their occurrence in previously studied alpine plant communities. In total, data on 231 communities were compiled from studies in Norway and Sweden, and a total of 39 red-listed vascular plants were found in 142 of them. The data were analysed by numerical analyses in order to assess if and how communities with and without R-L species differ in terms of floristic composition and environmental conditions. The analysies show that most of the R-L plants are situated at the ends of the main floristic gradients extracted by Detrended Correspondense Analysis (DCA). These extremes are interpreted to represent high-altitudinal communities with long-lasting snow cover. In productive communities dominated with herbs and ferns, R-L plants are few or missing. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated that the R-L species form a heterogeneous group both in terms of ecology, abundance, and geographic distribution. Some of the communities were considered to be especially valuable because they included several (up to eight) R-L plants. Such communities are found in the upper part of the middle alpine or high alpine zone (460-675 m above the forest limit) and on calcareous substrate. It may generally be assumed that alpine plants with optima at the edges of the floristic gradients may be especially vulnerable to climate changes.

AB  - Question
   Which environmental and historical variables affect epiphytic lichen diversity in managed and unmanaged wooded meadows?
   Location
   The island of Gotland located in the Baltic Sea east of the Swedish mainland.
   Methods
   We examined total epiphytic lichen diversity (crustose, foliose and fruticose species) on 1148 trees in eight grazed, eight traditionally managed (mowing, hay gathering and pollarding) and seven unmanaged wooded meadows. In addition to management, data on site location, habitat structure, history and adjacent habitat were analysed.
   Results
   Lichen species richness increased with wooded meadow area and was greater within managed sites than in unmanaged meadows. Historic crown cover (ca. 1930) also influenced present-day lichen richness. Geographic location, distance to sea, wooded meadow area and average tree circumference were important determinants of lichen species composition. Tree circumference was the strongest overall predictor of the number of species on individual trees. However, tree circumference interacted with management regime, whereby cessation of management appeared to reduce species richness most on large trees. Traditionally managed sites, on average, supported the greatest richness of red-listed species.
   Conclusions
   Management regime, wooded meadow area and canopy cover were the main drivers of lichen species richness, while geographic location, wooded meadow area, distance to sea and average tree circumference were important determinants of species composition.

AB  - The effects of forest continuity at local scale for red-listed and indicator species of epiphytic lichens and bryophytes were investigated in 150 Fagus sylvatica stands in southern Sweden. Stands having forest continuity (n =106) had continuous forest cover more than 350 years, whereas stands lacking continuity (n = 44) had forest cover less than 160 years. Forest continuity was identified by comparing a sequence of historical maps with a modern survey of beech forests. In the field woody beech substrates were searched for the epiphytes of interest. A number of environmental and spatial variables were inventoried and compiled for each stand. In all 64 species (51 lichens, 13 bryophytes) were found in the stands having continuity, and 21 (14 lichens, 7 bryophytes) in the stands lacking continuity. Controlling for the different number of surveyed stands, stands having continuity had significantly more species of lichens, but not of bryophytes. In the stands lacking continuity we did not find lichens associated with the very late succession stage. The quantity of substrates, stand age and forest continuity were the three most important factors explaining species richness as well as composition of studied epiphytes. The effect of continuity was probably due to a combination of a higher substrate quality, mainly old beeches, and a longer time available for colonization. Also, we found strong positive correlations between number of indicator and red-listed epiphyte species. In short-term conservation old stands having continuity, containing suitable substrates and indicator species are target areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many epiphytes in Swedish beech forests are associated with old and damaged trees. In this study we examined the impact of bark, soil and stemflow pH, water-holding capacity and bark structures on this association. We also analyzed whether the influence of these factors differed between species of conservation concern (red-listed and indicator species of woodland key habitats) and species not of conservation concern. One hundred and one age-determined living beech trees (range 58-277 yrs) in 13 beech-dominated stands were surveyed in a forest landscape in southern Sweden. We recorded 119 species in total (76 lichens, 43 bryophytes) of which 21 were red-listed and 17 indicator species (26 lichens, 12 bryophytes). NMS ordination showed that the species composition of lichens changed primarily with tree age and along the gradient of smooth bark versus moss cover. Bark pH and tree vitality were the most important gradients for bryophyte composition. The combination of old damaged beech trees and high bark pH resulted in the highest mean number of species of conservation concern for both lichens and bryophytes. The link between these factors is partly explained by a positive effect of tree age on the stemflow pH. Species number of bryophytes not of conservation concern increased with bark pH, whereas the corresponding group of lichens was favored primarily by increased light availability. Neither the water-holding capacity of bark nor soil pH affected patterns of species number. The results from this study show that old beech trees infected by fungi, with a higher bark pH, are the most valuable trees for epiphytes of conservation concern.

AB  - Hydropower is expanding globally and is regarded a key measure for mitigating climate change, but it also results in major environmental degradation, both at local scale and more widely. We can learn lessons about how restoration can be used to alleviate these problems from failures and successes in countries with a long history of hydropower development, such as Norway. Here, hydropower projects grew larger over time, and in the 1960s, the emerging environmentalist movement started to challenge hydropower developments because of their negative impacts on the environment. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate then appointed a landscape architect who became very influential, particularly due to his skills in aesthetics and photo documentation. He developed principles for designing self-sustaining environments which he called "living nature", and in particular proposed methods of restoring barren, unattractive, alpine spoil heaps. Later, restoration methods and goals have changed in response to new insights and the changing goals of ecological restoration. Here, we present current best practice for the alpine biome and sum up general lessons in three points: restoration can represent a sustainable, 'third way' in the conflict between conservation and development; including a wider group of professionals may improve restoration goals and methods, and effective use of visual communication can be a good way of gaining support for new restoration principles.

AB  - Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry.

AB  - Fragmentation of old-growth forests and greatly reduced amounts of coarse dead wood in managed forests threat the persistence of many saproxylic species in boreal Fennoscandia. Individual old-growth forest remnants may lose species over time as they pay off their extinction debt. We tested this by comparing the observed site occupancy of individual wood-inhabiting fungal species in isolated old-growth stands (i.e. woodland key habitats; WKHs) with statistical predictions of their occupancy assuming potential extinction debt had already been paid off. The occupancy of species was analysed in two sets of WKHs differing in time since isolation (i.e. recent and old isolates).
   Few species occurred more frequently than expected in WKHs. However, patterns across species and across all WKHs masked important differences among species in their risk of facing future extinction. The site occupancy decreased significantly between recent and old isolates for a group of annual, red-listed specialist fungal species, suggesting that an extinction debt in WKHs may exist among specific species confined to coarse dead wood and old-growth forest habitat. Generalist species that also occur in the surrounding matrix showed no negative trends, or actually increased in site occupancy, making future extinctions less likely. Thus, continuing loss of threatened species are likely if not preservation of WKHs are combined with other conservation efforts in managed forest landscapes. Natural forest landscapes may serve as important references when aiming to identify species in risk of future extinction but more detailed knowledge about the biology of the most vulnerable species is also required.

AB  - When space is limited, there is often conflict over land use such as agriculture, nature conservation, housing, business and Fir commercial enterprise. More knowledge is needed about the substance of such conflicts and the way the various uses are handled and spatially organised. Using empirical material collected in Hallnas, Sweden, and Sandnes, Norway, between 2009 and 2012, this paper addresses the potential conflicts and synergies between the different uses of land, with agriculture as a reference point. In combining and comparing the results from Hallnas and Sandnes, the way in which relations differ between them are also scrutinised. Through planning documents, interviews with officials in public authorities, active farmers, non-governmental organisations (NGO) and field visits, case-specific land uses are identified in the two areas. The conflicting and synergetic relations between agriculture and other ways the land is used are identified and illustrated by schematic models. The results indicate that agriculture is both in synergy and in conflict with other land uses. In the cases investigated in this study, the primary areas of conflict are between agriculture and biodiversity, between agriculture and cultural heritage, and between agriculture and climate-smart initiatives in terms of dense building structures.

AB  - New forestry practices have been developed during the past decade in order to enhance biodiversity in managed forests. In Finland, Forest Act legislation has attempted to identify a set of key habitats (Forest Act habitats) to conserve biodiversity. The importance of Forest Act habitats (FAHs) for threatened vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes was studied in SW Finland. Of the populations of threatened species outside nature reserves 78% occurred in habitat types included in the Forest Act, but only 28% of the populations occurred in sites fulfilling the criteria defined in the Act. Most of these populations occurred in herb-rich forests, cliff forests and rock outcrops serving as hot spot habitats for threatened species. However, only 4% of the populations of threatened species occurring in sites fulfilling the criteria of the Forest Act were actually located in sites defined as FAHs by the forestry authorities. Furthermore, recent logging activities had often reduced the quality of defined FAH. In principle, FAHs have a potential to protect biodiversity in boreal forests, provided that the Act is properly implemented. However, the current study revealed an obvious gap between the Finnish forest legislation and its practical application, due to which the biodiversity targets of the Forest Act have been poorly fulfilled.

AB  - Theory posits that species with inter-individual variation in colour patterns should be less vulnerable to extinction, compared with species that do not vary in colour. To evaluate this prediction, we explored whether differences in colour pattern diversity was associated with extinction risk, using red-list status for more than 350 species of noctuid moths in Sweden. We also evaluated six other species characteristics that have been proposed to influence extinction risk namely: host plant niche breadth, habitat type, area of occupancy, body size, overwintering life-history stage and length of flight activity period. We found that species with variable colour patterns had reduced extinction risk overall compared with species having non-variable colour patterns, and that this difference was pronounced more strongly among species having smaller areas of occupancy. There were also significant associations with host plant niche breadth and habitat type, extinction risk being lower on average in polyphagous species and in generalist species that occupied different habitat types. These findings represent the first evidence for insects that variable colouration is associated with reduced extinction risks. Information on colour pattern variation is readily available for many taxa and may be used as a cost-effective proxy for endangerment in the work of halting national and global biodiversity loss.

AB  - Lithuania and surrounding countries are situated in the northern part of dormouse (Gliridae) distribution ranges. Garden dormouse may be extinct in all these countries because the last observations of this species were recorded in the end of 20th century. Fat dormouse is rare and declining in Lithuania and surrounding countries because of destruction of their habitats - felling of mature oak-dominated forests. Forest dormouse is rare because western limit of is distribution range goes through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Status of the hazel dormouse is different in the countries concerned. This species is common and widespread in Lithuania, but red-listed in Latvia and Belarus, and absent in large deforested areas in Poland. The hazel dormouse may be extinct in Estonia, but common and not threatened in southern Sweden. In different countries, status of the hazel dormouse depends on anthropogenic influence on its habitats and probably also on investigation level. Some outdated information on distribution and status of some dormouse species is presented in the IUCN red lists.

AB  - This study investigated the forest history, structural characteristics, the presence of fungal species suggested to indicate ecological continuity in old-growth forest, and the species composition of saproxylic beetles in 30 old forest "woodland key habitats" (WKHs). and compared them with production forest in the same age-class in south-eastern Norway. No statistically significant differences in forest characteristics, community of saproxylic beetles or number of red-listed beetles were found between the WKHs and the production forest, probably owing to a combination of profound long-term logging and a lack of will to delineate sufficiently large WKHs in the one area with significantly less forestry impact. The study indicates the advantage of including forest history information in WKH selection where such data exist, and the importance of restoring habitats in heavily exploited forest landscapes.

AB  - Accurate information on total catch and effort is essential for successful fisheries management. Officially reported landings, however, may be underestimates of total catch in many fisheries. We investigated the fishery for the nationally red-listed European lobster (Homarus gammarus) in south-eastern Norway. Probability-based strip transect surveys were used to count buoys in the study area in combination with catch per unit effort data obtained independently from volunteer catch diaries, phone interviews, and questionnaires. We estimate that recreational catch accounts for 65% of total catch in the study area. Moreover, our results indicate that only a small proportion (24%) of lobsters landed commercially were sold through the legal market and documented. Total estimated lobster catch was nearly 14 times higher than reported officially. Our study highlights the need for adequate catch monitoring and data collection efforts in coastal areas, presents a clear warning to resource managers that illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries in coastal areas should not be ignored, and shows the potential impact of recreational fisheries.

AB  - New conservation-oriented forestry aims to maintain intact populations of forest organisms by improving the conservation value of managed forests and providing protected areas. We tested the conservation value of treatments of dead wood for assemblages of early successional saproxylic beetles. In nine areas in northern Sweden, we selected one clear-cut, one mature managed forest and one reserve. In 2001-2002, we placed three blocks of spruce logs, each containing control, burned and shaded logs and a high stump ("snag") at each site. Saproxylic beetles emerging from the dead wood were collected using emergence traps and beetles flying close to it were collected using flight-intercept traps. After one year of exposure, assemblage composition was examined, with respect to nutritionally-defined functional groups, red-listed species and fire-favoured species. Experimental snags were most complementary to control logs, supporting different assemblages of cambium consumers and fungivores and supporting more red-listed individuals. Burned logs supported depauperate assemblages, particularly with respect to cambium consumers, while shading of logs affected assemblages of fungivores, but only on clear-cuts. Despite containing less dead wood, managed forests provided valuable habitat, supporting similar assemblages of saproxylic beetles to reserves. Most functional groups were less abundant on clear-cuts than in older forests, but fire-favoured species were more common on clear-cuts, suggesting that clear-cuts may support assemblages of species associated with natural disturbances, if suitable substrates are available. Utilization of logs by saproxylic beetles changes over time, so long-term monitoring of our experimental logs will determine their lifetime conservation value. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest restoration measures, such as dead wood retention and creation at the time of final felling, increase the amount of dead trees and should benefit a large proportion of species dependent on sun-exposed dead wood. In this study, the value of retained dead wood and high-cut stumps was evaluated in terms of how much they contribute to the population of the red-listed beetle Peltis grossa in a forest landscape. The evaluation was based on a population estimate before and after restoration started in the study landscape. The restoration started in 1994 with 425 high-cut stumps of Norway spruce on six experimental clear-cuts and continued 4 years later with high-cutting and retention of dead trees becoming a standard measure in the 10 000-ha forest landscape. Ten years after high-cutting, adults of P. grossa started to emerge from the stumps on the experimental clear-cuts and the number of emergence holes was counted each year during the following eight years (2003-2010). During this period, the average yearly recruitment of P. grossa from these stumps were c. 300 individuals, adding up to a total of c. 2250 emergence holes. In 2005, all clear-cuts made during 1990-2000 and random samples of young and old forest stands were inventoried in transects across the landscape. In total, 1219 emergence holes were found in 2005; all of them on the clear-cuts and none in the forest stands. Our study is the first to show that habitat restoration can increase population growth of a threatened saproxylic species on a landscape scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Isolation of habitats in space and time affects species globally and in a multitude of ecosystems. It is however often difficult to assess the level of isolation from the point of view of the focal species. Indicator species are often used to assess 'conservation value' of habitats. One such approach involves the use of wood-decaying fungal species as indicators of near-natural forests, continuity in old-forest characteristics over time, and/or presence of red-listed species, but not of spatial connectivity. The indicator species were commonly assigned based on expert opinions, but few scientific evaluations have been performed of what these species actually indicate. Building on previous classifications of wood-decaying fungal indicator species on Norway spruce, we hypothesized that indicator species would differ from non-indicator species in how they respond to local temporal connectivity (forest age, the intensity of historical selective logging and the presence of well-decomposed large logs), and to local and landscape-scale spatial connectivity (local forest area, local amount of deadwood and the connectivity to old forest in the surrounding landscape). Based on fungal occurrence data from a fixed number of spruce logs at 28 sites distributed across the Scandinavian Peninsula, we explored the spatiotemporal scales at which the local communities were affected by connectivity. Indicator species showed the strongest response to connectivity of old forest (>= 80 years) within 100 km, while non-indicator species depended on connectivity of younger forest (>= 40 years) at a smaller spatial scale (>= 25 km). Indicator species increased and non-indicator species decreased in total abundance with the increasing age of the local forest stand. Landscape-scale old-forest connectivity was beneficial for indicator species in all sites except those with relatively low amount of deadwood, while non-indicator species showed the opposite pattern. We identify a threshold of around 29 m(3) ha(-1) in the amount of spruce logs where indicator species become abundant enough to influence non-indicator species through competitive interactions. There was a pronounced uniformity within each species group in the connectivity responses. We conclude that the studied indicator species indicate high forest age, high amount of resources and, given that the resources are plentiful, also high old-forest connectivity, but they do not indicate a long history without any logging operations or local deadwood continuity. The studied non-indicator species did not indicate any of the studied spatiotemporal connectivity variables. Indicator species are usually red-listed and may continue to decline in the future without habitat restoration efforts.

AB  - Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are major factors leading to forest biodiversity decline. This paper discusses landscape planning as strategy to improve connectivity in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of ecologically valuable areas across land owners. A tax-fund system is proposed, that following the principle of conunon but differentiated responsibility, tries to spread the burden of conservation equally across land owners while optimizing the environmental outcome. Design options of such a tax-fund system are discussed along the lines of a simple theoretical model. Financial effects of a tax-fund system are computed for a small model landscape set in Sweden. Two design questions stand out as particularly important. The first is whether the policy is intended to be self-sustained among the land owners or if the budget can be supplemented by general tax, money. The second is whether the land owners or the relevant authority select the stands for conservation set-aside.

AB  - Urban green areas are becoming increasingly recognized for their biodiversity potential. However, little is known about how urbanization shapes cryptic species communities, such as those residing in deadwood. In this study, we investigated downed Norway spruce trunks at intermediate stages of decay, in urban and semi-natural forests in southern Finland. To understand the interconnections between landscape context, deadwood characteristics and wood-inhabiting fungal communities, we studied structural characteristics, surface epiphyte cover and internal moisture and temperature conditions of the tree trunks, and fungal communities residing in the wood. Our findings showed that urban tree trunks had less epiphyte cover and lower moisture than trunks in semi-natural forests. Overall, urban forests provide less favourable habitats for a majority of the dominant wood-inhabiting fungal species and for red-listed species as a group. Yet, 33% of urban trunks hosted at least one red-listed species. While these landscape-scale effects may be driven by local climatic conditions as well as contingencies related to available species pools, our results also highlight the significance of substrate-scale variability of deadwood in shaping wood-inhabiting fungal communities. We show that epiphyte cover is a significant driver or indicator of these small-scale dynamic processes in deadwood.

AB  - One of the potentially useful indirect shortcut methods in biodiversity conservation is the umbrella species concept. An umbrella species can be seen relatively demanding for the size of the area and probably also for certain habitat types: conservation management for the umbrella species would thus encompass other species preferring similar habitats but with smaller area requirements. As such, it has a comprehensive spatial aspect for landscape planning. We tested the role of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) as an umbrella species for wood dependent species among red-listed and old-growth forest associated polypores, epiphytic lichens and beetles. Flying squirrels inhabit home ranges of several to tens of hectares, and prefer mature spruce- dominated (Picea abies) mixed forests, which often have high amounts of dead wood. We carried out species surveys and trappings during 1 year from 20 mature spruce-dominated forest stands (altogether 162 ha), of which 12 were occupied by the flying squirrel. The amount of dead wood was higher in occupied stands than in unoccupied stands. We also found a tendency for a higher number of species and number of records in occupied stands, a relationship mostly due to the polypore species. The presence of the flying squirrel may reflect the habitat availability for species depending on dead and living wood, and assist in site selection of conservation areas. We suggest that the flying squirrel has potential as an umbrella species to partly enhance maintenance of biodiversity in northern boreal forests in Finland. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Throughout the northern hemisphere old forests with high abundance of dead wood are rare features in most landscapes today, and the loss of dead wood constitutes a serious threat to the existence of many species. This study, using field surveys and dendrochronology, examines the relationship between wood-inhabiting fungi and past forest utilisation along a gradient of early logging activity. Data were collected in three late-successional Scots pine forests in northern Sweden. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) was then used to assess differences in species composition among the forests. Our results show that minor forest logging (22-26 cut stumps ha(-1)) carried out a century ago may have continuing effects on forest characteristics, including dead wood dynamics and the wood-inhabiting fungal community especially the abundance of red-listed species. The most important effects are lower numbers of logs in early and intermediate stages of decomposition. Additionally, numbers of species (including red-listed species) can be high in forests that have been subject to low levels of logging. Overall, the high species numbers recorded in this study (n = 60-87) show that old, low-productivity pine forests harbour a considerable fraction of the total diversity of Basidiomycetes in northern Fennoscandian boreal forests. We conclude that the formation of a framework linking forest history and environmental data is vital for understanding the ecology and formulating goals for future management of these forests.

AB  - This paper develops a dynamic model for cost-effective selection of sites for restoring biodiversity when habitat quality develops over time and is uncertain. A safety-first decision criterion is used for ensuring a minimum level of habitats, and this is formulated in a chance-constrained programming framework. The theoretical results show; (i) inclusion of quality growth reduces overall cost for achieving a future biodiversity target from relatively early establishment of habitats, but (ii) consideration of uncertainty in growth increases total cost and delays establishment, and (iii) cost-effective trading of habitat requires exchange rate between sites that varies over time. An empirical application to the red listed umbrella species - white-backed woodpecker - shows that the total cost of achieving habitat targets specified in the Swedish recovery plan is doubled if the target is to be achieved with high reliability, and that equilibrating price on a habitat trading market differs considerably between different quality growth combinations.

AB  - Understanding of species distribution, abundance and habitat affinities is crucial for red-list assessment, conservation and habitat management. In Central Finland, we studied Collembola in three habitat types, namely non-grazed meadows, pastures and road verges using pitfall traps. Altogether, 9,630 Collembola individuals were recorded. These belonged to 12 families, 34 genera and 60 species. The number of specimens was clearly higher in meadows than in pastures or road verges. The number of species, however, was higher in meadows and road verges (40 and 39 species, respectively) than in pastures (33 species). The overall species number is comparable to other large-scale sampling schemes in similar habitats. We recorded a few abundant species (Spatulosminthurus flaviceps, Sminthurus viridis and Sminthurus nigromaculatus) that have been previously recorded from very different biotopes. In conclusion, biodiversity inventories of soil fauna, as well as other biota, should also include marginal habitats, which often host peculiar communities.

AB  - Cucujus cinnaberinus (Scopoli, 1763) is a saproxylic beetle listed in the IUCN Red List and the European Habitats Directive. Although the species is highly protected and often red-listed little is known about its ecological requirements and status of its populations. Therefore, our main aims were to review its current and historical distributions and status of C. cinnaberinus populations in Europe and to determine its recent habitat preferences at the landscape level in the Czech Republic, where the increasing number of records over the last few years indicates a possible increase in abundance of this beetle. Cucujus cinnaberinus is closely associated with soft-wood and broad leaved trees and is able to colonize man-made habitats from persisting local populations if there is a sufficient supply of suitable dead wood. This beetle is not restricted to old-growth forests or even relict woodland, as previously reported, but currently predominantly inhabits abandoned planted stands of trees like lignicultures or avenues, which have an open canopy. Colonization of stands dominated by hybrid poplars probably resulted in the recent increase in the number of records of this species in the central European countries. However, this could present problems for the protection of this species in future, because the trees in these stands are gradually dying and are not being replaced. The decline and extinction of C. cinnaberinus on the northern and southern edges of its distribution was probably caused by the absence of soft-wooded broadleaved trees in intensively managed forests and other more suitable habitats.

AB  - Reintroduction of locally extinct species is increasingly applied as a conservation tool for re-establishing species within their historical ranges. Thus far, this option has however not been investigated for fungi other than lichens. A large fraction of wood-inhabiting fungal species have declined because of forest loss and fragmentation, in addition to a decrease in dead wood. Here, we show the results from an experiment carried out in southern Finland, which demonstrates that inoculation is an effective method for reintroducing threatened wood-inhabiting fungi. All selected red-listed fungal species successfully established in the inoculated logs as mycelia, and three out of the seven produced fruit-bodies. Success rate was greater when the strains were inoculated in early-decay logs, including species that usually fruit in late decay stages. Inoculation can provide an effective tool for reintroducing fungal species, as the source populations remain intact and it is possible to produce massive amounts of inoculation-units with relatively low cost. Reintroductions of fungi should however be preceded by a risk assessment of the species to be reintroduced, by using source populations from nearby localities, and they should be considered complementary to the primary target of increasing the amount of their habitat. Our results suggest that the reintroduction of threatened fungi via inoculation in combination with other conservation measures can have important bearings for forest conservation and restoration.

AB  - This paper reviews the approaches to multiple objective landscape planning that have developed in Swedish forestry in the 1990s. The objectives of such planning include primarily timber production and maintenance of biodiversity, but also aspects such as aesthetics and recreation. The variety of approaches and models that have emerged is caused by regional differences in land-use history, forest conditions, recreation pressure, and ownership. We distinguish three approaches: The species approach and the naturalness approach integrate conservation aspects, while the multiple aspects approach integrates several aspects (biological, social, economic, spiritual, etc.) into commercial timber-producing forestry. The species approach is exemplified by the key habitat - corridor model in which key habitats and corridors are preserved to support certain species. The natural landscape model illustrates an example of the naturalness approach, as it integrates natural forest features from a fire-disturbed landscape and gives examples of management implications at the landscape as well as at the stand level. The multiple aspects approach combines several objectives and defines important structures rather loosely. This approach was developed in areas where private nonindustrial forestry dominates. Nontimber and nonconservation aspects therefore become relevant to forest management. The supportive feature model exemplifies an application of that approach.

AB  - Numerous anthropogenic stressors, including river regulation, excess loadings of nutrients and sediment, channelisation, as well as thermal and hydrological stressors driven by climate change impact riverine ecosystems worldwide. In a time when freshwater degradation and the rate of global warming are faster than ever, understanding the potential interactive effects of local and catchment-scale stressors with large-scale climatic conditions is essential to enhance our ability to plan effective conservation, restoration, and mitigation measures. In this study we analysed a dataset spanning the whole of Sweden using a space-for-time approach to investigate interactive effects of land use, river regulation, and climate on brown trout (Salmo trutta) abundance in streams. We found that in warmer regions trout populations were negatively affected in catchments with more intense river regulation by hydropower dams (i.e. >= 10 m(3)/km(2) total reservoir storage volume). In such catchments, a 7 degrees C warmer mean summer air temperature was associated with an average between 44% and 83% decline in trout abundance. In catchments with less intense river regulation, trout abundance instead increased moderately with increasing temperature. We also found that brown trout abundance declined with increasing areal extent of urban areas when found in combination with >= 20% agricultural land use. When agricultural land use reached maximum values (84%), brown trout abundance decreased from an average of 13 individuals per 100 m(2) in catchments with no urban areas to values <= 1 in catchments with >= 5% urban land use. Also, brown trout abundance declined with increasing agricultural land use in catchments with >= 3% urban land use. Our study brings innovative empirical evidence of interactive effects between river regulation, land use and climate on brown trout populations. From a management perspective our findings suggest that: (1) restoring natural flows (e.g. through dam removal) and riparian vegetation could mitigate adverse effects of climate change; and (2) restoration measures that minimise the effects of agriculture and urban land use (e.g. reduction of nutrient levels and restored riparian buffer zones) could help rehabilitate brown trout in catchments with high anthropogenic land use change. However, given the large observed variation between streams, we advise for bespoke management actions stemming from sound knowledge of local habitat conditions and target populations, whenever possible, using an ecosystem management-based approach.

AB  - Destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats results in small species populations that face increased risk of extinction. A time delay may be involved in the regional extinction of species, and the number of species that eventually may go extinct in the future is called the "extinction debt." In boreal Sweden, we examined whether the number of epiphytic crustose lichens and wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth forest remnants diverges from species richness levels in forest patches that have been naturally isolated for millennia. An excess of species in forest remnants could indicate the presence of an extinction debt. Observed species richness in 32 old-growth forest remnants (also called woodland key habitats [WKHs]) was compared with predicted species richness. To predict species richness we used regression models based on data from 46 isolated old-growth forest patches in a forest-wetland matrix. The reference landscape is ancient and assumed to reflect the conditions of insular floras in dynamic equilibrium. Stand factors constituted predictive variables in the models. The observed number of lichen species was higher than expected (i.e., an extinction debt among lichens may exist). By contrast, there was no significant difference between observed and expected species richness among wood-inhabiting fungi. The species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi has adjusted to the changes in forest and landscape structure more rapidly than the species richness of lichens. Differences in substrate dynamics between epiphytes on living trees and species growing on decaying logs might explain the difference between species groups. The results also indicate that population densities of red-listed species were low, which may result in continuing extinctions of red-listed species. The importance of WKHs might be overvalued because species may be lost if conservation efforts consider only protection and preservation of WKHs.

AB  - Climate change has considerably dominated science-policy dialogue, public debate, and subsequently environmental policies since the three "Rio Conventions" were born. This has led to practically independent courses of action of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation actions, neglecting potential conflicts among outcomes and with missed opportunities for synergistic measures. Transformative governance principles have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Using a transformative governance lens, we use the case of the Norwegian "Climate Cure 2030" for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector to, first, illustrate the mechanisms that have led to the choice of climate mitigation measures; second, to analyze the potential consequences of these measures on biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and, third, to evaluate alternative measures with potential positive outcomes for biodiversity and GHG emissions/removals.

AB  - In conservation planning, maps do important work in producing territories of stronger and weaker protection, and spatially fixing special handling of development. Because of this, mapping and maps are contested, yet there have been few studies of their roles in planning conflicts. The performance of maps in planning processes affecting a wild reindeer habitat in Setesdal, Norway is analysed, asking what is the productive work of maps in planning, how is this work contested, and what are the consequences for the status of the plan itself. The case study centres on a proposal for wind power development, in an area designated in regional planning as a wild reindeer area of national significance. The analysis combines empirical material from interviews, planning documents and observation. The findings show the work that maps do in producing a new conservation territory, changing the basis of planning, yet failing to resolve deep-seated conflicts of interest.

AB  - Species living in open sandy habitats are declining in northern Europe because of habitat loss and degradation. However, mining of sand creates potential new habitats for these species in the form of sand pits. In this study we investigated the beetle fauna in sand pits in order to determine what kind of sand pits are the most valuable for conservation, in terms of sand pit area (primarily) and the proportion of sand material, vegetation cover, tree cover and edge habitats. Thirteen sand pits in Uppsala County, Sweden, ranging in size from 0.02 to 18 ha, were included in this study. A total of 2,500 individuals of beetles, belonging to 256 species, were sampled by pitfall traps. Thirty-nine of the species were classified as specialized sand-dwelling species and two were Swedish Red List species. We found that the area of sand pits affects both species number and species composition of beetles. A positive species-area relationship was found, best explained by a quadratic power function, for the habitat-specific species (i.e., sand species). Our recommendation is to prioritize sand pits with areas between 0.3 and 5 ha, with preference towards the lower end of this range, for conserving sand-dwelling beetles.

AB  - The survey conducted under the Ancient Meadows and Pastures project represents a new approach in nature conservation in Sweden, where natural and cultural heritage values were inventoried and analysed in an integrated holistic approach between 1985 and 1497. The model for the survey, developed jointly by researchers and planners, is composed of four steps: methodological development of data collection; national survey and regional ranking; national analysis; and applications. This paper describes the conceptual model, the methodological development and national analysis. The method development is composed of strategic selection of criteria for natural and cultural values, development of classification systems, development of techniques for aerial photo interpretation, methods for fieldwork and description, evaluation and ranking. The data collection is based on interpretation in stereo pairs of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs with selection of potentially valuable meadows and pastures which are inventoried and checked in the field for cultural-historical nature types, cultural elements, vegetation types and selected indicator species of vascular plants. They are also described from a holistic landscape ecological perspective, integrating the cultural and biological components within the entire landscape and, finally, ranked for nature conservation into four classes. The evaluation emphasises botanical values together with long-term continuity in landuse and management, underpinned with cultural components. The national analysis showed that nearly 200,000 ha of ancient meadows and pastures are well managed and of high value. They are distributed among more than 17,000 objects and 22 cultural-historical nature types. Most were pastures (98%). The result is not only increased knowledge of the distribution of ancient meadows and pastures and a high number of well-managed pasture landscapes throughout Sweden, but also a change in attitude among farmers, towards more positive attitudes to nature conservation and biodiversity and understanding of the cultural landscape. This project has had an important influence, because if is used in regional nature conservation work, has formed the principal basis of several thousands of management agreements with farmers, is used in policy work in the national nature protection plan and in the biodiversity action plan. The database also provides a good foundation for research in cultural landscapes, biodiversity and landscape ecology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Very old trees harbour a diverse fauna of saproxylic insects, many of which are classified as threatened due to the scarcity of this kind of habitat. Parks, which often contain many old trees, are therefore considered to be important sites for this fauna. However parks are intensively managed and dead wood is often removed. Therefore this study compares if the saproxylic beetle fauna in parks is as diverse as it is in more natural stands. Eight 'Park' sites at manor houses around lake Malaren, Sweden were compared with trees in wooded meadows: eight grazed sites, here termed 'Open', and 11 sites regrown with younger trees, termed 'Re-grown'. The comparison was made on lime trees (Tilia spp.): one of the most frequent tree species in old parks which host a diverse beetle fauna. Beetles were sampled with window traps, which in total caught 14,460 saproxylic beetles belonging to 323 species, of which 50 were red-listed. When comparing all saproxylic species, 'Park' sites had significantly fewer species than 'Open' sites. However, for beetles in hollow trees and for red-listed species there was no significant difference, the number in 'Park' being intermediate between 'Open' and 'Re-grown'. Species composition differed between sites, but only marginally so. Therefore, the conclusion is that old park trees on average are as valuable for faunal diversity as trees in more natural sites. Large conservation benefits can be obtained by combining cultural and conservational values in the management of park habitats.

AB  - An extensive follow-up study of day- and night-active Macrolepidoptera was performed during 2004 at the Kullaberg Nature Reserve located in the south-western part of Sweden. Butterflies were surveyed in an area of 100 km(2) and night-active moths were trapped in the core area of the reserve. Macrolepidopteran species resident in the area in the 1950s were compared with species resident in the area in 2004. As much as 159 of 597 species (27%) resident in the area in 1950s were not found at all in 2004 and 22 species (4%) had colonised the area. Butterflies exhibited a disastrous decline with a loss of 45% of the fauna, and day-active species had declined more than night-active species had. Species distribution pattern and species characteristics were used to predict the probability that a species had become extinct or colonised the area. Species limited to one or a few food plants, with a short flight-period or restricted to non-forest habitats were all associated with a high extinction risk. Species occurring in fewer European countries and recorded from few provinces in Sweden were all associated with a higher extinction risk compared with ubiquitous species. For expanding species (colonisers), the best predictor was their distribution area in Sweden and colonising species were more likely to be limited to a few provinces in the southernmost part of Sweden. Species extinct from Kullaberg also have decreased in Finland and species that had colonised Kullaberg also have increased in Finland, while the species with no change in Kullaberg are also relatively constant in Finland. Indeed, the macrolepidopteran fauna was severely reduced in the last 50 years and almost 70% of the habitat specialists were lost. For red-listed species the situation was found to be alarming. Almost 70% of red-listed species, resident in the area in the 1950s, was not found in 2004. This study highlights that species composition changes rapidly even in protected nature reserves and that similar changes in the macrolepidopteran fauna seem to occur over large areas.

AB  - Grazing and browsing by large herbivores is known to affect patterns of biodiversity. Still much remains to be done to assess the specific role of browsing on single, red listed plant species. In Norway, the yew (Taxes baccata) is a threatened species and several nature reserves have been established. We show, that within two nature reserves between 1988 and 2003, yew recruitment was strongly dependent on variation in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) browsing pressure. Our study emphasized that establishing nature reserves for yew is not enough to conserve this species unless control over browsing roe deer population is also taken. We argue that roe deer, being the most abundant large herbivore in Europe, may have a larger effect on conservation than currently realized. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to outline current foundations for sustainable landscape management in the Vilhelmina Model Forest, northwest Sweden. A case study revealed that the remaining patches of undisturbed or less disturbed boreal forest ecosystems comprise multiple values and, thus, constitute the basis for landscape planning. By identifying these patches, it is also possible to construct a spatial planning infrastructure for implementing sustainable management and land use. A more comprehensive toolbox needs to be developed, however, including monitoring and inventory schemes for relevant biophysical and socio-economic data, better temporal resolution for cause and effect analyses, and functioning scale-flexible planning and governance instruments.

AB  - Retention approaches in forest management are today common in several North European countries, integrated into the clearcutting practice as a way to promote biodiversity and maintain ecosystem functions. Individual green trees and retention patches (tree groups) are retained at final harvest, and deadwood is left at site or created. Here, we review research on retention in Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Baltic States, and NW Russia, with special focus on biodiversity. Following the first publication in 1994, about 180 peer-reviewed articles have been published. We present results from a systematic search of the retention literature, separated into the following topics: buffer zones, retention patches, high stumps, other types of deadwood, European aspen Populus tremula, and cost-efficiency. Russian literature is synthesized separately since studies from this region have so far almost exclusively been published in the Russian language. Furthermore, we describe six ongoing large-scale, replicated experiments with varying retention levels, five in Finland and one in Sweden, and summarize their main results. Among main conclusions for practice from the literature and experiments are that retention patches as large as 0.5 ha and 10-m-wide buffers to watercourses are not enough to maintain pre-harvest species composition but survival of forest species is still larger than on conventional clearcuts. Deadwood on clearcuts may present important habitats to saproxylic species, including rare and red-listed ones and a prioritization of tree species per stand is recommended. We identify several important future research directions including switch of focus towards the landscape as well as the species population level. Surveys in parts of European Russia where retention has been unintentionally implemented already for a century would indicate possible future trajectories of biodiversity and their drivers in other regions of Northern Europe. A stronger link to ecological theory would help in study designs and in the formulation of predicted outcomes.

AB  - Natural disturbance-based management and conservation strategies are needed to protect forest biodiversity. Boreal forests of northern Europe are typically clearcut and otherwise intensively managed for timber production. As a result, natural disturbances such as forest fires have became rare and the volume of dead wood has decreased. These changes have had a profound negative effect on species that depend on dead wood (saproxylic). Therefore, it is important to determine whether modifications of forest management methods can enhance the survival of these species. In our study area in southern Finland, we determined whether burning of logged sites and leaving trees (i.e., retention trees) on the sites benefited saproxylic, rare, and red-listed beetle species and how long the burned sites remained suitable habitat for these species. We surveyed the beetle fauna at 40 sites logged 1-16 years previously, 20 of which were burned after logging. The abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles were positively affected by burning, but the effect depended on the retention of trees in the otherwise clearcut stands. The difference between burned and unburned sites increased with the number of retention trees, and the effect of burning was not significant when there were fewer than approximately 15 retention trees/ha. Most important, the species groups that were unlikely to persist in ordinarily managed forests (rare saproxylic and red-listed beetles), benefited strongly from burning and tree retention. The species richness of saproxylic beetles decreased with time since logging at both burned and at unburned sites. We conclude that burning of logged sites and leaving an adequate number of retention trees may be useful in the conservation of disturbance-adapted species and can be used to improve the environmental quality of the matrix surrounding protected areas. Unfortunately, sites remained high-quality habitat for only a short time; thus, a continuum of burned areas must be ensured.

AB  - Unsustainable use of forest resources is causing dramatic changes in the landscape and poses a serious threat to biodiversity worldwide. This threat is becoming increasingly tangible in boreal biomes, especially in regions where intensive production-oriented forestry is widely applied. Legislation is one of the key tools for preserving nature from anthropogenic damage, but rarely its effectiveness is evaluated. We assessed the effectiveness of guidelines enforcing Finnish legislation aimed at preserving sites occupied by the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), a vulnerable species in Finland (and Europe), from destruction due to forest clear-cutting practices which often target its primary habitat, mature mixed forests. Using a before-after-control-impact design, we found that current protection measures for preserving breeding/resting areas do not maintain site occupancy (e.g. the proportion of years when a site was found occupied) by flying squirrel. We show that a dramatic reduction in occupancy after clear-felling was not paralleled by a similar change in occupancy at sites used as controls, where occupancy was stable through time. The collapse in occupancy at sites where the forest was clear-cut according to the guidelines can be explained by the reduction in suitable area by half of its original amount within 200 m, and by two thirds within 100 m as a consequence of tree harvest. The results provide clear evidence of the inefficacy of current guidelines to maintain suitable breeding/resting habitat to this species and thus, a revision is critically needed. We conclude that evaluating effectiveness is crucial for enhancing the impact of conservation measures at tackling the massive biodiversity crisis worldwide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context Both climatic extremes and land-use change constitute severe threats to biodiversity, but their interactive effects remain poorly understood. In forest ecosystems, the effects of climatic extremes can be exacerbated at forest edges. Objectives We explored the hypothesis that an extreme summer drought reduced the richness and coverage of old-growth forest species, particularly in forest patches with high edge exposure. Methods Using a high-resolution spatially explicit precipitation dataset, we could detect variability in drought intensity during the summer drought of 2018. We selected 60 old-growth boreal forest patches in central Sweden that differed in their level of drought intensity and amount of edge exposure. The year after the drought, we surveyed red-listed and old-growth forest indicator species of vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes. We assessed if species richness, composition, and coverage were related to drought intensity, edge exposure, and their interaction. Results Species richness was negatively related to drought intensity in forest patches with a high edge exposure, but not in patches with less edge exposure. Patterns differed among organism groups and were strongest for cyanolichens, epiphytes associated with high-pH bark, and species occurring on convex substrates such as trees and logs. Conclusions Our results show that the effects of an extreme climatic event on forest species can vary strongly across a landscape. Edge exposed old-growth forest patches are more at risk under extreme climatic events than those in continuous forests. This suggest that maintaining buffer zones around forest patches with high conservation values should be an important conservation measure.

AB  - Forestry in Sweden has since long been focused on production of conifer timber, but during the last decades the production of other goods and services has become more pronounced. An example of this shift towards multiple-use forestry can be found in the Swedish Forestry Act stipulating that equal weight should be put on preservation of biodiversity and timber production. The demand on multiple-use forestry to reach multiple goals creates a classical production allocation problem. In this study a method for analysing certain spatial production allocation problems in a forestry context is presented. The method is used to evaluate two different strategies for allocation of timber production and production of nature conservation values. One is the strategy of applying one stand management regime in all stands over a forest, given that it produces both timber and nature conservation. The other is the strategy of applying different stand management regimes over the forest. The results show that the strategy of applying different stand management regimes leads to greater production possibilities for timber and nature conservation values compared to the other strategy. However, if the goals of forestry change towards nature conservation, the use of the differentiated strategy could imply a more restricted planning space for nature conservation in the future.

AB  - Logging residues are increasingly being extracted for bioenergy purposes. This study estimates how extraction of fine woody debris (FWD) may affect the overall habitat availability for 577 species of wood-and bark-inhabiting basidiomycetes, beetles, and lichens in Sweden using Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) as their primary substrate. We combined modeling of (i) the amount of various types of woody debris available throughout a forest rotation in managed forests with (ii) a classification of each species' associations with different types of wood. In three different regions, we compared a scenario with no logging residue extraction with three different levels of extraction. Our results suggest that the extraction may cause a 35%-45% reduction in aboveground FWD and a more than 20% decline in the potential amount of substrate for about 50% of the species (affecting basidiomycetes and beetles more than lichens). The intensified forestry during the last century has, however, steadily increased the production of FWD. Furthermore, no red-listed species is primarily associated with logging residues of Norway spruce. Therefore, the current situation in Sweden with extraction of 70% of Norway spruce FWD on 50% of the clearcuts probably constitutes a minor contribution to the regional extinction risks.

AB  - Food production on the urban-rural fringe is under pressure due to competing land uses. We discuss the potential to improve resilience for urban-rural regions by enhancing food production as part of multifunctional land use. Through studies of peri-urban land in the regions of Gothenburg (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark) and Gent (Belgium), recent developments are analysed. Arable farming has been declining since 2000 in all three areas due to urban expansion and recreational land use changes. In city plans, networks of protected areas and green spaces and their importance for human wellbeing have been acknowledged. Policies for farmland preservation in peri-urban settings exist, but strategies for local food production are not expressed in present planning documents. Among the diversity of peri-urban agricultural activities, peri-urban food production is a developing issue. However, the competing forms of land use and the continuing high dependence of urban food on global food systems and related resource flows reduces peri-urban food production and improvements in urban food security. The positive effects of local food production need to be supported by governance aiming to improve the urban-rural relationship. The paper discusses the resilience potential of connecting urban-rural regions and re-coupling agriculture to regional food production.

AB  - This paper reports on the performance of the red-listed Primula scandinavica, endemic to Scandinavia. The study took place in Jotunheimen, Norway. We evaluated occurrence, density and sexual reproduction variables (number of fertile individuals and number of seed capsules). Habitats were registered as land-cover categories (historical and current; broad habitat types) and habitat patch classes (semi-natural and natural; fine-grained habitat types). Spatial overlay analyses and maximum likelihood tests of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to assess the habitat quality of the land-cover categories and the habitat patch classes. In most (96%) of the observed occurrences the species was located at a site that had open vegetation 40 years ago but is now becoming forested or covered by shrubs. The highest densities of P. scandinavica were found in "heathland" and "grassland in transition into woodland", while the potential for sexual reproduction was highest in "grassland" and lowest in "grassland in transition into woodland". The results indicate that many of the populations in the study area are remnants and that the habitats of highest quality are semi-natural habitat patches. The changed land use practices in mountain areas have resulted and will result in fewer and smaller populations. However, as also climatic conditions will change it is not straightforward to predict the future performance of P. scandinavica.

AB  - Sites at various distances from eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes and fens on the island A-land in southern Sweden were systematically surveyed in summer (May-August) and autumn (late September-October) to elucidate the hibernation sites of wetland carabid beetles. Thirty-five of 47 wetland species were found in their winter quarters. In areas a parts per thousand currency sign50 m from the lakes and fens, the observed as well as the estimated number of hibernating wetland species was higher in mesic to dry sites than in wet or moist open sites. Very few overwintering beetles were detected far (a parts per thousand yen120 m) from the water. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of macropterous and dimorphic (brachypterous) species and individuals hibernating close to, and more distantly from, water. Individuals of small species hibernated closer to water than larger ones. At least in Scandinavia, there is no convincing evidence that wetland species hibernate far away from water, migrating by flight. A considerable number of the species that were collected in their winter quarters are rare and red- listed in at least one of the Scandinavian countries. Winter quarters situated in mesic and dry meadows and woodland close to lakes and fens had the highest number of red-listed species. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to protect such sites. Threats to the integrity of the current habitats are logging and various transformations of meadows, e.g. digging and removal of large objects such as stones. Cessation of grazing by cattle may also have a negative effect.

AB  - The concept of Woodland Key Habitats (WKH, small-scaled presumed hotspots of biodiversity) has become an essential component of biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian and Baltic forests. There have been debates over the importance of WKHs in relation to the conservation of biodiversity in production forests. We applied a systematic review protocol and meta-analysis to summarize knowledge on comparisons of biodiversity qualities, such as dead wood and species richness, between WKHs and production forests in relevant countries. We also summarized the knowledge on the impact of edge effects by comparing WKHs surrounded by production forests to WKHs surrounded by clear cuts. Studies had been conducted in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on our meta-analysis, WKHs seem to be relative hotspots for dead wood volume, diversity of dead wood, number of species and number of red-listed species. There were some differences also between countries in these biodiversity qualities. Only two studies compared WKHs surrounded by production forests and clear cuts, respectively. Hence, the capability of WKHs to maintain their original species composition and support species persistence over time remains to be addressed, as well as their role in relation to other conservation tools.

AB  - The Transition towards sustainable energy systems requires phasing out fossil fuels. Hydropower is a key source of renewable energy and can contribute to reaching a 100 % low carbon-based energy system. Uncertainty remains about land cover changes due to hydropower deployment with a widespread perception of major losses in the land from inundation and associated habitat loss in the surrounding areas due to improved access and recreational use. Norway has a dominant share of hydropower generation in Europe with knowledge gaps in the associated land cover changes. We conducted one of the first retrospective analyses of land use change associated with hydropower development in Norway during the last 80 years. Using remote sensing data, we performed object-based analysis on sets of aerial images representing land systems before and after hydropower construction. We quantified the change in the land due to development of 40 hydropower schemes representing 24 % of the total Norwegian installed capacity. Our analysis revealed that 88 % of analyzed reservoirs were developed by regulating or expanding natural lakes. Vegetation growth was observed in the surrounding regions of 22 of 40 schemes, while urbanization was limited to only 0.9 % of the total surrounding area, primarily located within 400 m from reservoir's borders. Our findings provide insights into interaction between land use change and hydropower development in Norway. Our work provides a basis for further assessment of relevant environmental impacts and can be used to quantify expected land changes due to an increase in Norway's hydro-power with integration into the European energy market.

AB  - We estimated the need for nature reserves to maintain forest biodiversity in Sweden. Using habitat-loss thresholds for long-term survival of resident vertebrate "umbrella" species, and differences in forest disturbance regimes, we estimated the long-term protection in four biogeographic regions. No reserve need was assumed for forest environments that can be emulated by normal management. The estimates of the long-term need of reserves ranged from 9% (northern Sweden) to 16% southernmost Sweden) and was divided into: (1) existing protected forests (1.6-0.6%): (2) estimated benefits for biodiversity of special forest management (0.7-0%): (3) existing unprotected forests with high conservation value (3.5-1.9%). The remaining areas required to satisfy the long-term reserve goal were cultural landscape habitats (0-2.2%), as well as land for habitat restoration and re-creation (3-11%). Our analysis suggests that it is urgent to maintain all remnants of natural forests and cultural landscape habitats, but that forest protection alone is insufficient to maintain forest biodiversity.

AB  - Leaving small patches of forest intact at harvesting is now a standard procedure to mitigate negative effects on biodiversity. One purpose of the patches is to "life-boat" species over the forest regeneration phase, although the capacity of small forest fragments to do so is very uncertain. We investigated the survival of red-listed and indicator species of bryophytes and lichens in 74 retention patches in boreal Sweden. The patches were between 0.01 and 0.5 ha in size and of six different types with respect to tree species composition and location on the harvested area. Species presence and abundance were recorded shortly after harvest in transects covering the whole patches, and an identical inventory was carried out 6 years after the first. During this time, bryophytes generally decreased, most pronounced for liverworts. The largest decreases were found in buffer zones to streams and lakes and the smallest in tree groups dominated by deciduous trees. By contrast, among the lichens some species decreased while others increased, and there was no difference between retention patch types. Among the species abundant enough to be analyzed individually, the lichens Calicium parvum and Micarea globuloselia decreased less in larger patches and the bryophyte Hylocomiastrum umbratum decreased more in patches of irregular shape. The results imply that retention patches of this size might be too small to function as refugia for sensitive bryophytes and lichens until the surrounding forest regenerates, but that some lichens appear to persist or even increase. Retention harvesting is still a young management practice and further studies on its long-term conservation benefits will be valuable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Swedish urban forests originate mainly from the old production forests and are characterised by the forestry in practice at the time of urbanisation. Forests in the central parts of older urban areas are, therefore, generally old, while forests situated in newly urbanised areas are relatively younger, with proportionately more young stands. During the 1970s and 1980s, recommendations for the management of urban forests were concentrated on recreational forests on thr fringes of urban areas. The recommendations proposed more differentiation in silvicultural management: however, the direction to be taken was only weakly emphasised in the urban forestry because it had low priority in the plans of the Swedish local authorities. In the beginning of the 1990s, the ecological aspects of forests in urban areas came more into focus and successively led to parts of the urban forests bring given nature conservation status. Based on a classification of the urban forests into five zones, depending on their use and size, future improvements in urban forestry an suggested. The importance of satisfying the urban citizen's needs and demands for urban forestry is emphasised, as is the fact that:more research needs to be done on the human aspects, namely, people's perceptions, preferences, expectations, and emotional feelings about urban forests. The regeneration of the: urban forest, the management of young forests, the use of coppice with or without standards in urban areas, and the importance of forest edges and glades also give cause for further studies.

AB  - In this study of bryophyte diversity in 110 patches of spruce forests of bilberry, small fern, low herb, tall fern and tall herb type in Sor-Trondelag, central Norway, each patch (from 0.24 to 9.33 ha) was classified as one main vegetation type and one successional stage or cutting class. The bryophytes in each patch were censused in randomly established squares of 10 x 10 m, supplemented by complete sampling in the rest of the patch. A number of environmental variables was sampled, and the data sets treated with DCA and CCA. Altogether 210 bryophytes (71 liverworts and 139 mosses) were found in the squares, and 285 (96 liverworts and 189 mosses) in the forest patches. The average number of liverworts, mosses and bryophytes in forest patches increased gradually from the dry and poor to the moist and rich forest types. Several red listed and other interesting spruce forest species had their only or main occurrence in the rich and humid forest, and in old cutting classes.

AB  - Biodiversity management in broadleaved forests includes partial cutting to improve conditions for species that benefit from semi-open stand structure. The harvested wood is usually used as fuel and, therefore, it is stockpiled in situ for months before further processing. If such forest fuel piles attract saproxylic insects, they are likely to be ecological traps, because the settling cost for insects is death as the wood is chipped and used for energy. This study investigated beetle species composition in piles of oak wood in southern Sweden. Species density and frequency of occurrence were compared in wood with different diameters and at the top, middle and bottom parts of piles. A total of 39 species (six red-listed) and 3528 individual beetles emerged. The highest density of both individuals and species was in the top layer. No species was significantly more frequent in the middle or bottom layers. Diameter had only a limited effect on species density and individual species reproduced in both coarse and fine wood. In conclusion, forest fuel piles can be ecological traps for several uncommon and red-listed saproxylic beetles. The negative effects can be mitigated by removing the piles before the insects colonize them. If this is not possible, then the top layer should be retained.

AB  - To save a species on the verge of extinction, an urgent practical conservation action was performed on the Critically Endangered lichen species Leptogium hibernicum in Norway. A transplantation experiment at two lo-calities was carried out in close cooperation with the responsible authorities. An alarming problem for L. hibernicum is the imminent challenge of a habitat under threat. A parallel experiment with a comparable yet common species, Leptogium saturninum, was performed to exclude variables related to the experimental method. Four years after transplantation of lichen fragments, the rate of survival has levelled off to about 12% for L. hibernicum and 19% for L. saturninum. The decrease in surviving material is largest one year after trans-plantation, while the amount of surviving material stabilises over the following three years. Transplantation is here shown as a promising tool for the practical conservation of red-listed lichens.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficient marine areas under protection. Assessing the functionality and coherence of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique dataset of similar to 140,000 samples, recently collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, VELMU. Using the quantitative conservation planning and the spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of marine conservation values. Only 27% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses, a set of expansion sites were identified that efficiently complement the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing protected sea area by just one percent point, would double the mean conservation cover, and specifically increase the protection levels of habitat types based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, key species, threatened species and fish reproduction areas. We also discovered that a large part of ecologically valuable species, such as many brown and red algae, blue mussels and eelgrass, exist in the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores. These areas do not belong to the present (Finnish) interpretation of the habitats (e.g., reefs and underwater sandbanks) listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Neglecting these environments may lead to lack of protection of functionally important biodiversity. We emphasize that, in addition to establishing MPAs, also ecosystembased marine spatial planning is needed to safeguard the integrity of marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. The spatial prioritization maps produced in this study are essentially environmental value maps which can also be used in impact avoidance, such as siting of wind energy and aquaculture, or in avoiding overfishing in the most valuable fish areas. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated in the Baltic Sea or elsewhere provided that sufficient data exist.

AB  - The long history of human land use have had a strong influence on ecosystems and landscapes in the boreal forest region of Northern Europe and created semi-natural habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we quantify land-cover change and loss of semi-natural grassland in an agricultural landscape (6.2 km(2)) in the boreal region of Norway from 1960 to 2015, and document a 49.1% loss of area that was seminatural grassland in 1960. The remaining semi-natural grasslands became smaller and the connectivity between them decreased. Intensification and abandonment of agricultural land use were of approximately equal importance for the loss of semi-natural grassland although the relative contribution of these processes depended on the topography and distance to farmsteads. The study provides an example of how change in land cover can be estimated and key drivers identified on a scale that is relevant for implementation of management and conservation measures.

AB  - Historic towns are preserved and given new importance within the new cultural economy. This paper examines the conditions under which built heritage is being preserved in urban regeneration programmes in a Norwegian context. An interesting finding from this study of three towns, Stavanger, Mosjoen and Risor, is that the conservation plan itself was not the most important factor. Part of the answer to the relative success of the conservation of these areas constituted preservation plans combined with management tools adopted locally and practised with flexibility to allow for the changes necessary to modern living. Even more important were the collaborative forms of governance developed over time that managed to anchor the goals and norms of preservation in the population. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic alteration of stand composition and landscape pattern in Swedish forest landscapes managed for industrial wood production, remnant patches of deciduous forests and woodlands do not form a functional green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. We assessed if large herbivore browsing hampers the restoration of deciduous forest as green infrastructure by reducing the recruitment of boreal and temperate deciduous tree species of particular importance for biodiversity conservation. A natural experiment approach was applied in the distinct Swedish temperate-boreal forest gradient in Sweden. We measured the potential for saplings of aspen, rowan, sallow and oak to become recruited into the population of ecologically mature trees, as well as the amount of tree and field layer food. Sampling was made in forest stands representing four strata of managed forest landscapes accessible to large herbivores (experiment) and human settlements avoided by large herbivores (control). All four focal deciduous tree species had lower damage levels in controls (towns and villages) compared to experimental (forest) sites. While tree forage was much more abundant in controls, field layer forage in controls was not different from experimental stands. For all tree species except aspen we found a positive relationship between damage levels and large herbivore abundance, to which moose contributed > 89%. We discuss the role of research design for assessing the impact of large herbivores on plants, and highlight the need for integration of multi-species wildlife management as well as conservation planning and management.

AB  - Fragmentation of natural forests is a major threat to forest biodiversity. In areas with a long history of forestry, the remaining patches of old forests constitute only a minor part of the landscape. In such situations small stands may be valuable and important for conservation. However, as they may suffer from strong edge effects and isolation, their value may be lower than anticipated. In Sweden a national inventory of woodland key habitats (WKHs) has identified about 1% of the forest landscape as sites where red-listed species occur or may occur. Most are small (national median 1.4 ha) and isolated stands within an intensively managed landscape. The present analyses calculate WKH core area based on a range of depths of edge influence, and isolation based on both distance to nearest WKH and a weighted isolation measure that includes all neighboring WKHs and protected forest. These analyses are done on the WKHs in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden and include almost 5000 stands. The actual core area in the WKHs is about 30% given a 50 In edge influence. The degree of isolation is species dependent but the results indicate that only species with high dispersal abilities may effectively utilize the network of WKHs. For species with effective dispersal distances of less than 2 km the network is probably insufficient. The results emphasize the need to create buffer zones, to increase reserve areas and to manage the matrix so that species dispersal is promoted. This likely includes a necessity to aggregate biodiversity efforts on the landscape scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study analysed the cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures that increase substrate availability for saproxylic (wood-dwelling) species. Mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh and Betula pendula Roth) or aspen (Populus tremula L.) in three regions of Sweden were modelled. Inverted cost-effectiveness was calculated by dividing the economic cost associated with a silvicultural measure by the increase in coarse woody debris (CWD) and an index reflecting substrate availability for red-listed saproxylic beetles and cryptogams, compared with a reference scenario maximizing economic profit. Tree species had a large impact on the cost-effectiveness of green tree retention: Scots pine was the most costly tree species to retain and aspen and birch the most cost-effective. Tree species also had an impact, albeit smaller, on the cost-effectiveness of the creation of high stumps. It was most cost-effective to create high stumps from birch and aspen in southern Sweden, whereas in northern Sweden it was more cost-effective to create high stumps from pine and spruce. Therefore, when increasing the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), deciduous trees should be targeted in southern Sweden more than in the north. However, it is important that CWD is created from all tree species, because different tree species support different assemblages of saproxylic species. As regards measures that are not associated with particular tree species, retention of snags at final harvest is a cost-effective measure in all regions, whereas increasing the rotation period is costly.

AB  - We examine the relative merits of alternative forest biodiversity targets, which give different weights to species according to their conservation status and abundance. A site selection framework is used for choosing the habitat-protection strategy that maximizes biodiversity subject to an upper bound on funding with six alternative conservation goals. By using Finnish data on old-growth forests, we found that alternative conservation goals yield different benefit-cost tradeoffs. Goals relying on complementarity between protected stands result in great marginal costs at a high conservation level. Therefore, under these conditions it may not be economically efficient to establish a large conservation network to protect all species in a given area. In contrast, a large conservation network is more likely to be justified when the habitat-protection strategy focuses on species abundance. The trade-offs between alternative objectives are explicitly measured by incrementally varying the weights given to the species. We found that the targets for all species representation and species abundance can largely be met simultaneously. Protecting red-listed species reduces overall species coverage and species abundance particularly at low budget levels.

AB  - Genome sequencing of spatially distributed individuals sheds light on how evolution structures genetic variation. Populations of Phellopilus nigrolimitatus, a red-listed wood-inhabiting fungus associated with old-growth coniferous forests, have decreased in size over the last century due to a loss of suitable habitats. We assessed the population genetic structure and investigated local adaptation in P. nigrolimitatus, by establishing a reference genome and genotyping 327 individuals sampled from 24 locations in Northern Europe by RAD sequencing. We revealed a shallow population genetic structure, indicating large historical population sizes and high levels of gene flow. Despite this weak substructuring, two genetic groups were recognized; a western group distributed mostly in Norway and an eastern group covering most of Finland, Poland and Russia. This substructuring may reflect coimmigration with the main host, Norway spruce (Picea abies), into Northern Europe after the last ice age. We found evidence of low levels of genetic diversity in southwestern Finland, which has a long history of intensive forestry and urbanization. Numerous loci were significantly associated with one or more environmental factors, indicating adaptation to specific environments. These loci clustered into two groups with different associations with temperature and precipitation. Overall, our findings indicate that the current population genetic structure of P. nigrolimitatus results from a combination of gene flow, genetic drift and selection. The acquisition of similar knowledge especially over broad geographic scales, linking signatures of adaptive genetic variation to evolutionary processes and environmental variation, for other fungal species will undoubtedly be useful for assessment of the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change on fungi strongly bound to old-growth forests.

AB  - This study presents a graph-theoretical modelling approach using daily movements and habitat demands of different target bird species in an urban context to assess: 1) habitable land cover types, 2) threshold distances between patches of habitat, 3) the required minimum accessible habitat areas and 4) the effects of barriers and stepping stones. The modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden.
   The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as stepping stones and barriers were accounted for.
   Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land cover types are important. Finally, we argue that the modelling approach applied here may substantially improve landscape management and planning at scales ranging from whole landscapes down to neighbourhoods.

AB  - A main objective of game management on public lands in Norway is to ensure that harvest levels are sustainable while securing hunting access to the public. The willow ptarmigan is a popular but red-listed small game species, and it is challenging for managers to optimize harvest levels based on uncertain population estimates and limited knowledge of the factors influencing hunting impact. We studied how willow ptarmigan hunting effort, catch per unit effort, and harvest rates were influenced by ptarmigan density, topography, vegetation, and infrastructure. Data were collected during 2013-2016 from 162 hunting blocks covering 26,828km(2) state-owned land in the counties Nordland and Troms, northern Norway. Hunting effort averaged 1.27days/km(2) (SD=2.08), and it was the highest in areas close to roads and cabins. We found an opposite effect on the catch per unit effort (CPUE, mean=0.77 ptarmigan/day, SD=0.48), which was lower close to roads. There was a marked positive effect of density on CPUE, whereas terrain steepness (slope) had a negative effect. On average, harvest removed <10% of the autumn population in the hunting areas during the study period. This indicates a relatively low and partially compensatory hunting mortality in most years and areas. Although this study shows a low harvest rate, we recommend managers to survey ptarmigan populations, hunting effort, and harvest, especially in easily accessible areas close to infrastructure and in periods of low population density.

AB  - Species preservation has permeated Swedish nature conservation. Pressure recently exerted on the Swedish National Board of Forestry by environmentalists has resulted in large-scale inventories of areas ('key habitats') that contain or are assumed to contain red-listed species. 40,000 key habitat sites have been identified in forests with private ownership and a similar number is expected in company and state forests. The companies will themselves implement the inventories. Key habitat sites now appear to cover 0.8% (some 200,000 ha) of the productive forest land. The protection and management of the key habitat site is, to a large extent. left to the individual owner. The inventories considered mainly the occurrence of bryophyte. fungal and lichen species, and the population or community concepts were not taken into account. There is therefore a lack of understanding of the key habitat sites as to extinction risks, successional trends, spatial population dynamics, and community interactions. Functional sites should be identified, probably based on some especially sensitive species in the communities. Some preliminary studies in a particular key habitat demonstrate great problems for conservation, e.g. with succession, species dependence on area and on specific habitat features. and an independence of the species richness of different taxa in various sites. Many key habitat sites cannot be left without some management if the species pool is to be preserved. Therefore. it is suggested that adaptive management with large-scale experimentation with buffer zones, corridors and supply of limiting resources be adopted. At the same time monitoring appears necessary to certify the persistence of representative species.

AB  - We explored the applied use of distribution modelling as a tool for making spatial predictions of occurrences of the red-listed vascular plant species Scorzonera humilis in a study area in southeast Norway. Scorzonera is typical of extensively managed semi-natural grasslands. A Maxent model was trained on all known records of the species, accurately georeferenced and gridded to fine resolution (grid cells of 25 x 25 m). Model performance was assessed on the training data by data-splitting (by which some records were set off for evaluation) and on independent evaluation data collected in the field. Of the eight predictor variables used in the modelling, distance to roads and to arable land were most important followed by land-cover class and altitude. Judged from the area under curve (AUC), the model was good to excellent and a significant, positive relationship was found between relative probabilities of occurrence predicted by the model and true probability of presence provided by the independently collected evaluation data. The model was used together with the evaluation data to estimate presence of Scorzonera humilis in 0.7% of the grid cells in the study area. The grid cells in which the model predicted highest probability for Scorzonera to be present had a true probability of presence of ca 12%, i.e. 17 x higher than in an average cell. The present study demonstrates that, even when only simple predictor variables are available, spatial prediction modelling contributes important knowledge about rare species such as prevalence estimates, spatial prediction maps and insights into the species' autecology. Spatial prediction modelling also makes cost-efficient monitoring of rare species possible. However, it is pointed out that these benefits require evaluation of the model on independently sampled evaluation data.

AB  - Species living in metapopulations depend on connected habitat networks for their survival. If habitat networks experience fast temporal dynamics, species conservation requires preventing habitat discontinuities that could lead to metapopulation extinctions. However, few institutional solutions exist for the maintenance of spatiotemporally dynamic habitat networks outside of protected areas. To explore this often neglected problem, we studied the institutional fit of false heath fritillary (Melitaea diamina) conservation in Finland from the perspective of conservation institutions' ability to manage early successional habitat availability for this endangered species. We identified four institutional arrangements that enable effective conservation management of dynamic habitat networks: (1) acknowledgment of habitat dynamics, (2) monitoring of and responding to changes in the habitat network, (3) management of resources for fluctuating resource needs, and (4) scaling of activities through flexible collaborations. These arrangements provide the institutional flexibility needed for responding to temporal changes in habitat availability.

AB  - Increasing the prevalence of broadleaf trees in conifer-dominated production forests is a recommended means of improving habitat availability for broadleaf and mixed-forest species. The implications for biodiversity are often measured by contrasting broadleaf-conifer mixtures with conifer-dominated stands. However, few studies include broadleaf-dominated stands in these assessments. Here we contrasted the bird assemblages of even-aged production forests along a mixture gradient from Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated, to birch (Betula spp.) dominated stands in southern Sweden. We conducted point count surveys of bird individuals exhibiting breeding behaviour within 30 stands varying from <0.5% to over 98.5% broadleaf by basal area. A total of 355 birds were detected, comprising 36 bird species, seven of which are classified as near threatened by the Swedish Red-list. Our results indicate i) a distinct shift in bird community composition linked to the percentage of broadleaf trees at stand and landscape scales, ii) significantly higher bird species richness, evenness, and abundance in stands with a higher proportion of birch, iii) higher bird abundance in birch-dominated stands than in mixtures, and iv) shifts in bird species guilds as related to stand basal area, the amount of shrubs in the understory, and quantities of dead wood. All of these results have implications for the ways in which production forest management could be altered to enhance avian diversity, and we discuss these with respect to the use of broadleaf versus mixed-species stands.

AB  - A survey of the distribution and ecology of riparian beetles in Fennoscandia and adjacent countries is presented and the conservation value of, and threats to, the element are discussed. Contrary to most other taxa or ecological groups, the number of riparian species increases from south to north in Scandinavia. The inner parts of the counties of Sor-Trondelag (STI) in Central Norway and Troms (TRI) in North Norway have the largest total number of riparian species, the largest number of vulnerable (red-listed) riparian species, and the largest importance index, rarity factor and algorithmic ranking in Fennoscandia. These provinces may be regarded as hot spots for riparian species in northwestern Europe and therefore have high conservation value. In addition to river regulation, river banks are exposed to a number of impacts such as removal of sediment and fluvial woodlands, wear and tear, construction of flood-prevention walls, canalization and various other developments (road building, industrial activity, etc.). These impacts seem to be more severe in Norway than in Northern Sweden and Finland. Due to human impacts, riparian carabid beetles have become extinct in parts of their former range in Scandinavia. The possibility of re-invasion of species after restoration is discussed.

AB  - This study quantified, across a landscape in Eastern Finland, the influence of administrative land-use and technical land-form constraints on timber production. Spatially explicit data about the nature conservation areas, land use plans and steep slopes were integrated with Multi-source National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI) data. The Finnish forestry model MELA was used in the calculations related to updating forest data and estimating different scenarios of timber production with and without constraints. In the study area, the annual volume of maximum sustainable cutting removal defined for the next 30 years was decreased by one-third due to restrictions. The presented approach could be used, for example, to assess timber availability at the landscape level. Future challenges include ensuring the compatibility of spatially explicit data obtained from different sources, identifying the feasibility of forest management operations in the restricted area, and incorporating near-nature forest management operations in the forest planning system in order to estimate the timber production.

AB  - We present a rural Finnish case of nature conservation called the nature Values trade (NVT) as an example of the process of changing ecological and cultural states and preferences of environmental policy. We emphasise the importance of local ecological and Cultural circumstances for the formulation of environmental policy. The study shows how regional actors in nature conservation and forestry were able to combine forest ownership and nature conservation through authentic dialogue, and overcome a nature conservation conflict, brought about by conflicting international biodiversity goals and the Cultural preferences of landowners. Later, their ideas were included in the National Biodiversity Programme and implemented as a pilot project by regional actors, which in turn affected the ecological and cultural state of nature conservation. The NVT reflected international and large-scale trends in environmental policy, and opened new opportunities for further developing environmental policy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest exploitation has destructed forest habitats in Fermoscandia during last centuries. Vital components of existing forest biodiversity have been identified as small (a few ha) woodland key habitats (WKHs). Many WKHs in boreal forest landscapes are assumed to represent remnant near-natural forests from before the phase of industrial forest exploitation. Thus, WKHs are supposed to (i) exhibit a low degree of exploitation, (ii) have old-growth characteristics and (iii) host Red-list species. Yet, WKHs' history and biodiversity have not been systematically investigated. Thus, their conservation values remain unclear. This study investigates history and biodiversity of 15 WKHs in central Sweden with retrospective methods and field studies. We analyze (1) forest structure before, during and after the forest exploitation period, (2) existing biodiversity, i.e. species and structural elements, and (3) to what extent human activities (forestry) have influenced current biodiversity. Our results indicate that forest structure within the areas that currently are classified as WKHs has changed dramatically since the mid-19th century, when forests were unaffected by logging. The results suggest that fire-suppression during last century, gradually increased logging until mid-20th century and abandonment by modern forestry during the late 20th century, are main causes behind this transformation. Less than 10% of studied WKHs had biological features that resembled those of pristine boreal forests. Thus, most studied WKHs cannot be classified as near-natural or remnants of pristine forest. We Suggest that the program for WKHs give more focus to pre-industrial forest structure, local historical aspects being seriously regarded and ecological restoration efforts being introduced.

AB  - Effective wildlife management requires knowledge about the areas th at are most important within the distribution range or specific management unit of the focal species. Using the spatial conservation planning tool, Zonation, and spatial data on Finnish forests, we present a fast and relatively simple way to objectively prioritise large areas for our focal species, the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. We constructed the capercaillie lekking landscape prioritisation using published knowledge on the species' habitat and connectivity requirements, and validated the results via comparison to capercaillie lekking-site data. The results show that connectivity considerations both at the home range and the population scale are essential in prioritisation of areas suitable for capercaillie lekking sites. In addition, inclusion of negative connectivity to agri-urban areas further enhances the congruence between the known lekking sites and the areas of high priority (48.7% of known leks falling into the best 20% priority category). We conclude that our approach can be used in several stages of spatial wildlife conservation planning: as a preliminary analysis to find areas subjected to more detailed inventories and modelling, in combination with other analytical tools, or as the main instrument enabling informative use of readily available data in operational large-scale land-use planning. The advantages of our approach include: 1) the ability to execute relatively simple and objective analyses covering wide spatial extents at a high resolution, 2) the possibility to incorporate several ecologically realistic species-specific connectivity components into the analyses, and 3) the potential to help managers target wildlife surveys or conservation and management operations.

AB  - Building strategies for continental-scale conservation is challenging due to evolutionary and geopolitical problems. How do policy choices arise from this setting? In this study, we integrate ecological research with policy analysis to examine the problem field with a case study research. We use a violet species endemic to Europe, Viola uliginosa, as a proxy for a significant European Union (EU)-Russian biodiversity pattern and its conservation. The violet's core populations locate in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, and all populations in the EU are peripheral. The species is endangered in 12 EU member states and in decline in many places elsewhere. To analyze the choices of conservation, we gathered data on its ecology, distribution, and conservation mechanisms across Europe, putting additional emphasis on the EU enlargement and long-term site histories in Finland. We found that the survival of the species in the EU depends on the enlargement negotiations, conflicts between the EU biodiversity and agricultural policies, selection of the species to national Red Lists and the Habitats Directive, and contingent site histories depending on the conservation activities by civic actors and the member states. While the evolutionary aspect emphasizes the genetic differentiation potential of peripheral populations, the geopolitical aspect characterizes the EU as simultaneous spaces of a monotopia, borderlands, and polycentric development. We conclude that intersections between these geopolitical spaces can be used with evolutionary perspectives to identify local, European, and network-driven policy choices of conservation.

AB  - The loss of urban green space as a result of urbanization threatens the overall biodiversity of urban areas, and prompts us to consider the importance of existing urban nature more carefully. Because urban ecological systems are in intense interaction with human-social systems, it is fruitful to create an interdisciplinary research and planning framework to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity in urban areas. For this purpose, we adapted a suitable theoretical and conceptual scheme for the setting of Finnish urban development, which provides an example of a situation where a lot of nature has so far remained inside and around urban area. The adapted scheme focuses on the land use change as a result of urban land use planning and development, and may provide a way to address the important variables and feedback mechanisms between information flowing from ecological systems and drivers from the social system. Furthermore, we outlined a more specific framework around the Finnish urban detailed planning process in order to study the interactions between these systems further. After addressing ecology-oriented questions of quantity, quality and needs of urban nature, and human-oriented drivers, such as flow and incorporation of information, knowledge, values and institutions, we identified several challenges in integrating the components of ecological and social systems. Creating common conceptual ground for different actors and disciplines, improving communication in the process, matching contradictory values and perceptions, and improving stakeholder participation would be in the best interest of nature and people of urban areas.

AB  - This paper estimates the costs of producing biological diversity oil Swedish permanent grasslands. A simple model is introduced where biodiversity oil Pastures is produced using grazing animals. On the pastures, the grazing animals create a sufficient grazing pressure to lead to an environment that suits many rare and red-listed species. Two types of pastures are investigated: semi-natural and cultivated. Biological diversity produced oil a pasture is estimated by combining a biodiversity indicator, which measures the quality of the land, with the size of the pasture. Biodiversity is, in this context, a quantitative measure where a given quantity call be produced either by small area with high quality or a larger area with lower quality. Two areas in different parts of Sweden are investigated. Box-Cox transformations, which provide flexible functional forms, are used in the empirical analysis and the results indicate that the biodiversity production costs differ between the regions. The major contribution of this paper is that it develops and tests it method of estimating biodiversity production costs oil permanent pastures when biodiversity, quality differs between pastures. If the method were to be used with cost data, that were more thoroughly collected and covered additional production areas, biodiversity cost functions could be estimated and used in applied policy work.

AB  - The increasing demand for biofuels from logging residues require serious attention on the importance of dead wood substrates on clear-cuts for the many forestry-intolerant saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) species. In particular, the emerging harvest of low stumps motivates further study of these substrates. On ten clear-cuts we compared the species richness, abundance and species composition of saproxylic beetles hatching from four to nine year old low stumps, high stumps and logs of Norway spruce. By using emergence traps we collected a total of 2,670 saproxylic beetles among 195 species during the summers of 2006, 2007 and 2009. We found that the species assemblages differed significantly between high stumps and logs all three years. The species assemblages of low stumps, on the other hand, were intermediate to those found in logs and high stumps. There were also significant difference in species richness between the three examined years, and we found significant effect of substrate type on richness of predators and fungivores. As shown in previous studies of low stumps on clear-cuts they can sustain large numbers of different saproxylic beetles, including red-listed species. Our study does, in addition to this fact, highlight a possible problem in creating just one type of substrate as a tool for conservation in forestry. Species assemblages in high stumps did not differ significantly from those found in low stumps. Instead logs, which constitute a scarcer substrate type on clear-cuts, provided habitat for a more distinct assemblage of saproxylic species than high stumps. It can therefore be questioned whether high stumps are an optimal tool for nature conservation in clear-cutting forestry. Our results also indicate that low stumps constitute an equally important substrate as high stumps and logs, and we therefore suggest that stump harvesting is done after carefully evaluating measures to provide habitat for saproxylic organisms.

AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly ongoing process worldwide with profound consequences for wildlife in urban and peri-urban areas. Species are affected by habitat loss, habitat alternation and degradation, fragmentation and increased human population and activity. Habitat loss can occur due to construction of housing and infrastructure in peri-urban areas and within urban areas due to compaction. Undeveloped areas can also be changed from ruderal land, wilderness areas or leftover green space to more formal and more intensively used urban green space. This study investigated a butterfly species, the scarce copper (Lycaena virgaureae L.), in an urbanising and expanding settlement in a rural location in southern Sweden. The scarce copper is still relatively common in Sweden, but has experienced severe decline in certain areas and in other parts of Europe. Patch occupancy and abundance of the species were investigated in 44 patches ranging from urban and peri-urban to rural locations. Habitats investigated were parks, urban grasslands managed for biodiversity by the local authority, unmanaged abandoned arable sites, road verges, meadows and pastures. In total, 624 sightings of scarce coppers were recorded. The highest abundances were observed in larger unmanaged patches and in meadows in peri-urban areas, while pastures had low abundances. In urban parks, no coppers were found. The smaller sites managed for biodiversity by the local authority within the settlement were often occupied by the scarce copper, although abundances were low (mean number of individuals 3 +/- 1.2). In patches which were cut, copper numbers dropped in almost all cases to zero after cutting. Patch occupancy was affected by habitat characteristics such vegetation height, tree succession, abundance of Rumex acetosella (sheep's sorrel), as well as landscape features such as length of forest edge. Factors identified as influencing abundance were the same, but additionally also flower abundance. The current high abundances of the scarce copper in the area will not be ensured in the longer term when all building plans are implemented and no other measures are taken. Recommendations are made on management and planning to preserve the species in the study area.

AB  - Questions Aspen (Populus tremula) is declining in the old-growth forests of boreal Fennoscandia. This threatens the numerous taxa that are dependent on old aspens, including many epiphytic lichens. Potential methods to aid epiphytic lichens on aspen are centered around treatments which affect the density of Norway spruce (Picea abies). In this study, we investigated how epiphytic lichen communities on aspen are affected by the variation of spruce density in the immediate vicinity of the focal aspen. Location Southern boreal forests in Finland. Methods We recorded the occurrence of lichens from 120 aspens in 12 semi-natural forest sites. We used spruce basal area as the measure for spruce density. The selected aspens represented a gradient in spruce basal area in the vicinity of the aspen from 0 to 36 m(2)/ha. We also measured other tree- and stand-level variables that are known to influence lichen occurrence. Results Lichen communities on aspen were affected by spruce density, stand age and bark pH. Both lichen species richness and the richness of red-listed species were highest at an intermediate spruce density, and both increased with stand age. Lichen species richness was higher when bark pH was lower. Additionally, community composition was influenced the most by spruce density, followed by bark pH. Conclusions Our study highlights the detrimental effects of high spruce density on lichen diversity on aspens. This is caused by high spruce density resulting in low light availability. Lichen diversity on aspens was highest when spruce density was intermediate. Spruce thinning in aspen-rich old-growth forests can be helpful in ensuring the long-term persistence of old-growth lichens on aspen in protected forests.

AB  - Conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource production can be mitigated by multi-objective management planning. Optimizing management for multiple objectives over larger land areas likely entails trading off the practicability of the process against the goodness of the solution. It is therefore worthwhile to resolve how large areas are required as management planning regions to reconcile conflicting objectives as effectively as possible. We aimed to reveal how the extent of forestry planning regions impacts the potential to mitigate a forestry-conservation conflict in Finland, represented as a trade-off between harvest income and deadwood availability. We used forecasted data from a forest simulator, a hierarchy of forestry planning regions, and an optimization model to explore the production possibility frontier between harvest income and deadwood. We compared the overall outcomes when management was optimized within the different-sized planning regions in terms of the two objectives, the spatial variation of deadwood, and the optimal combinations of management regimes. Increasing the size of the planning regions did produce higher simultaneous levels of the two objectives, but the differences were most often of the magnitude of only a few percentages. The differences among the scales were minor also in terms of the spatial variation in deadwood availability and in the optimal management combinations. The conflict between timber harvesting and deadwood availability is only marginally easier to mitigate at large spatial scales than at small forest ownership scales. However, regardless of the spatial scale of planning, the achievable solutions may not be good enough to safeguard deadwood- dependent biodiversity without active deadwood creation.

AB  - Seminatural grasslands in Europe are susceptible to habitat destruction and fragmentation that result in negative effects on biodiversity because of increased isolation and area effects on extinction rate. However, even small habitat patches of seminatural grasslands might be of value for conservation and restoration of species richness in a landscape with a long history of management, which has been argued to lead to high species richness. We tested whether ant communities have been negatively affected by habitat loss and increased isolation of seminatural grasslands during the twentieth century. We examined species richness and community composition in seminatural grasslands of different size in a mosaic landscape in Central Sweden. Grasslands managed continuously over centuries harbored species-rich and ecologically diverse ant communities. Grassland remnant size had no effect on ant species richness. Small grassland remnants did not harbor a nested subset of the ant species of larger habitats. Community composition of ants was mainly affected by habitat conditions. Our results suggest that the abandonment of traditional land use and the encroachment of trees, rather than the effects of fragmentation, are important for species composition in seminatural grasslands. Our results highlight the importance of considering land-use continuity and dispersal ability of the focal organisms when examining the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. Landscape history should be considered in conservation programs focusing on effects of land-use change.

AB  - Ecologists have increasingly turned to history, including human history, to explain and manage modem ecosystems and landscapes. The imprint of past land use can persist even in seemingly pristine areas. Archaeology provides a long-term perspective on human actions and their environmental consequences that can contribute to conservation and restoration efforts. Case studies illustrate examples of the human history of seemingly pristine landscapes, forest loss and recovery, and the creation or maintenance of places that today are valued habitats. Finally, as archaeologists become more involved in research directed at contemporary environmental issues, they need to consider the potential uses and abuses of their findings in management and policy debates.

AB  - Cities are important sites for societal transitions towards sustainability, which is increasingly recognised around the issue of biodiversity conservation and protection. However, cities are often characterised by the need to develop and grow. Furthermore, efforts to promote sustainable development have been criticised as failing to address the fundamental causes of environmental destruction. In this article, based on interviews with bureaucrats and documentary analysis, I explore urban planning and biodiversity protection at four Swedish municipalities. Biodiversity protection has been an official goal in Sweden for 30 years. As such, my research aim is to explore how Swedish bureaucrats represent efforts to balance imperatives to develop cities and protect biodiversity. Taking an institutional approach, I identify what information is included and excluded. In assessing municipal discourse, I utilise the theory of sociocultural viability, which provides an analytical typology of four worldviews. I identify that within respondents' discourse, biodiversity primarily emerges as a product of a hierarchical view of reality, as a measurable object; an indicator; a characteristic; and as a provider that is both engineerable and replaceable. This was despite numerous respondents articulating an egalitarian desire for more holistic interpretations of biodiversity in urban planning, appreciative of its inherent worth. This suggests that biodiversity has largely been integrated into extant hierarchical conceptualisations of public administration. According to cultural theory, addressing wicked policy problems effectively requires insight from several of the typology's worldviews. As such, current practice may reiterate dominant contemporary views on nature rather than innovation towards a radically different society.

One of the main objectives of the newly reformed forest and conservation legislation is the adoption of a two-track approach - establishment of a sufficient network of nature conservation areas and an ecologically sustainable forestry. Priorities for ecological and socio-economic research in this context are suggested in the paper. The need for a proper valuation of non-wood benefits of forests is particularly emphasized.

AB  - Habitat loss and modification is one of the major threats to biodiversity and the preservation of conservation values. We use the term "conservation value" to mean the benefit of nature or habitats for species. The importance of identifying and preserving conservation values has increased with the decline in biodiversity and the adoption of more stringent environmental legislation. In this study, conservation values were considered in the context of land-use planning and the rapidly increasing demand for more accurate methods of predicting and identifying these values. We used a k-nearest neighbor interpreted satellite (Landsat TM) image classified in 61 classes to assess sites with potential conservation values at the regional and landscape planning scale. Classification was made at the National Land Survey of Finland for main tree species, timber volume, land-use type, and soil on the basis of spectral reflectance in satellite image together with broad numerical reference data. We used the number and rarity of vascular plant species observed in the field as indicators for potential conservation values. We assumed that significant differences in the species richness, rarity, or composition of flora among the classes interpreted in the satellite image would also mean a difference in conservation values among these classes. We found significant differences in species richness among the original satellite image classes. Many of the classes examined could be distinguished by the number of plant species. Species composition also differed correspondingly. Rare species were most abundant in old spruce forests (> 200 m(3)/ha), raising the position of such forests in the ranking of categories according to conservation values. The original satellite image classification was correct for 70% of the sites studied. We concluded that interpreted satellite data can serve as a useful source for evaluating habitat categories on the basis of plant species richness and rarity. Recategorization of original satellite image classification into such new conservation value categories is challenging because of the variation in species composition among the new categories. However, it does not represent a major problem for the purposes of early-stage land-use planning. Benefits of interpreted satellite image recategorization as a rapid conservation value assessment tool for land-use planners would be great.

AB  - An inventory of the two largest Swedish occurrences of the lichen Cyphelium notarisii, situated on Visingso in Smaland and at Kovik on Gotland, respectively, was conducted. A third occurrence on Faro, Gotland was discovered. A total of 21 localities were visited. Only cultural substrates such as wooden barn walls, fishing sheds and gates were utilised by fertile specimens. The species is mostly found on south- to southwest-facing walls with no shade cover, close to a water-body. The current distribution is greatly reduced compared to the historical range of the species. The major current occurrences are characterised by a high concentration of old wooden structures, which strongly indicates that measures to ensure the viability of the species' should be taken at the landscape level, rather than on individual localities. Cyphelium notarisii is reported as new to Estonia and Kazakhstan, and C. tigillare is reported as new to Gotland, Sweden.

AB  - The capercaillie has been negatively affected by the loss of mature forests. However, forestry creates young plantations offering a superabundant food supply for moose. Using two spatial scales, we tested whether the landscape-level environmental requirements of the capercaillie and moose differ. We compared the spatial association between the abundances of the two species in 50- x 50-km grids and, using a set of regression models, analyzed how it was affected by various land use variables in five regions of Finland. Both species were generally most abundant in the same grid cells. Moreover, the association between abundance and several landscape variables was very similar for both species. Forest cover had a positive impact on both species in Eastern and South-Western Finland. Only in Western Finland was the capercaillie more positively associated with older forest than the moose. Human impact variables were negatively related to both capercaillie and moose abundance in Eastern and South-Western Finland, the effect being stronger for capercaillie. In Northern Finland, human impact turned positive. Our results highlight that, on broad landscape and regional scales, we might not need to make trade-offs in management decisions concerning capercaillie and moose. While considering regional land use planning, the primary goal for both species seems to be to secure large areas of forest, preferably at a distance from human settlement.

AB  - Loss of natural forests and decline in forest biodiversity has led to several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for conservation measures is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based conservation measures commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags.
   Eight replicated sites for each of the three conservation measures were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species.
   We found larger differences in species composition between conservation measures for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the conservation measures. There was considerable variation in response to conservation measures between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides.
   Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the conservation measures, while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all conservation measures. We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies.

AB  - Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most species-rich habitats in Norway as well as in Europe. To maintain the biodiversity of hay meadows, it is important to understand local management regimes and the land use history that has shaped them and their biodiversity. There is however a general erosion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), related to hay meadows and other semi-natural habitats. This review aims to examine historical and written sources of land use practices related to hay meadows and to discuss the implications of a reintroduction of TEK in present and future management practices. Traditional land use practices and TEK obtained from written sources from four Norwegian regions and for the country as a whole are compared with present management practices. Written sources show that hay meadows have been managed in a complex but flexible way. Today's management regimes of hay meadows in Norway are streamlined and strongly simplified, most often involving only one late mowing and in some cases grazing. This simplification may result in loss of biodiversity. The potential to include more variety of management practices in hay meadows, by utilizing knowledge from written sources more systematically in combination with farmers' experienced knowledge (TEK) should be better utilized. Such an approach may secure both the biodiversity in hay meadows and TEK for the future. Former and present landscape ecological contexts in the infield-outlying land system show that management should be done for larger landscapes rather than small, isolated hay meadows, to optimize biodiversity conservation. For this study, we conducted a Norwegian literature review, based on ethnographical and ethnobotanical sources, as well as historical and present agricultural statistics, historical maps, results from research projects, and other sources. Our findings are discussed with similar European studies focusing on the historical management of hay meadows.

AB  - Safeguarding biodiversity has been one of the most important issues in the environmental and forest policies since 1990s. The problem remains in terms of decisions and knowledge on where to set appropriate conservation targets. Hence, we need detailed and reliable information about forest structure and composition and methods for estimating this information over the whole spatial domain. The approach presented aims to develop a practical tool for conservation planners and foresters to evaluate alternative conservation plans to expand and connect protected areas while identifying key forest habitats and its associated biodiversity value. In order to reach this goal and learn more about habitat quality for woodland species in boreal forests and spatial characteristics of forest landscape, we used a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multi-source Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI) Habitat quality assessment and suitability snaps constitute a useful approach for designing management plans to improve biodiversity conservation. In this chapter, we present an approach and tools for assessing biodiversity values in both managed and protected forest areas. The approach is intended to assist decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats and management of natural resources. The different habitat quality models presented are used as a surrogate for biodiversity value. The indicators and the models developed reflect a sound scientific basis that can be implemented in other European countries that invest in national forest inventories. Within this framework, focusing on forests in Finland and on end-user needs, this effort constitutes the first attempt undertaken at the landscape level to use National Forest Inventory data for forest biodiversity monitoring and management.

AB  - In this study, we present an approach for the identification of indicators for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. We analyze the data of stands of pure Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), as well as mixed P. abies-F. sylvatica forests in the Solling mountains (NW Germany). The analysis is based on 683 vegetation samples in total. For different plant groups, that is, vascular plants, bryophytes, Red List species, we investigate species numbers as a parameter of biodiversity. Species numbers are differentiated into three classes to describe low to high diversity. Plots are separately examined for the three different forest types. In order to take the species-area relationship into account, we only use releves with a plot size of 100 m(2). Our approach focuses on the probability to be in a defined range of species numbers, that is, class, if a certain species occurs. For the purpose of facilitating the differentiation of the classes, we use the presence values of species in the classes for further characterization of indicators. Few indicators were found for the low ranges of species numbers. In addition, there were only a small number of species groups and stand types having indicators for all three classes. Various species have multiple indicator functions, e.g., with regard to the investigated species groups. The focus on a few of these multi-indicators allows a rapid assessment of forest biodiversity. The catalog of indicators resulting from the investigation helps to facilitate and accelerate biodiversity evaluations of forest stands, in particular with regard to nature conservation and the restoration of natural forests.

AB  - We modelled presence/absence per tree of beetles and pseudoscorpions living in tree hollows in relation to trunk circumference, habitat openness, and connectivity (= density of hollow oaks in the surrounding area), using data from 281 oaks. The presence/absence models were then used to predict species' occurrences in a county (11,600 km(2)) in southeastern Sweden. For eight of the nine species, the most parsimonious occupancy model included a positive relationship with connectivity and at least one tree characteristic. Occupancy underestimates from occurrence records-the ratio of the area of occupancy based on our predictive model to the area of occupancy based on occurrence records-varied between 3 and 83 among species when using occurrence records up to 1993, with significantly larger underestimates for smaller beetle species. Today (after extensive surveys), underestimation has decreased to 1.3-25, confirming that calculations solely based on species occurrence records greatly underestimate the area of occupancy. We suggest this should be taken into account to a greater extent and in a clearer way than today when constructing red lists. The radius of the connectivity measure that generated the best fit varied between 135 and 2,857 m among species, with longer distances for more threatened species. Consequently, preservation of the most threatened species (Elater ferrugineus and Tenebrio opacus) requires conservation efforts at larger spatial scales than required to protect Osmoderma eremita, which frequently has been used as an indicator and umbrella species.

AB  - Impaired ecosystems are converted back to natural ecosystems or some other target stage by means of restoration and management. Due to their agricultural legacy, afforested fields might be valuable compensatory habitats for rare fungal species that require nutrient-rich forest soils. Using a large-scale field experiment in Finland, we studied community composition of macrofungi (agarics and boletes) on former fields, which had been afforested as monocultures 20 years ago using native spruce Picea abies, pine Pinus sylvestris, and birch Betula pendula. We studied the effect of soil quality, tree species, and site on community composition and structure. Many nutrient-demanding as well as rare fungal species were recorded, particularly from pine and spruce plots. Pine plots supported more nutrient-demanding fungi than birch plots. There was no relationship between soil pH, bulk density, P, N, or Ca, and species richness of nutrient-demanding fungi. Fungal community composition was more similar within sites than among sites for all tree species. Among sites, spruce plots had the smallest fungal species turnover, and birch plots largest. Within sites, however, fungal species turnover from plot to plot was similar among tree species. Our results indicate that tree species has a relatively mild influence on species composition of fungi after 20 years of succession. Interestingly, the results show that afforested fields can be valuable complementary habitats for rare, red-listed, and nutrient-demanding fungal species. Field afforestation is a potential conservation tool that could be used to complement the poor representation of rare habitat types in highly fragmented protected area networks.

AB  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNING NATURE GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNANCE) Industrialisation, urbanisation and modernisation in the Nordic countries have contributed to environmental problems reflected in declining !mothversity and landscapes classified as wilderness. In 1967 and 1972, Sweden and Norway respectively developed national policies on environmental protection and new systems of environmental government to solve the new environmental problems. The political goal in both countries was to make a national public sector of governing the envircmment with coordination and planning. The article is an empirical qualitative case study of national governing and regional management of the environment in both countries The geographic, demographic and systemKey words: ecological challenges are the same in the north in the counties of Nordland in Norway and Norrbotten in Sweden. We used comparative methods to investigate the different patterns of organisation of regional management of the environment The research question is: What are the differences in regional management, coordination and integration of national environmental policy between Norway and Sweden) The empirical case study and comparison shows that while the Swedish system of governing is integrated <'top-down", the Norwegian system is more a governance system that is disintegrated and.bottom-up". The policy in Sweden offers stronger conservation of nature and larger biodiversity compared with Norway. The data show that orgamsanon of governing and management institutions is important in resolving global environmental problems

AB  - Habitat use studies provide invaluable information for the conservation of species that suffer from habitat loss or degradation. We used satellite telemetry to study the habitat use of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in relation to six habitat classes (artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests, semi-natural areas, wetlands and waterbodies) and five forest age classes (0-9, 10-19, 20-59, 60-99 and >= 100 years old) during the post-fledging period in Finland. The post-fledging period, defined here as the period between fledging and dispersal from the natal area, is a critical life-history stage. Our primary objective was to provide information that could be integrated into landscape planning, including wind-energy development (which poses a threat to white-tailed eagles). We found that the habitat classes that were selected by the young white-tailed eagles were forests, semi-natural areas (i.e., transitional woodland and bare rock) and wetlands. When using forests, the eagles selected stands of 0-9 years old, presumably due to the use of retention trees surrounded by a clear-cut as perching sites. Conversely, the habitat classes that were avoided were artificial surfaces, agricultural areas and (the immediate vicinity of) waterbodies. We conclude that the conversion of natural habitats into built and agricultural areas is detrimental to young white-tailed eagles because it reduces habitat availability. They, however, appear to be capable of using forests recently impacted by forestry if perch trees are present. Careful landscape planning is needed to protect priority habitats and avoid conflicts with an expanding white-tailed eagle population (e.g., by building wind farms in areas already environmentally disturbed).

AB  - Local participation has evolved as a strategy in the conservation and maintenance of biological and cultural values in cultural landscapes. The meaning(s) of the concept, however, are fuzzy. and conditions for fruitful implementation have only been investigated to a limited extent. In this article, a couple of Swedish cases serve as points of departure for a better understanding of the prerequisites and critical aspects as regards an increased local involvement in landscape management. A review of research on community participation reveals some essential aspects; power relations, participants. the institutional framework, organisation, communication, knowledge building, monitoring and contextual factors. These aspects have formed the structure for the analysis of two cases within which local involvement is considered successful; Southern Oland, where community involvement in seminatural grassland management has been experienced in LIFE-projects and in the process of becoming a UNESCO World heritage site, and Malarhagar, an integrated restoration and beef production project carried out in close collaboration with farmers. The results are discussed in terms of successful ingredients, counterproductive aspects and operational difficulties. The findings show that trust, communication and local influence are vital ingredients in a participatory approach. Communication and co-management are pointed out as central areas of competence for executives working with landscape management and planning. There are, however, collisions between directives concerning nature conservation and directives concerning public participation. For successful local involvement, the subject for collaboration has to be broadly defined. Furthermore, the strong emphasis on collaboration in participatory approaches demands that democratic aspects have to be considered. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The intensification of coastal development poses potential threats for coastal seabirds, and understanding their habitat use is a key factor to guide conservation and management. In sub-arctic areas, black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) use coastal habitats year-round, which makes them vulnerable to the increasing human activities in these areas. In mainland Norway, one of the species' strongholds, black guillemots are red-listed after substantial population declines. However, their fine-scale foraging behaviour has received little attention to date. We collected and analysed GPS tracking data from adult black guillemots at three sites located over a latitudinal gradient of 250 km in central/northern Norway. Maximum foraging ranges of 33 km at Sklinna (65 degrees 12 ' N) for incubating birds, and 18 km at both Vega (65 degrees 34 ' N) and Sklinna for chick-rearing birds, are among the longest reported for this species. At all three sites, foraging probability was highest in shallow waters (< 50 m depth) close to the colony and declined with increasing water depth and distance from colony. However, birds from Vega also foraged over deeper waters. Kelp presence was of high importance at Sklinna, but apparently less important at Rost (67 degrees 26'N) and Vega. We also found distinct differences in foraging activity across the day and with tidal height among the sites. Inter-site differences in habitat use and foraging activity may be explained by differences in the availability of habitats and suitable prey. Our study highlights the importance of shallow marine areas for black guillemots and shows that habitat use can vary substantially between sites.

AB  - Modern forestry management has reduced the amount of dead wood in forest ecosystems and this has become a serious threat to flora and fauna. Efforts are therefore being made to reverse this trend but one problem is that we still tack detailed knowledge regarding the substrate requirements of many saproxylic species. In a field experiment, conducted in three forest types (forest reserve, mature managed forest and clear-cut), we evaluated the value, from a conservation perspective, of different substrate types (logs, snags and tops) of Norway Spruce, Picea abies, and if the quality of spruce Logs as saproxylic habitats can be improved by simple log treatments (scorching and shading). We collected 9982 individuals representing 262 saproxylic beetle species in window traps. Both substrate type and, to a lesser extent, log treatment had a significant effect on the abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles attracted to the different dead wood substrates. However, more importantly, the composition of the beetle assemblages differed significantly between both substrates and log treatments. Snags, logs and tops all attracted significantly different beetle assemblages and scorched togs differed from untreated control togs. Sixteen red listed species were trapped, with the highest number (11 species) being found on scorched togs. We found strong evidence that some species preferred a specific substrate type, mainly togs, in some cases treated togs (scorched or shaded), but not snags, the substrate commonly provided for conservation purposes on e.g. clear-cuts. This stresses the importance of conducting forestry in such a way that a multitude of both forest habitats and dead wood substrates are available continuously in the forest landscape to maintain biodiversity.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors on species richness and species composition may be manifested at different spatial levels. Exploring these relationships is important to understand at which spatial scales certain species and organism groups become sensitive to fragmentation and changes in habitat quality. At different spatial scales we evaluated the potential influence of 45 factors (multiple regression, PCA) on saproxylic oak beetles in 21 smaller broadleaved Swedish forests of conservation importance (woodland key habitats, WKH). Local amount of dead wood in forests is often assumed to be important, but two landscape variables, area of oak dominated woodland key habitats within 1 km of sites and regional amount of dead oak wood, were the main (and strong) predictors of variation in local species richness of oak beetles. The result was similar for red-listed beetles associated with oak. Species composition of the beetles was also best predicted by area of oak woodland key habitat within 1 km, with canopy closure as the second predictor. Despite suitable local quality of the woodland key habitats, the density of such habitat patches may in many areas be too low for long-term protection of saproxylic beetles associated with broadleaved temperate forests. Landscapes with many clustered woodland key habitats rich in oak should have high priority for conservation of saproxylic oak beetles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a new method for ecologically sustainable land use planning within multiple land use schemes. Our aims were (1) to develop a method that can be used to locate important areas based on their ecological values; (2) to evaluate the quality, quantity, availability, and usability of existing ecological data sets; and (3) to demonstrate the use of the method in Eastern Finland, where there are requirements for the simultaneous development of nature conservation, tourism, and recreation. We compiled all available ecological data sets from the study area, complemented the missing data using habitat suitability modeling, calculated the total ecological score (TES) for each 1 ha grid cell in the study area, and finally, demonstrated the use of TES in assessing the success of nature conservation in covering ecologically valuable areas and locating ecologically sustainable areas for tourism and recreational infrastructure. The method operated quite well at the level required for regional and local scale planning. The quality, quantity, availability, and usability of existing data sets were generally high, and they could be further complemented by modeling. There are still constraints that limit the use of the method in practical land use planning. However, as increasing data become available and open access, and modeling tools improve, the usability and applicability of the method will increase.

AB  - Despite well-formulated goals for environmental protection in the forestry sector, the biodiversity crisis remains. Protected habitats are often small, isolated and lack continuity. We studied forest planning at a landscape scale as a method to increase habitat connectivity, and improve conservation values whilst maintaining high levels of forest production. We assessed the financial impacts of landscape planning for the landowners, and present a fee-fund system to solve unequal burdens among them. As case studies, we used three landscapes along a latitudinal gradient in Sweden. The results demonstrate some variation between the landscapes in terms of the total cost for set asides and large differences in terms of the financial impact per landowner. Our conclusion is that forest landscape planning may be a way forward to improve conservation efforts, but given the variation in financial impacts, we propose to combine landscape planning with economic tools for compensation.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important habitat for many species in forest ecosystems. However, forestry has decreased the abundance of CWD so that many wood-dependent species have become threatened. To alleviate this problem, guidelines for a more biodiversity-oriented forestry focus on increasing CWD in managed forests. Unfortunately, how this increase is to be allocated on a landscape scale is not well understood. The present study reports an experiment in which freshly cut logs of varying sizes were placed in stands with contrasting abundance of natural CWD and subsequently varying pools of wood-inhabiting species. The first six years of colonization by wood fungi show that local abundance and composition of the fungal flora strongly influenced colonization. Higher species richness was observed in CWD-rich sites, and several species were more frequent on the experimental logs at CWD-rich sites. The strong within-site effect is interpreted as resulting from high spore deposition from the local species pool. This is supported by spore deposition estimates of Fomitopsis rosea, a red-listed species that only occurred on experimental logs at the CWD-rich sites. F. rosea had a 9-180 times higher spore deposition at the CWD-rich sites compared to the CWD-poor sites. The species richness and composition on small logs differed from that of large logs with higher richness on the latter. The results strongly suggest that restoration efforts would be more efficient if directed toward sites close to CWD-rich sites and that preferably large logs should be created.

AB  - The sea area around the Orkney archipelago, Scotland is subjected to substantial maritime shipping activities. By contract, the Svalbard archipelago, Norway currently has a rather low marine traffic profile. Future projections, however, indicate that the Trans-Arctic route might change the whole transportation picture and Svalbard may be at the centre of maritime activities. Both archipelagos have sensitive environmental resources at sea and inland, including bird communities. There are, for instance, 13 Red Listed species present in Orkney and 2 in Svalbard. In this regard, it is important to address oil spill risks along existing and projected shipping routes. Hypothetical spills were simulated in twelve scenarios for both the Orkney and Svalbard archipelagos with the OpenDrift open-source software. The results indicate risks to seabird communities. For Orkney, the spills resulted in the most extensive contamination of the sea and land environments in autumn. For Svalbard, autumn spills on the contrary presented the lowest risk to seabirds. Based on the simulations, we recommend increased caution for shipping activities in the problematic seasons, improved local readiness for ship accidents and sufficient preincident planning.

AB  - 1. The availability and quantity of observational species occurrence records have greatly increased due to technological advancements and the rise of online portals, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), coalescing occurrence records from multiple datasets. It is well-established that such records are biased in time, space and taxonomy, but whether these datasets differ in relation to origin have not been assessed. If biases are specific to different types of datasets, and the relative contribution from these datasets have changed over time, these shifting biases will have implications for interpretations of results and, consequentially, for management and conservation measures. 2. We examined observational GBIF records from Norway to test potential differences in taxonomic, time and land-cover biases between 10 different datasets, with a focus on red-listed and non-native species. 3. The datasets differ in their taxonomic coverage, with datasets dominated by citizen scientist recorders focusing greatly on birds. The number of records has increased over time; in particular, citizen science datasets have had a sharp increase in recent years. 4. The different datasets (including division of the datasets by conservation status) showed differences in geographical coverage. Anthropogenic land covers have more records than would be expected by chance in the majority of cases. Remote areas have fewer records than would be expected, underlining the prevalence of a roadside bias. 5. Accounting for biases in opportunistic species occurrence records need to be a dynamic rather than static process, as the taxonomic and geographical biases have changed over time and differ between datasets, depending on origin and inherent characteristics. Data-collection programmes should be designed to counteract the biases of the specific datasets, and methods to account for the biases in existing data should be developed. When utilizing compiled, open-source data, care must be taken to ensure complementarity between the datasets, both regarding time and space. Incorporating strengths and accounting for biases between datasets can strengthen the integration between species occurrence records with different origins for science-policy impact and management.

AB  - We apply a recently developed conservation prioritization method (Zonation algorithm) to a national-scale conservation planning task. The Finnish Forest and Park Service (Metsahallitus) was given the mandate to expand the current protected areas in southern Finland by 10 000 ha. The question is which areas should be selected out of the total area of 1 760 000 ha. The data available include a nation-wide GIS data set describing general features of forests at the resolution of 25 m x 25 m for entire Finland and another data set about biodiversity features within the current state-managed conservation areas. Ecologically, the key information includes forest age and the volume of growing stock for 20 forest types representing different productivity classes and dominant tree species. Our analysis employs four different connectivity components to identify forest areas that are (i) locally of high quality and internally well connected, (ii) well connected to surrounding high-quality forests, (iii) well connected to existing conservation areas, and (iv) large enough to allow efficient implementation. Expert evaluation of the results suggested that the present quantitative analysis was helpful in identifying areas with high conservation value systematically across southern Finland. Our analysis also showed that the highest forest conservation potential in Finland is located on privately owned land. The present techniques can be applied to many large-scale planning and management projects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Russian forest policy stipulates that intensified wood production is part of sustainable forest management. Swedish forest practices form a role model for this ambition. However, are the biophysical conditions for tree growth the same in northwest (NW) Russia and Sweden? We compared growth rates of young Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies H. Karst.) at 58 degrees, 60 degrees, 62 degrees, 64 degrees N in both countries. Stands on rich, mesic and poor sites were sampled using the intercept method as an indicator of the actual tree growth rate. Young Scots pine growth did not differ between NW Russia and Sweden, and should thus, if managed in the same way, have the same rate of wood production. However, for Norway spruce growth rates were 20 per cent lower in Russia than in Sweden. This was linked to few young spruce trees growing without removing competing deciduous trees in Russia. All Swedish stands had been pre-commercial cleaned, but this treatment had only been applied to 5 per cent of the Russian stands. We discuss that intensification towards sustainable forest management requires knowledge not only about forest ecology, but also a toolbox for governance, planning and management. This requires learning about societal development trajectories linked to ownership, governance and tenure systems as well as forest landscape history.

AB  - Setting aside forest land is practiced globally and is of vital importance to the preservation of forest biodiversity. As detailed species inventories rarely precede the establishment of set-asides, empirical studies on the species content of different set-aside types are needed, in order to evaluate their conservation relevance and to design efficient conservation strategies. Here, we compared the biodiversity value per unit area of three types of set-asides, common in boreal Europe: nature reserves, key habitats and retention groups on clear-cuts, and we also included old managed forests as reference sites. We surveyed bryophytes on all substrates and lichens growing on spruce in spruce-dominated forests in middle boreal Sweden and in total 252 bryophytes and 176 lichens were found. For bryophytes the number of species, as well as the number of red-listed species, per unit area was higher in key habitats than in retention groups and old managed forests, while intermediate in nature reserves. As the complementarity between areas was greatest in key habitats, the total number of bryophyte species found was by far the highest in this set-aside type. For lichens the patterns were similar but the differences much less pronounced. Site selection methods based on linear programming demonstrated that key habitats also played the most important role in representing the surveyed taxa effectively but that the value of nature reserves increased when multiple representations of each species were required. The study shows that the richness and composition of bryophytes and lichens differ between the three set-aside types and consequently, the outcome of large-scale conservation strategies based on anyone type would be different. At present, key habitats stand out as core areas of high diversity in the forest landscape but it is important also to acknowledge the temporal dynamics of the forest landscape and how the capacity of each set-aside type to host species can be expected to change over time.

AB  - Road and railroad verges may contribute to nature conservation by providing habitat for many species, but due to limited resources, there is a need to select the most important road and railroad stretches for adapted management. We explore the responsibility species concept as a tool for the Swedish Transport Administration to make this selection. We propose lists of candidate responsibility species based on relative abundance of conservation priority species in the vicinity of roads and railroads, respectively. Abundance data were derived from crowd-sourced species observations. Species with >= 20% of observations in infrastructure habitats were included as candidate responsibility species. For roads 32 species were included in the list, for railroads seven species, with an overlap of three species between the lists. We analyzed habitat and management requirements of the listed species to try identifying functional groups. Most of the species require open or semi-open habitats, mainly dry grassland or heathland on sandy or limy soil, un-sprayed crop fields, or solitary trees. Host plants or substrates include broom (genus Genista), patches of bare soil, and sun exposed wood. Conservation actions prescribed for the species include, e.g., late or irregular mowing, removal of the field layer, planting of host species, protecting and providing particular substrates, and special protection of certain sites. We argue that road and railroad managers are particularly well suited to conduct most of these actions. We consider the responsibility species concept to be a useful tool for transportation agencies to set priorities for adapted verge management, and the current method to be effective in identifying a first list of candidate species. We discuss the possibility of also identifying responsibility habitats or general management measures based on the results.

AB  - We aim to provide a long-term ecological analysis of land-use and floristic diversity in the transition from traditional to modern land-use management in the time a.d. 1800-2008 in southern Sweden. We use the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model to quantify land-cover changes on a regional scale at 20-year intervals, based on the fossil pollen record. Floristic richness and evenness are estimated using palynological richness and the Shannon index applied to the REVEALS output, respectively. We identified a transition period of 60 years between 1880 and 1940 when the total tree cover increased and the tree composition changed from deciduous to coniferous dominance. Within the shrinking area of open land, arable land taxa expanded, while the number and coverage of herbs in the remaining grasslands decreased. The succession from open grasslands to more tree-covered habitats initially favoured palynological richness, which reached its highest values during the first 40 years of the transition period. The highest REVEALS-based evenness was recorded in the time of traditional land-use and at the beginning of the transition period, reflecting higher habitat diversity at these time intervals. Our results support a more dynamic ecosystem management that changes between traditional land-use and phases of succession (< 40 years) to promote floristic diversity. We have developed and applied a palaeoecological methodology that contributes realistic estimates to be used in ecosystem management.

AB  - In the management of protected nature areas, arguments are being raised for increasingly integrated approaches. Despite an explicit ambition from the responsible managing governmental agencies, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and Swedish National Heritage Board, attempts to initiate and increase the degree of integrated nature and cultural heritage conservation management in the Swedish mountains are failing. The delivery of environmental policy through the Swedish National Environmental Objective called Magnificent Mountains is dependent on increased collaboration between the state and local stakeholders. This study, using a group model building approach, maps out the system's dynamic interactions between nature perceptions, values and the objectives of managing agencies and local stakeholders. It is identified that the dominance of a wilderness discourse influences both the objectives and management of the protected areas. This wilderness discourse functions as a barrier against including cultural heritage conservation aspects and local stakeholders in management, as wilderness-influenced objectives are defining protected areas as environments "untouched" by humans. A wilderness objective reduces the need for local knowledge and participation in environmental management. In reality, protected areas depend, to varying degrees, on the continuation of traditional land-use practices.

AB  - Radioactive contamination of agricultural land may necessitate long-term changes in food production systems, through application of selected countermeasures, in order to reduce the accumulation of radionuclides in food. We quantified the impact of selected countermeasures on habitat diversity, using the hypothetical case of two agricultural areas in Finland. The management scenarios studied were conversions from grassland to cereal production and from grassland and crop production to afforestation. The two study sites differed with respect to present agricultural production: one being predominantly cereal production and seminatural grasslands, while the other was dominated by intensive grass and dairy production. Some of the management scenarios are expected to affect landscape structures and habitat diversity. These potential changes were assessed using a spatial pattern analysis program in connection with geographic information systems. The studied landscape changes resulted in a more monotonous landscape structure compared to the present management. by increasing the mean habitat patch size, reducing the total habitat edge length and reducing the overall habitat diversity calculated by the Shannon diversity index. The degree of change was dependent on the present agricultural management practice in the case study sites. Where dairy production was predominant, the landscape structure changes were mostly due to conversion of intensive pastures and grasslands to cereal production. In the area dominated by cereal production and seminatural grasslands, the greatest predicted impacts resulted from afforestation of meadows and pastures. The studied management changes are predicted to reduce biodiversity at the species level as well as diminishing species-rich habitats. This study has predicted prominent side effects in habitat diversity resulting from application of management scenarios. These potential long-term impacts should be considered by decision-makers when planning future strategies in the event of radionuclide deposition.

AB  - Key message The ICP Forests network can be a platform for large-scale mycorrhizal studies. Mapping and monitoring of mycorrhizas have untapped potential to inform science, management, conservation and policy regarding distributions, diversity hotspots, dominance and rarity, and indicators of forest changes.
   Context A dearth of information about fungi at large scales has severely constrained scientific, forest management, fungal conservation and environmental policy efforts worldwide. Nonetheless, fungi fulfil critical functional roles in our changing environments and represent a considerable proportion of terrestrial biodiversity. Mycorrhizal fungi are increasingly viewed as a major functional guild across forest ecosystems, and our ability to study them is expanding rapidly.
   Aims This study aimed to discuss the potential for starting a mycorrhizal monitoring programme built upon the existing forest monitoring network, raise questions, propose hypotheses and stimulate further discussion.
   Results An overview of the state-of-the-art regarding forest ectomycorrhizal ecology raises questions and recommendations for scaling up mycorrhizal assessments aimed at informing a variety of stakeholders, with a new focus on conservation and policy.
   Conclusion Fungal research and conservation are areas that can be informed by ICP Forests and may lead to useful spin-offs; research linked to long-term forest monitoring plots will enhance the relevance of science and conservation.

AB  - The epiphytic lichen species richness and community composition was compared for 600 living trees distributed within the interior of 60 Scots pine and Norway spruce monoculture stands in southern Sweden. A higher species richness, and more unique species, was found on trees of Scots pine than of Norway spruce, and distinctive communities were associated with the two tree species. Lichen species composition also shifted between the 30-, 55- and 80-year-old stands, although there was no significant difference in species richness between the different age classes. Tree species and age of the stand explained most of the variation in community composition (41%), with additional variance explained by lichen proximity to the ground (6%) and aspect (1%) (northern/southern side of trunk). Scots pine and Norway spruce share many attributes, such as both being conifers with acidic bark properties and having a similar geographical distribution in Fennoscandia. However, our study showed that species richness and community composition can nevertheless diverge in stands dominated by these two tree species. Since the occurrence of red-listed species was low in these stands, we suggest that 80-year rotations are not long enough for the occurrence of the many rare and specialized lichen species that require old forest structures and long forest continuity in this region.

AB  - Detailed knowledge on habitat requirements is a key to successful conservation actions. The marbled jewel beetle Poecilonota variolosa (Buprestidae) has a wide global distribution but populations are often scarce and typically fragmented. In Sweden it is monophagous on aspen Populus tremula and is classified as near threatened on the Swedish Red List due to its rapid population decline. This study aimed to investigate habitat preferences and regional-scale distribution patterns of P. variolosa in southern Sweden in order to suggest conservation measures. Aspen trees in four study areas in the province of SmAyenland were surveyed for exit holes during late summer 2011. The occurrence and number of exit holes (both new and old ones) per tree were compared between study areas and habitat types, and were related to the sun exposure and bark thickness of individual trees. Further, the occurrence of new and older exit holes was related to tree sun exposure and bark thickness. The most preferred habitat types were aspens on clear-cuts, followed by roadside aspens, aspens in pastures, and aspens in closed forest. Thick bark and high sun exposure were consistently significant as predictors for both occurrence and number of new exit holes per tree. The majority of exit holes were located towards south. Our results indicate several useful management measures: to retain aspen on clear-cuts, to cut alongside roads and around some selected coarse aspens in closed forests and in pastures.

AB  - In Sweden, the maintenance of biological diversity is considered a key element in the development towards a sustainable society. However, the link between sustainable development and biodiversity is far from clear to everybody. It is an important task to explain this link. A cornerstone of Swedish biodiversity policy is that each sector in society has a sectoral responsibility to ensure that its own activities do not cause any long-term loss of biodiversity (but instead help to maintain it). The concept of sectoral responsibility is an important feature of environmental policy in the context of developing new incentives. Besides 'traditional' nature conservation tools - such as the protection of sites, purchasing land and general environmental legislation - new, more market-oriented incentives have emerged during the last few years, e.g. certifications schemes in forestry and eco-labelling in agriculture. These new incentives have developed alongside political processes (parliament, government, agencies etc.) and have been formulated and negotiated by 'market players'. Environmental NGOs, such as WWF Sweden and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, have often taken the lead role in this process. Another feature of these incentives is that they not only apply to products but also to production; an example of this is in forestry where not just the wood but also forest management are in focus. The national agri-environmental programmes, within the context of the European Union's subsidy programme for environmental measures in agriculture, provide a powerful tool for conserving and enhancing biodiversity. In Sweden at least, there is nowadays complete acceptance for the basic view that it is both desirable and necessary to pay the farmers for their 'production' of common benefits such as biodiversity in well-managed pastures and meadows. Market-oriented incentives, such as eco-labelling and certification schemes, have an important role to play and should complement other, more traditional tools such as general environmental legislation and protection of sites.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are among the most vulnerable ones, suffering from increasing pressure through multiple resource use, pollution, and global environmental change. Maintenance of biodiversity in land and marine environments located in coastal zones requires more than protected areas and nature conservation programmes. The approaches to integrated management in many countries allow for new initiatives to combine biodiversity management with human resource use and production activities. At present a nation-wide research programme for sustainable coastal zone management is carried out in Sweden. In this programme new ways to coastal biodiversity management are discussed with the aim of integrating natural resource use and maintenance of biodiversity at the coast. Such ideas can be analysed in frameworks like ecological restoration of coastal habitats ol participatory resource management with active involvement of stakeholders and resource users. Both approaches emphasise the human and social components of biodiversity management - in contrast to traditional conservation which is oriented to the biophysical basis and legal regulation through a protection status (a status given to nearly 400,000 ha of land and water along the more than 7000 km of the Swedish coastline). The Swedish research programme has a human ecology component in theoretical and in empirical research aiming at managerial knowledge for natural resource management.

AB  - Some trees are commonly retained as a conservation measure during forest harvest. However, their actual contribution to maintaining biodiversity is poorly known. In Swedish forests, aspen Populus tremula supports a rich epiphytic flora. The bryophyte Antitrichia curtipendula and the lichen Lobaria pulmonaria, used in forest inventories as indicators of long forest continuity and presence of red-listed species, were used in a transplantation experiment. Transplants on groups of retained aspen trees in clearcuts were compared with transplants on scattered trees in clearcuts and on aspens in uncut mature forests. The survival and 'vitality' of a total of 2240 transplants were recorded 20-25 months after transplantation, where 89% of the lichen transplants remained, as compared with 99% for the bryophyte. Both species had high vitality in clearcuts, although the bryophyte was most vital in the forest. The lichen had significantly higher vitality on groups of trees as compared with scattered ones. Vitality was significantly higher on the north than on the south sides of retained trees for both species. The results indicate that retained trees can form biodiversity links during forest succession after final harvest and that they are beneficial to at least some species considered to be sensitive to forest operations.

AB  - Rural land-use planning should handle land-use interests, such as nature-based tourism, biodiversity preservation and industrial resource extraction, on an appropriate level of scale. Management for multifunctionality represents an option in factually multifunctional landscapes. The Swedish policy of national interests, as applied in the context of the three northernmost municipalities? statutory comprehensive plan-making, provides an attempt in this direction. Based on mapping and practitioner interviews, the study reveals that the vague ?practical? implications of the omnipresent land-use designations under the policy complicate the task of local-level spatial planning. Integrated consideration of multiple uses (or use options), implicated by policy principles, was found to fall back into case-by-case assessments. Land-use designation can be worked into a tool for the governance of multifunctional landscapes when care is taken to manage the aspects outlined in the study, among others interagency orchestration and explicit regulation of co-existence.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation resulting mainly from increased human impacts related to land use represent considerable threats to biodiversity. When regional ecological security is threatened, governments attempt to regulate unreasonable behavior via policies and laws. China has a dominant forestry industry, and the country is attempting to implement the dual goals of economic development and ecological security; therefore, the Chinese government has formulated a series of policies and regulations to balance these goals. This study presents the main forest policies in China and implements a logistic regression model to analyze the changes in forest land in the study area (Jiangxi Province) and the primary influencing factors for these changes under the forest policies from 1990 to 2010. Subsequently, a forest fragmentation model (non-traditional forest landscape pattern index) was built to analyze the forest fragmentation patterns and interference modes. The results indicated that the total forest land area increased by more than 40,000 ha during the study period; however, the logistic model showed that a large amount of high-quality forest land was replaced by poor-quality forest land because forest land areas that present rich soil organic matter (SOM) content are more easily converted to other land types, whereas areas with poor SOM are more easily converted to forest land. Between 1990 and 2010, forest fragmentation improved because the proportion of interior forests increased and the proportions of patch and perforated forests decreased. The paper concludes by proposing some policy recommendations for the conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB  - This study examined the knowledge of and attitudes towards nature conservation. A questionnaire enquiring about aspects related to education, land-holdings and attributes was answered by 393 Swedish non-industrial private forest owners. Attendance on the National Board of Forestry's educational programmes, self-estimated knowledge about conservation and knowledge about forest species were all related to a positive attitude towards conservation. Education in forestry was related to knowledge of conservation, but not to the attitude towards it. Dependence on income from the forest, age > 55 yrs and a land-use-related occupation, all indicated a less positive attitude. Compared with men, women were less active owners with less forestry education, but younger women with high formal education had the most positive attitude of all. The results suggest that forest owners should be encouraged to attend regularly updated courses, and that courses should be available for non-active owners on how to put a pro-environmental attitude into practice.

AB  - Intensive forest management and landscape degradation are threats to amphibian populations. We modelled and compared the extinction and colonization dynamics of the great crested newt in four different spatial contexts that describe landscape change from past to present and future forest landscapes in eastern Finland. In future landscape scenarios, we explored the effects of two forest use intensities with different logging rotation times. The introduction of fish into breeding ponds has been the main cause of local extinctions of the great crested newt. In the future, intensifying land-use and shorter logging rotation will decrease the connectivity between ponds the most. In conservation planning, more attention should be paid to the spatial arrangement of habitat patches, especially if the intensity of human impact will increase. Conservation effort must be targeted towards securing source ponds in the core area and towards enhancing connectivity.

AB  - This paper looks at the strategies needed for the conservation and sustainable use of some of Europe's most fragile ecosystems: mountain habitats. Despite their appearance as wildscape, many traditional mountain ecosystems are semi-natural habitats whose character has been shaped by past forms of land use management. In some cases, this symbiosis has evolved over many centuries, even millennia, giving a deceptive natural stability to the ecosystems involved. However, as mountain areas across Europe have been drawn into more specialised forms of farm production, the progressive abandonment of traditional husbandry practices, including range grazing by livestock, has led to a reduction and fragmentation of those ecosystems and to the loss of key species within them. Using two sample mountain areas, the Scottish Highlands and Jotunheimen of Norway, this paper focuses on how the presence of particular ecosystems and species needs to be seen within a specific rather than generalised framework of traditional land use management. It will reconstruct this framework, highlighting the differences between the two sample areas and showing how their traditional resource management has contributed to the ecological dynamics of traditional mountain habitats. Drawing on detailed field data at both a community and species level, it will highlight the effect that changes to this traditional resource management have had on mountain habitats.

AB  - Before a forest operation Swedish forest owners need to fill in a registration form. Since 1994, when a new Swedish Forestry Act came into force, intended nature conservation measures can also be noted on the form. I evaluate 1) if the self-reported nature conservation intentions displayed any trends from 1995 to 2000, and 2) if the intentions were implemented. All forms from these years, in one municipality, were analysed and the stand structure retention was measured on 40 clear-cuts. The intentions, noted as check-marks on the form, showed an increasing trend during these years. However, the increase may be an artefact of changes the form during the time period. The number of check-marks on the forms and the stand structure items actually present on the 40 clear-cuts showed a positive relation. The clear-cuts with less than or equal to 3 check-marks on the form had lower amounts of the three most common items, than those with greater than or equal to4 check-marks. To conclude 1) a true increase in the self-reported intentions of the forest owners could not be established; 2) the intentions were generally followed by associated practices on the clear-cuts; 3) the amounts of stand structures retained were probably not enough to reach the biodiversity goal of the Forestry Act. The registration form could be improved to become less open for interpretation and contain quantified recommendations. Self-reported intentions of the forest owners could then possibly be used as indicators of real structural retention, which could facilitate planning and allow for making predictions about the future forests.

AB  - The European eel (Anguilla L.) is considered critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, and recruitment remains low. One of the challenges for the species today is migration barriers that limit their habitat. Along the Norwegian coast, like in other countries, the abundance of eels appears to decrease with distance from the sea. This pattern may be a result of factors like water temperature, water quality, competition, and habitat suitability and availability. This study aims to use environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to investigate the potential relationship between migration barriers and the decreasing occurrence of eels in distance from the sea by the coast of southern Norway. Sixty locations with potential migration barriers are investigated by collecting water samples upstream and downstream from each construction before eDNA from each sample is isolated and analyzed by realtime PCR with specific primers and probes matching A. anguilla. The results reveal that the probability of detecting eel eDNA decreases significantly with number of hydroelectric power stations and their associated basins, even when the effect of distance to sea is accounted for. In addition, there is a clear border at which eel eDNA could no longer be detected upstream of the major watercourses. Therefore, it is likely that the migration of eels is prohibited by these constructions, which seem to constitute a much greater challenge than every other type of potential migration barrier investigated in this study.

AB  - Conservation planning is challenging in landscapes where reoccurring habitat destruction and subsequent recovery affect metapopulation persistence, because different species respond differently to landscape change. By building on a graph-theoretical modeling framework, we here develop a connectivity model of how varying levels of area protection and unprotected areas predetermined for destruction affect species differently depending on (1) their tradeoff in colonization versus habitat utilization ability and (2) their maximum dispersal ability. We apply our model to 20,000 patches of old pine forest in northern Sweden, which host many threatened species but are scattered in a landscape dominated by intensive forestry. Unprotected mature forests stands predestined for logging are treated as adequate but temporarily available habitat for colonization specialists, whereas the same stands are assumed to, at best, serve only as intermediate stepping-stones for habitat specialists as they disperse between long-standing forests in protected areas. Our results show that the effect of habitat fragmentation on metapopulation persistence differs greatly not only depending on the dispersal distance of a particular species, but also on how well it utilizes habitat patches of different longevity. Such traits are discussed with respect to the spatiotemporal planning of habitat protection. Also, we suggest that the negative impacts of logging on biodiversity may be reduced if forestry practice is adjusted to better account for the ecological values of maturing production stands, through spatially explicit modeling of connectivity and of complementarity in the protection gradient.

T2  - ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA
LA  - English
AB  - The ecology and occurrence of Acanthocinus griseus in Finland is described to explain why this rarity was excluded from the latest national Red List. Careful examination of several trees inhabited by the species showed that the habitat requirements of A. griseus are in fact rather broad, contrary to previous assumptions. Acanthocinus griseus can breed in almost any part of the trunk of freshly dead, standing spruce and pine trees. All finds were made in normal managed forests or in burned areas. High mortality was observed during the larval stage due to parasitoids and predators. Adults of A. griseus live a cryptic life and larvae are difficult to find without experience, which may explain the low number of observations in Finland. Acanthocinus griseus is clearly an overlooked species and detailed examination of suitable trees would without doubt reveal many new occurrences in this country.

AB  - A multi-scaled model for biodiversity conservation in forests was introduced in Sweden 30 years ago, which makes it a pioneer example of an integrated ecosystem approach. Trees are set aside for biodiversity purposes at multiple scale levels varying from individual trees to areas of thousands of hectares, with landowner responsibility at the lowest level and with increasing state involvement at higher levels. Ecological theory supports the multi-scaled approach, and retention efforts at every harvest occasion stimulate landowners' interest in conservation. We argue that the model has large advantages but that in a future with intensified forestry and global warming, development based on more progressive thinking is necessary to maintain and increase biodiversity. Suggestions for the future include joint planning for several forest owners, consideration of cost-effectiveness, accepting opportunistic work models, adjusting retention levels to stand and landscape composition, introduction of temporary reserves, creation of "receiver habitats" for species escaping climate change, and protection of young forests.

AB  - The generic ecological impact assessment of alien species (GEIAA) is described. It comprises a set of criteria and an assessment procedure. The set of criteria consists of three criteria that quantify invasion potential, and six criteria that capture the ecological effects of alien species. The threshold values for all criteria are numerically defined, rendering the set of criteria fully quantitative. Genericity is ensured by using criteria that are applicable to all taxonomic groups and in all habitats. In being generic, quantitative, ecological and normatively neutral, the criteria were inspired by the international Red List criteria. Capturing both invasion potential and effect, GEIAA can be regarded as a full ecological impact assessment. The assessment procedure contains guidelines on documentation, the collection of background information, the handling of uncertainty, and quality assurance. GEIAA represents the second revision, and thus the third generation, of assessment methodology in Norway. It has recently been used to carry out more than 2500 impact assessments of alien species in Norway and Sweden.

AB  - The management of biological diversity at the landscape level in Finland is complicated by the relatively small size of the holdings and the fact that the habitats of species do not necessarily follow the holding borders. Therefore, there is a great need to develop such forest-planning approaches that aim at solving the problems that some species have faced due to modern forestry, including the fragmentation of old forests. One way to deal with fragmentation is to aggregate old forests into larger patches, a goal that may be achieved by excluding some areas from forestry operations or by restricting the intensity of treatments. In a planning area under multiple ownership, the sizes, shapes and relative locations of set-aside areas are important, since they affect the social equity of the proposed forest plans. In this study, the effects of two conflicting goals, i.e. the improvement of old-forest patterns, and the equal participation of forest owners were studied in a privately owned forest area in Finland. This was made possible through the examination of the consequences of alternative strategies to delineate areas set aside. The two main results of the study were, first, that it is difficult to reach these goals simultaneously, and, second, the time interval relevant in the management planning of private forestry is quite short with respect to efforts to change landscape structure significantly. However, in real planning situations, it is important to specify the locations of forest holdings whose owners are willing to acknowledge biodiversity values above the level defined in the legislation. In addition, ecologically important areas should be located and connected to the above information. According to the results of this study, it seems that a compensation system would facilitate the restructuring of the forest landscapes towards an ecologically enhanced structure.

AB  - In Finland, Norway and Sweden forest management is presently changing towards a more nature-orientated management. In this study the European Forest Information SCENario (EFISCEN) model was applied to determine how this change might affect the potential for wood production in the three countries. Three different management regimes, traditional, traditional with nature conservation ("conservation"), and longer rotations with nature conservation ("conservation +"), were combined with two alternative felling levels. The results show that conserving 6.1-8.8% of the older forests in the southern regions had no limiting effects on production levels, as foreseen by the European Timber Trend Studies V by the UN-ECE for Finland and Sweden. Under the conservation + scenario, maximum sustainable felling levels decreased to 84, 79 and 72% of the present levels in Finland, Norway and Sweden, respectively. Increasing the rotation length put more pressure on the older age classes and thus did not increase the average age of the forest. If the consumption of wood increases as quickly as indicated by other studies, it will be hard to fulfil that demand and at the same time conserve considerable areas of forest in the southern regions of the countries.

AB  - The article examines the interlinkages between recent developments in conflict management and impact assessment procedures in the context of urban planning in Finland. It sets out by introducing the fields of impact assessment and conflict mediation. It then proceeds to discuss the development of impact assessment practices and the status of conflict mediation in Finnish land use planning. The case of Korteniitty infill development plan in Jyvaskyla is used to demonstrate how the Finnish planning system operates in conflict situations and how social impact assessment can contribute to managing planning conflicts. The authors ask how the processes of impact assessment contribute to conflict management. Based on the Finnish experience, it is argued that social impact assessment of land use plans can contribute to conflict management, especially in the absence of institutionalised conflict mediation processes. In addition, SIA may acquire features of conflict mediation, depending on extent and intensity of stakeholder participation in the process, and the quality of linkages it between knowledge production and decision-making. Simultaneously, conflict mediation practices and theoretical insights can inform the application of SIA to help it address land use conflicts more consciously. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, we document the habitat (substrate) requirements of the red-listed fungus Phellinus nigrolimitatus and assess the effect of forest management (forest age, amount of dead wood), climatic zone, topography, forest type, and site productivity on the occurrence of this fungus. We investigated 159 sample sites with different histories of logging activity, in four climatic zones in SE Norway and recorded the fungus on 93 out of 4146 inspected logs in 33 of the 159 sites. The fungus was clearly most frequent on Picea abies (5.8%) but we also found it on five Pinus sylvestris logs (0.4%). The frequency of the species depended highly upon the decay class and diameter of the logs. We never found P. nigrolimitatus on recently dead logs and only once on a weakly decayed log. The frequency increased sharply on moderately decayed logs and even further on very decayed logs. We rarely found the species on small spruce logs, but found it on nearly a quarter of spruce logs in the diameter class >40 cm. P. nigrolimitatus exhibited a clear trend in being more frequent on spruce logs in highly productive sites compared to logs in sites of medium and low productivity. Furthermore, R nigrolimitatus showed a clear trend in being systematically more frequent from young to old-growth forest. When we related the frequency directly to the forest management history, as defined by the coarse woody debris profile, it turned out that the fungus was found on 35% of the suitable logs in the stands that had been unmanaged for several tree generations, while it was found on 4-9% of the suitable logs in managed forests. We found an average frequency reduction of 82% from natural forests to managed forests when we compared similar substrates. This frequency reduction in combination with reduced substrate availability suggests a population decline larger than 95% from the period before widespread logging, several centuries ago, until today.

AB  - Northern European peatlands are important habitats for biological conservation because they support rich biodiversity and unique species compositions. However, historical management of peatland habitats has had negative consequences for biodiversity and their degradation remains a major conservation concern. Despite increasing awareness of the conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peat land species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40% in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981-2014 (speed of decline 1.5%/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50% (2.0% annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20% during 1997-2014 (1.0% annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, where the majority of open peatlands are protected, showed a 40% increase during 1981-2014 (1.0% annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of rustic bunting, which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity.

AB  - Species-rich semi-natural grasslands have rapidly declined and become fragmented in Northern Europe due to ceased traditional agricultural practices and animal husbandry. Restoration actions have been introduced in many places to improve the habitat conditions and increase the area to prevent any further losses of their ecological values. However, given the limited resources and long time span needed for successful restoration, it is essential to target activities on sites having a suitable initial state and where the effects of restoration are most beneficial for the habitat network. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for evaluating the restoration potential of partially overgrown and selectively managed semi-natural grasslands in a moderately transformed agricultural environment in south-western Finland. On the basis of the spatio-temporal landscape trajectory analysis, we construct potential restoration scenarios based on expected semi-natural grassland characteristics that are derived from land productivity, detected grassland continuum, and date of overgrowth. These scenarios are evaluated using landscape metrics, their feasibility is discussed and the effects of potential restoration are compared to the present extent of open semi-natural grasslands. Our results show that landscape trajectory analysis and scenario construction can be valuable tools for the restoration planning of semi-natural grasslands with limited resources. The approach should therefore be considered as an essential tool to find the most optimal restoration sites and to pre-evaluate the effects.

AB  - When conserving or protecting rare or endangered species, current general guidelines for reducing light pollution might not suffice to ensure long-term threatened species' survival. Many protected areas are exposed to artificial light at levels with the potential to induce ecological impacts with unknown implications for the ecosystems they are designated to protect. Consequently, it is recommended that precautionary methods for the avoidance and mitigation of light pollution in protected areas be integrated into their management plans. This paper's aims are to present an overview of best practices in precautionary methods to avoid and mitigate light pollution in protected areas and to identify and discuss what ecosystems should be considered light-sensitive and how to prioritise species and habitats that need protection from artificial light, including examples of legislation covering ecological light pollution in the European Union and in Sweden. The important aspects to include when considering light pollution at a landscape level are listed, and a proposal for prioritisation among species and habitats is suggested. Sensitive and conservation areas and important habitats for particularly vulnerable species could be prioritised for measures to minimise artificial lighting's negative effects on biodiversity. This may be done by classifying protected natural environments into different zones and applying more constrained principles to limit lighting. The light pollution sensitivity of various environments and ecosystems suggests that different mitigation strategies and adaptations should be used depending on landscape characteristics, species sensitivity and other factors that may determine whether artificial light may be detrimental. Issues of the currently used measurement methods for artificial light at night are reviewed. We also propose and discuss the principles and benefits of using standardized measurement methods and appropriate instrumentation for field measurements of artificial light concerning the environmental impact of light pollution.

AB  - Habitat destruction is today the most severe threat to global biodiversity. Despite decades of efforts, there is still no proper methodology on how to assess all aspects of impacts on biodiversity from land use and land use changes (LULUC) in life cycle analysis (LCA). A majority of LCA studies on land extensive activities still do not include LULUC. In this study, we test different approaches for assessing the impact of land use and land use change related to hydropower for use in LCA and introduce restoration cost as a new approach.
   We assessed four hydropower plant projects in planning phase (two upgrading plants with reservoir and two new run-of-river plants) in Southern Norway with comparable geography, biodiversity, and annual energy production capacity. LULUC was calculated for each habitat type, based on mapping of present and future land use, and was further allocated to energy production for each power plant. Three different approaches to assess land use impact were included: ecosystem scarcity/vulnerability, biogenic greenhouse gas (bGHG) emissions, and the cost of restoring affected habitats. Restoration cost represents a novel approach to LCA for measuring impact of LULUC.
   Overall, the three approaches give similar rankings of impacts: larger impact for small and new power plants and less for larger and expanding existing plants. Reservoirs caused a larger total area affected. Permanent infrastructure has a more similar absolute impact for run-of-river and reservoir-based hydropower, and consequently give relatively larger impact for smaller run-of-river hydropower. All approaches reveal impacts on wetland ecosystems as most important relative to other ecosystems. The methods used for all three approaches would benefit from higher resolution data on land use, habitats, and soil types. Total restoration cost is not accurate, due to uncertainty of offset ratios, but relative restoration costs may still be used to rank restoration alternatives and compare them to the costs of biodiversity offsets.
   The different approaches assess different aspects of land use impacts, but they all show large variation of impact between the studied hydropower plants, which shows the importance of including LULUC in LCA for hydropower projects. Improved data of total restoration cost (and cost accounting) are needed to implement this approach in future LCA.

AB  - Conservation of representative biotopes, single species populations or biodiversity usually embraces two or more biotopes, and is often affected by surrounding croplands. The conclusions from landscape ecological studies can, therefore, offer important contributions to conservation, especially at early levels of landscape change or habitat fragmentation. Indicator and keystone species are useful for monitoring and managing fragmented biotopes, respectively. Communities as well as single species are affected by the juxtaposition of successional and climax biotopes, which influence climatic equability, seasonality, productivity and dispersal. Low levels of fragmentation may result in ill-functioning communities, and greater fragmentation may result in species losses and ultimately in the loss of whole communities. Fragmented habitats retain species with high reproductive and dispersal rates and generalized habitat selection. New combinations of interacting species will lead to trivialization of earlier habitat-specific interactions. Validation of these concepts was made with data from a Swedish research program on fragmented biotopes in production landscapes. General reserve selection and methods of management for preserving climax communities, single specialized species and high biodiversity are suggested.

AB  - In the last 50-60 years, agricultural intensification and later urban development have threatened the rare and valuable gully landscape formed on marine clay. We studied landscape changes in eastern Akershus county in south-east Norway, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of marine gullies. Interpretation of aerial photos showed that about 25% of the gully area has been lost. Only 39.5% of the remaining area is original gullies, and 60.5% of the area has been affected by landscape change. The largest loss of gully area was between 1955 and 1991, mainly through land levelling and transformation to intensively managed agricultural landscape. The most densely populated areas also lost gullies to residential areas and industry. Gullies support high plant and animal diversity, and future management should be based on landscape ecological principles. Gully fragments should also be preserved to maintain connectivity between the many different habitats belonging to the gullies.

AB  - Utilisation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) for the valorisation of unproductive land in the Walloon region (southern Belgium) during the second half of the XIXth century has caused dramatic loss of biodiversity. However, it preserved some areas from the general eutrophication due to agriculture intensification. We investigated the reconstituting vegetation on clearcuts of 25 to 50 year old plantations. Vegetation composition is widely in accordance with past extensive land use before Norway spruce plantation and characteristic species are generally well represented. Best-conserved habitats are Calluna heathlands and acidic mires. We also examined the persistent soil seed bank in three standing plantations. Species present in these seed banks are nearly the same as those found in situ in clearcuts. So the potential of these new environments is high in terms of nature restoration and conservation.

AB  - Many bumblebee species are declining due to a loss of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes resulting in diminished forage and nest sites. Anecdotal experience indicates that bumblebees nest in straw bales, but scientific evidence is lacking. We spent 250 h screening for bumblebee nests in 1255 straw bales and ten straw stacks belonging to 58 farms in two intensively farmed Swedish regions and recorded nests, nest traffic, and straw characteristics. We supplemented the straw screening with screening of control areas, without straw, that were selected in similar environments as the areas with straw. We observed 45 bumblebee nests (including potential nests where a single bumblebee flew in or out of the straw) of eight species/ species groups, including one red-listed, in or directly adjacent to the straw at 26 of the farms. Nests were mainly found in partly decayed straw and bales placed together. We found no nests in control areas. Based on our results, we suggest that straw can be used as an easy, cheap and efficient intervention to increase the availability of bumblebee nest sites in agricultural landscapes. Considering the costs and benefits of the alternatives, we conclude that straw addition has advantages over commercial bumblebee colonies for crop pollination purposes and over artificial nest boxes for conservation purposes.

AB  - A strong link has been observed between urbanization processes and conversions of farmland to built-up land. Most previous research has addressed such conversion of farmland in relation to the expansion of larger cities. However, broader analysis of both rural and central areas is needed to increase the empirical basis for these claims. Based on GIS analysis of farmland conversions, this paper aims to expand our understanding of how urban sprawl affects conversion of farmland. We find that most farmland in Norway is converted to built-up areas in relation to existing urban settlement areas. In line with population growth, urban areas in the most central municipalities experience the most significant urban sprawl and loss of farmland. Moreover, the remaining farmland is located in the same areas that already have converted the most. These areas also experience significant pressure for continued land take. Assuming current trends continue, future urban sprawl will pose great challenges for the preservation of farmland in land-use planning. New research and policies are required to handle these challenges more effectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reindeer management (RM) in northern Fennoscandia is an example of social-ecological systems (SESs) providing social, cultural, ecological, and economic values. Changing climate and pasture conditions and societal changes continue to transform the operational environment of RM. These key drivers, and resulting transformations including alternative SES states, have not been studied in detail before. Our comprehensive literature review and interviews with herders reveal that land use, climate change, and governance drive the emergence of SES tipping points. The basis of successful RM depends on the quantity and quality of pastures to secure animal fitness. However, intensive forestry, extreme weather, and predators constrain the availability of forage and suitable calving grounds. Maintaining RM by means of predation compensation mechanisms and regular supplementary winter feeding to adapt to changes brought about by land use and warming climate comprises an alternative system state. However, if negative impacts increase remarkably or rapidly and compensatory mechanisms become insufficient, long-term impacts on system identity, and even local collapses, are expected. Although some environmental and societal changes are perceived as pressures by herders, they can be beneficial for other livelihoods in the region. Therefore, our study raises questions for future studies on social justice, such as who has the right to decide what constitutes a desirable system state, or what collaborative efforts to maintain RM in Fennoscandia would entail. Our work is applicable also in other Arctic/sub-Arctic regions where nature-based livelihoods, such as small-scale forestry and agriculture, hunting, traditional fishing, and gathering are practiced.

AB  - Secondary succession in protected oak-rich temperate forests reduces variation in habitats and leads to denser, shadier sites. Long-term experimental studies of the effects of conservation management alternatives are needed for such forests. Here we present a rare follow-up study of the response of beetles (a highly diverse taxon with many red listed species) to conservation thinning, an action that could favour biodiversity. We previously harvested about 25% of the tree and shrub basal area in a treatment plot, and no trees and shrubs in a nearby matched minimal intervention plot, in each of eight oak-rich (Quercus robur and/or petrea) forest reserves. After two seasons, thinning had led to an increased number of species of both herbivorous and saproxylic beetles. In the present study, we examined the 10-year response of the beetle groups at the same sites. For herbivorous beetles, the initial positive effect of thinning on the number of species had disappeared after 10 years, presumably because of regrowth. In contrast, saproxylic beetles showed a further positive response after 10 years, increasing in the number of species by a third compared to before thinning. We found no change in species composition of either group due to the thinning, but many saproxylics were unique to thinning plots. Overall, our results suggest that in mixed oak-rich forests, saproxylic beetles seem to benefit from conservation-oriented thinning for at least 10 years.

AB  - In the mainland Nordic countries and the Baltic States, the delineation and set-aside of woodland key habitats (WKHs) has been one important approach to conserving biodiversity outside traditional protected areas. Though the specifics of the key habitat concept differ from country to country, the intent is to set aside forest areas that (1) exhibit a low degree of exploitation, (2) host or potentially host red-listed species, and/or (3) contain old-growth characteristics (e.g. dead wood, large old trees) or other qualities considered valuable for maintaining biodiversity. However, it is still uncertain to what extent WKHs actually retain quantities and qualities of coarse woody debris (CWD) that are characteristic of old-growth forests. The Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (BMP) recently conducted a detailed inventory of 491 WKHs across Sweden, providing a large dataset with which to evaluate the effectiveness of the WKH program with respect to CWD. In the present study we analyze the BMP data and compare CWD volume and composition between WKHs, mature managed (stand age 81-120 years), overmature managed (age 121-140 years), and published findings from old-growth forests. The national average volume of CWD (standing and downed combined, m(3)/ha) was higher in WKHs (19.5) than the mature managed (9.3) and the overmature managed forest (12.2), yet was markedly lower than that reported from old-growth forests. CWD volumes in spruce-dominated WKHs had been reduced by 50-63% in the southern and middle boreal regions to 43-64% in the northern boreal region when compared to old-growth forests. In general, CWD amount, variability and quality were greater within WKHs in the boreal regions as opposed to the nemoral and boreonemoral regions in the south of Sweden. The majority of the WKHs (64%) contained key elements (very large and/or decayed dead wood known to be crucial habitat for many threatened wood-dependent species). Considering that these structures are largely absent from managed forests, WKHs have better retained some of the important features of old-growth forests when compared to the surrounding managed forest. WKHs are therefore valuable habitats for dead wood dependent species and representative focal areas for continued and future forest restoration and landscape planning. Our results confirm that large sun-exposed and burned dead wood are underrepresented CWD components within WKHs and emphasize the need to broaden the WKH definition to include locations containing these structures.

AB  - Intensive forest management has been applied in most Fennoscandian forests for a period of almost one felling rotation. This paradigm has produced even-aged and even-structured forests of different successional stages that cover about 90% of forest land. At the same time, wildfires have been nearly eliminated in most of the Fennoscandian nature. Consequently, hundreds of species are red-listed because of forest management. To support these species, forest management requires improvements. Variable retention forestry and habitat restoration have been suggested to mitigate negative effects of forest management on biodiversity, and these have been practiced to some extent during the past few decades. Here, we review experimental results on the effects of variable retention and two restoration measures (prescribed burning and artificial addition of coarse woody debris) on different species groups in Fennoscandia. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Many species respond positively to felling within a few years, apparently due to released and often ephemeral resources, such as fresh residue and stumps. Species associated with shady conditions are negatively impacted, but any retention supports many of these, and their species composition remains almost unaffected with 50-70% retention of the initial tree volume. (ii) These effects remain detectable for at least 10- 30 years or, according to some studies, nearly 100 years, e.g., in polypore fungi. (iii) Initial effects of prescribed burning on most species groups (apart from pyrophiles) are negative, but within 10-15 years post-fire sites begin to support many rare and threatened deadwood-dependent species. Epiphytic lichens, however, remain negatively affected. (iv) Artificial addition of deadwood (mostly high stumps) supports a wide spectrum of deadwood-dependent species, but the species composition differs from that of naturally died trees. (v) Moisture and micro-habitat variation are crucial for forest species at harvested sites, at least in forests dominated by Norway spruce. We conclude that felling method as such is of little importance for threatened forest species, although retention mitigates many negative effects. These species require microclimatic continuity, and maintenance and active increase of legacies, such as deadwood of different qualities (species, downed/standing, snag/log/stump, decay stage), very old trees, and tree species mixtures.

AB  - Public support for biodiversity conservation is shaped by people's values and their knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward the environment. We conducted the first multinational representative survey of the general public's perceptions of river fish biodiversity in France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. For the online survey, 1000 respondents per country were randomly selected from large panels following country-specific quotas set on age, gender, and educational level. Questions covered people's level of knowledge, beliefs, values, and attitudes toward river fish, environmental threats, and conservation measures. We found that the public had limited knowledge of freshwater fishes. Two non-native species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), were widely perceived as native, whereas native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was mostly classified as native in Scandinavia and largely as non-native in central Europe. These results suggest an extinction of experience paralleling the extirpation or decline of salmon stocks in countries such as Germany and France. Respondents thought pollution was the dominant threat to riverine fish biodiversity. In reality, habitat loss, dams, and the spread of non-native fishes are equally important. Despite limited biological knowledge, respondents from all countries held an overwhelmingly proecological worldview, supported conservation stocking, and appreciated native fishes, although only a minority interacted with them directly. Differences among the 4 countries related to several conservation issues. For example, threats to biodiversity stemming from aquaculture were perceived as more prevalent in Norway compared with the other 3 countries. Promoting fish conservation based on charismatic species and use values of fishes may work well in countries with a strong economic and cultural link to the freshwater environment, such as Norway. In countries where people rather abstractly care for nature, focusing conservation messaging on broader ecosystem traits and non-use values of fishes is likely to win more support.

AB  - Green spaces have important amenity values contributing to the quality of urban life. The deconstruction of green spaces cause negative extemalities e.g. the loss of non-priced benefits. In land-use planning, therefore, amenity values should be systematically assessed and measured commensurately, i.e. in monetary terms with material values. This paper discusses the suitability of the contingent valuation method in assessing urban forest benefits, and presents the main results of an empirical study conducted in Joensuu, the capital of North Carelia, Finland. The study was designed to measure the use-values of urban wooded recreation areas, and the residents' willingness to pay for small forest parks contributing to the quality of the housing environment. The results suggest that most visitors were willing to pay for the use of wooded recreation areas. Furthermore, approximately half of the respondents were willing to pay to prevent the conversion of forested parks to another land-use. The results can be used to assess the profitability of the management of urban forests. In addition, the results are useful in assessing the value of green space benefits in different land use options. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge in the magnitude and historical trends in land use and land cover (LULC) is needed to understand the changing status of the key elements of the landscape and to better target management efforts. However, this information is not easily available before the start of satellite campaign missions. Scanned historical maps are a valuable but underused source of LULC information. As a case study, we used U-Net to automatically extract fields, mires, roads, watercourses, and water bodies from scanned historical maps, dated 1965, 1984 and 1985 for our 900 km(2 )study area in Southern Finland. We then used these data, along with the topographic databases from 2005 and 2022, to quantify the LULC changes for the past 57 years. For example, the total area of fields decreased by around 27 km(2), and the total length of watercourses increased by around 2250 km in our study area.

AB  - The population of Lobaria pulmonaria (tree lungwort) has been regarded as a relict on the Aland Islands (Ahvenanmaa). Fresh findings of apothecia imply the opposite. Censusing of 13 localities with more than 200 trees has shown that the lichen predominantly grows along the NW-NE sector of tree trunks with porous bark in easterly slopes. In light and dry wooded meadows the lichen has a lower vitality than in undisturbed, shady and moist forests. Most thalli occurred on Acer platanoides, Fraxinus excelsior and Populus tremula, even though Quercus robur, Tilia cordata and some other species were also represented. About half of the trees were found in Hockbole and it was also there and at Ingersholma that we found apothecia.

AB  - Introduction Urban areas are challenging environments for wetland species with complex habitat requirements and life cycles. However, even semiaquatic species, representing such complex wetland groups, can be provided with adequate conditions through thorough understanding of their habitat requirements coupled with comprehensive wetland management.Methods We studied the occurrence and abundance of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), a widely distributed amphibian, in an urban landscape in metropolitan Helsinki, Finland. We classified 50 randomly selected urban wetlands based on their connectivity by applying isolation scores counted using principal component analysis (PCA) and measured the occurrence and abundance of smooth newts in these locations.Results Our analyses showed well-connected wetland sites to differ significantly in smooth newt occurrence from both isolated and partially connected sites. Additionally, smooth newt abundance in well-connected wetlands differed from isolated sites. A PCA model with residential buildings (negative effect) and aquatic vegetation (positive effect) best explained smooth newt occurrence and total and male abundance, and female newt occurrence was best explained by a model also incorporating forest and natural open areas. Predation pressure by fish negatively influenced both smooth newt occurrence and abundance.Discussion Tighter networks of constructed wetlands and stricter management guidelines for urban wetland planning and fish community management could increase the suitable habitat for smooth newts in urban landscapes. Managing such areas for the common smooth newt offers potential broad benefits to the conservation of other semiaquatic amphibians and reptiles in urban wetlands and to urban wetland biodiversity in general. Our results show that smooth newt presence may indicate sustained wetland connectivity in an urban landscape and could even be used to signal successful urban planning.

AB  - Increasing urbanisation calls for careful landscape conservation planning to maintain biodiversity in urban areas. Urbanisation not only decreases the amount and quality of habitats, but it also affects habitat connectivity, which is crucial for species' long-term persistence. The mitigation hierarchy approach of avoiding, reducing and off-setting the negative impacts of development projects is a powerful tool to prevent biodiversity loss. However, this process is typically used at the local scale and on a project-by-project basis, ignoring the cumulated effects of several projects on habitat connectivity. We applied a landscape-level approach to the mitigation hierarchy to achieve no net loss of connectivity during urban planning. Using spatial graphs, we assessed avoidance, reduction and offsetting scenarios for mitigating the impact of ten urban development projects in the city of Jyva & BULL;skyla & BULL;, Finland, here focusing on the habitat network of the endangered Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). We found a negative impact of urban development on network connectivity and prioritised habitat patches and corridors, which should be maintained to avoid and reduce the impacts. The no net loss of connectivity was achieved by adding new habitat patches in locations that maximise connectivity. We also found that the results were highly sensitive to variations in the dispersal distance of the focal species used in the connectivity model. An inadequate reference value for this parameter may lead to underestimation of the impacts of development projects and, therefore, insufficient mitigation actions. With a case study, we showed that spatial graph analysis can support decision-making by identifying and prioritising the actions needed to maintain habitat connectivity in urban landscapes.

AB  - Creation of urban images is part of the global economy, and modern townscapes are results of interplay between politics, culture and markets. Global ideals within architecture and planning have left imprints on local town development in Norway. Cultural heritage is affected by these processes, and the role cultural heritage plays in creating urban images is analysed in a qualitative case-study of four medium sized Norwegian towns. Through interviews with central actors in the planning process and analyses of planning documents on municipal and county level, the main questions raised are how municipal planners relate to questions concerning integration of historic fabric in new urban development. Has increased focus on culture in urban planning led to new planning strategies and more cooperation between municipal planners and cultural heritage managers? Despite the fact that the towns in focus have an urban core stamped as valuable historic centre, the results show that this is not sufficient to give the cultural heritage managers empowerment outside their limited domain. Actual planning practice reveals that the cultural heritage is handled more as a useful means in the rhetoric of local politics than as an important resource for a sustainable future. Fragmented planning renders consideration to the reciprocity which exists between the historic fabric, the townscape and the natural environment difficult. The results are discussed in view of the central role aesthetics and visuality has been ascribed in contemporary cities, and how the introduction of New Liberalism planning principles has affected cultural heritage management at municipal level.

AB  - Based on Norwegian and Swedish representative national samples, and samples from areas with large mammalian carnivores present, we investigated whether well-known predictors for approval of wolves may explain between-country differences. Swedes were in general more positive than Norwegians were, while respondents in large carnivore areas, regardless of nationality, were less positive. The profile of those who approved wolf presence was the same in all samples. The difference between the samples was greater in Sweden, indicating that the relationship between urbanized and rural areas is more polarized in Sweden compared to Norway. We suggest this to be an effect of the fact that Norway's large carnivore and agriculture policies favor the rural population, and of a higher degree of urbanization in Sweden. We recommend future studies to look into the different power relations between people living in urban and rural areas, comparing countries with different degree of urbanization.

AB  - To prevent local species extinction and to counteract population declines, we must ensure species have access to resources they require for life. This can be done through ecological restoration where previously depleted resources are reintroduced. If the restoration is conducted as a one-off action in a large area, it resembles a natural resource pulse, which should lead to increased abundance of individuals, accompanied possibly by increased species richness. Species-energy relationship and underlying theory enable predictions about how different features of resource pulses affect species richness. We conducted a large-scale, controlled, randomized and replicated field experiment to study the effect of a resource addition on polypore species richness in a previously managed boreal forest landscape in Finland. We manipulated the amount and distribution of dead wood and studied the effects on polypore assemblages on added and natural dead wood during 9years after manipulation (2004-2012). By adding dead wood, species richness grew, mainly through increasing abundances: a large amount of dead wood resulted in higher abundance, higher number and faster accumulation of species than a small amount of dead wood. For a given abundance, dead wood addition contained fewer species than natural dead wood. This is most probably because added dead wood was of low diversity and provided habitat only for a limited number of species. Species richness on natural dead wood increased substantially during the study period, and this increase was not related to the resource manipulation. Thus, habitat improvement through natural succession can occur within a relatively short time period irrespective of human intervention. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how the introduction of dead wood additions can strengthen polypore populations. The species taking advance of the introduced resource were primarily common species, instead of rare or red-listed species. Thus, we recommend ensuring the natural formation of dead wood while the populations of the common species supporting ecosystem functions can be increased by adding dead wood in the landscape.

AB  - Industrial forestry has caused large biodiversity changes in European boreal forests. One recently introduced conservation measure in production forestry is retention of trees at clearcutting to benefit flora and fauna. Aspen Populus tremula is often retained for conservation purposes since it is a key tree species for biodiversity with many associated species, a number of which are red-listed. Still, the importance to biodiversity of aspen trees retained at harvest is largely unknown. In 1994, a transplantation experiment with the old-growth forest indicator lichen Lobaria pulmonaria was set up on 280 aspens at 35 sites in east-central Sweden with a total of 1120 transplants, with the aim to assess the habitat suitability of retained aspens following harvest. After 14 years 23% of L. pulmonaria transplants remained, with a significantly higher survival on retained aspens than on aspens in the surrounding forest, especially on the northern side of stems. Transplants were also more vital on northern than on southern sides of stems. There was no difference in survival or vitality of transplants between dispersed aspens and aspens in groups. Results largely agreed with a re-inventory made already after two years but the importance of the north side of retention trees became evident for species survival only after 14 years, indicating that to gain deeper insights longer time-spans may be necessary. This study, which is the longest lichen transplantation time-series from a well replicated experiment so far published, shows that retention of trees at harvest may be an efficient conservation action.

AB  - In recent decades, the growing need for biodiversity conservation and the different means of achieving it have been defined in international and national procedures regulated by governments and parliaments on the one hand, and in governance processes run by different stakeholders on the other. In local contexts, however, people perceive the abstract phenomenon of biodiversity conservation through the environment in which they live and through their social and cultural positions. We examine Finnish forest owners' experiences and perceptions of biodiversity conservation, and consider the compatibility of these perceptions with national conservation policy. our work is based on a survey of forest owners and the content analysis of national policy documents. We found that the perceptions of forest owners and the documents of nature conservation policy had elements that both overlapped and contradicted each other, thus,reflecting different interpretations of forest ownership and biodiversity conservation. Moreover, the national Forest Biodiversity Program - an outcome of a multilateral governance process - was more successful in combining conservation policy with various perspectives of forest owners than was the authoritatively formulated Nature Conservation Act and Decree. This result indicates that governance processes can address conflicts of interest in the use of natural resources. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation resource allocation involves a complex set of considerations including species, habitats, connectivity, local to global biodiversity objectives, alternative protection and restoration actions, while requiring cost-efficiency and effective implementation. We present a national scale spatial conservation prioritization analysis for complementing the network of protected mires in Finland. We show how spatial prioritization coupled with regional targets and expert knowledge can facilitate structured decision-making. In our application, discussion between experts was structured around the prioritization model enabling integration of quantitative analysis with expert knowledge. The used approach balances requirements of many biodiversity features over large landscapes, while aiming at a cost-effective solution. As a special analytical feature, mire complexes were defined prior to prioritization to form hydrologically functional planning units, including also their drained parts that require restoration for the planning unit to remain or potentially increase in value. This enabled selection of mires where restoration effort is supporting and benefitting from the core mire areas of high conservation value. We found that a key to successful implementation was early on structured co-producing between analysts, mire experts, and decision-makers. This allowed effective multidirectional knowledge transfer and evaluation of trade-offs related to the focal conservation decisions. Quantitative trade-off information was seen especially helpful by the stakeholders to decide how to follow the analysis results. Overall, we illustrate a realistic and applicable spatial conservation prioritization case supporting real world conservation decision-making. The introduced approach can be applied globally to increase effectiveness of large-scale protection and management planning of the diverse wetland ecosystem complexes.

AB  - Land use changes. urbanisation and infrastructure developments in particular. cause fragmentation of natural habitats and threaten biodiversity. Tools and measures must be adapted to assess and remedy the potential effects on biodiversity caused by human activities and developments. Within physical planning, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) play important roles in the prediction and assessment of biodiversity-related impacts from planned developments. However, adapted prediction tools to forecast and quantify potential impacts on biodiversity components are lacking. This study tested and compared four different CIS-based habitat models and assessed their relevance for applications in environmental assessment. The models were implemented in the Stockholm region in central Sweden and applied to data on the crested tit (Parus cristatus), a sedentary bird species of coniferous forest. All four models performed well and allowed the distribution of suitable habitats for the crested tit in the Stockholm region to be predicted. The models were also used to predict and quantify habitat loss for two regional development scenarios. The study highlighted the importance of model selection in impact prediction. Criteria that are relevant for the choice of model for predicting impacts on biodiversity were identified and discussed. Finally, the importance of environmental assessment for the preservation of biodiversity within the general frame of biodiversity conservation is emphasised. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tourism is increasingly seen as a necessary income diversification strategy in rural Europe, especially in areas where traditional rural businesses are facing decreasing profitability. This view is clearly expressed in Norwegian government strategies. Measures to support tourism development are launched by public management bodies at national and regional level. For rural agrarian communities the cultural landscape is seen as an asset in developing tourism. The authors study the interplay between farming and tourism in Geiranger in western Norway using narrative and discourse analysis. Since the late 19th century, tourism and farming have co-existed in Geiranger. Recently, the area has also been subject to nature conservation and obtained World Heritage Status. Inspired by political ecology literature, the authors aim to identify and compare the narratives of local actors, and link these narratives to broader environmental discourses.

AB  - Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within I km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of "townscape" composition for species richness in urban habitats but also, demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

AB  - Tools to effectively apply biological information in daily physical planning cases are viewed as essential in order to preserve and manage natural habitats in highly pressured urban areas. This paper describes a GIS-based management tool for conservation and management of biodiversity and the process of implementation in the capital of Oslo, Norway. The main objective of this multi-agency effort is to ensure a sustainable and responsible management of the biodiversity within the municipality. A political decision on the state level encourages all municipalities to survey and classify their biological diversity according to a scale of importance within 2003. Furthermore the results from the survey were encouraged to be implemented in the daily physical planning at a local level. The assignment called for structured, classified and accessible information about the biological resources of the municipality. The electronic tool presented makes it possible to combine biological information with any other information that is relevant for a planning issue. We believe the GIS-based management tool has a strong potential to be transferred to other municipalities in Norway as well as to other countries with organised environmental management systems at both local, regional and national levels.

AB  - Modern intensive forestry worldwide is posing serious threats to old-growth forest specialist species. Cost-effective conservation can only be achieved when the ecology and distribution of species are well understood. The present distribution of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), a vulnerable species in Finland (and Europe), is poorly known, and its ecology studied only locally. We conducted a nationwide survey of the species to assess its distribution and derived habitat variables from the National Forest Inventory dataset to study its habitat requirements. We performed separate logistic regression models of the species occurrence at two separate spatial scales, small (9 ha plot) and landscape (1 km radius) extent. At the small scale, occurrence increased with average forest age and volume of spruce trees. At the landscape scale, occurrence was positively related to cover of mature spruce/mixed forests, density of suitable habitat patches and, rather unexpectedly, agricultural fields. Occurrence of flying squirrel was generally higher in restricted regions of central-western Finland, where the forested landscape is more fragmented by agricultural fields, compared to the rest of the country. Our findings indicate that the species can make use of fragmented habitat mosaics including forests and the interface between forests and fields. Conserving spruce dominated mature stands in these landscape mosaics is a key to maintaining adequate habitat for the species. We conclude that conservation efforts should also be directed to the most highly man-modified landscapes, where the preservation of habitat patches of good quality for the species should be integrated within the forest management plans.

AB  - P>1. The signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is an invasive species in Sweden, threatening the red-listed nobel crayfish Astacus astacus through spreading the crayfish plague. Time-to-event models can handle censored data on such introduced populations for which the state (successful or not) is only partially known at the last observation, but even though data on introduced populations most often are censored, this type of model is usually not used for likelihood-based inference and predictions of the dynamics of establishing populations.
   2. We specified and fitted a probabilistic time-to-event model to be used to predict the time to successful establishment of signal crayfish populations introduced into Sweden. Important covariates of establishment success were found by the methods of 'model averaging' and 'hierarchical partitioning', considering model uncertainty and multi-colinearity, respectively.
   3. The hazard function that received the highest evidence based on the empirical data showed that the chances of establishment were highest in the time periods immediately following the first introduction. The model predicts establishment success to be < 50% within 5 years after first introduction over the current distributional range of signal crayfish in Sweden today.
   4. Among covariates related to temperature, fish species and physical properties of the habitat, the length of the growing season was the most important and consistent covariate of establishment success. We found that establishment success of signal crayfish is expected to increase with the number of days when growth is possible, and decrease with the number of days with extremely high temperatures, which can be seen to approximate conditions of stress.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate lower establishment success of signal crayfish further north in Sweden, which may decrease the incentives of additional illegal introductions that may threaten the red-listed noble crayfish Astacus astacus. We provide a fully probabilistic statistical evaluation that quantifies uncertainty in the duration of the establishment stage that is useful for management decisions of invasive species. The combination of model averaging and hierarchical partitioning provides a comprehensive method to address multi-colinearity common to retrospective data on establishment success of invasive species.

AB  - Many protected areas have a long history of human intervention before being protected. In protected forests, the past land use has reduced the amount of natural structures, which are crucial substrates for thousands of species. We evaluate the short-term ecological effect of forest restoration (dead wood creation) on conifer-associated saproxylic (dead-wood dependent) beetles. More specifically, we analyze the effect of dead wood creation on the number of beetle species and individuals 1 and 5 years after restoration in spruce and pine forests, using a large-scale monitoring network over Finland. The number of saproxylic beetle species and individuals was larger at restored than at control plots both 1 and 5 years after restoration in both spruce and pine forests. Community composition in restored plots was different from control plots 1 year after restoration, but had returned towards the control plot composition 5 years after restoration, while control plots remained largely unchanged. Both in spruce and pine forests, there were more red-listed and rare saproxylic beetles in restored than in control plots 1 and 5 years after restoration. Our results indicate that restoration has an overall positive influence on saproxylic beetle diversity immediately after dead wood creation, but this effect is rather short-lived. Long term monitoring of restored dead wood is crucial in investigating successional pathways as well as biotic communities in advanced decay stages, and in fully evaluating the ecological effect of dead wood creation as a forest restoration measure.

AB  - Forestry has significantly changed many boreal forest landscapes with negative effects on biodiversity. Main reasons are habitat loss and deterioration, due to a simplified forest composition, including a reduction in old trees and dead wood. In Sweden, measures to counter the loss of biodiversity are taken at forest harvesting, and include forest harvest retention. Areas of high conservation values (AHCV) have been identified in Sweden to prioritise conservation efforts, but so far these areas have not been used when making decisions about forest harvest retention. In this study, we tested if dead wood from forest harvest retention is used by more dead wood-dependent insect species (24 beetles and four other insects, redlisted or indicating high biodiversity) on clearcuts within than outside of AHCVs and whether the composition of the surrounding landscape influences species occurrence. There were not more dead wood-dependent insect species per clearcut within AHCVs than outside. The surrounding landscape had an influence on the species richness on clearcuts, but in several cases the pattern was the opposite of our hypotheses. Increased standing volume of relevant tree species, however, tended to increase the occurrence or number of associated species. The designation of ACHVs in Sweden is not related with occurrence of dead wood or dead wood-dependent organisms. We also found that landscape context can have effects on species richness. The result urges for better planning so that ACHV areas are designated in landscapes where their potential for conservation of dead wood-dependent organisms is highest.

AB  - Remaining patches of semi-natural grasslands are hot spots for biodiversity in modern agricultural landscapes. In Sweden semi-natural pastures cover approximately 500,000 ha. However, power-line corridors, road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000 ha), and these open, less intensively managed habitats are potentially important for species associated with taller vegetation and flower resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative importance of semi-natural pastures and the other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland mosaic landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed significantly between habitats in multivariate analyses. Power-line corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species that were disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species, respectively), and power-line corridors also harbored several species that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more individuals of red-listed species in power-line corridors than in the other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species composition was significantly associated with landscape composition and species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant in forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields. Analyses of flying time and host plants for larvae suggest that early flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more common in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape perspective, which takes several habitats into account, is needed for conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes. Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating habitats that are suitable for pollinating insects through conservation-oriented management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Few studies have covered both the effects of climate and land-use change on animal populations under a single framework. Besides, the scarce multi-species studies conducted have focused on breeding data, and there is little information published on changes in wintering populations. Here, we relate the pattern of long-term temporal trends of wintering bird populations in Finland, north Europe, to covariates associated with climate and land-use change. Finnish wintering populations have been monitored using ca 10 km winter bird census routes (> 420 routes counted annually) during 1959-2012. Population trends of 63 species were related to migratory strategy, urbanity, and thermal niche measured as species-specific centre of gravity of the wintering distribution. Waterbird trends have shown a marked increase compared to landbirds. Among landbirds, forest species have suffered severe declines, whereas urban species have considerably increased in their wintering numbers. To follow up these results, we produced three multi-species indices (for waterbirds, forest and urban species, respectively), which can improve our ability to detect and monitor the specific consequences of climate change and changes in land-use, but at the same time act as a feedback to track the conservation status of the species. Our results suggest that waterbirds are responding to climate change, given their dependence on open water and the correlation with early-winter temperature over the last decades. On the other hand, we believe trends of landbirds have been mainly driven by human-induced land-use changes. While urban species have likely benefited from the increase of supplementary feeding, forest species have probably suffered from the loss of native habitats.

AB  - Current occurrence patterns of species associated with ancient trees may reflect higher historical habitat densities, because the dynamics of the habitat and the colonisation-extinction processes for many inhabiting species are expected to be slow. We tested this hypothesis in southeast Sweden by analysing species occurrence per parish for twelve redlisted lichen species and nine redlisted fungus species in relation with current density of big oaks, the density of oaks in the 1830s and connectivity with parishes with the species present. For most species, the occurrence was positively related with current density of habitat (for 18 species out of 21) and parish area (for 16 species). Historical habitat density was positively related with occurrence for 11 species, while connectivity with current occurrences in the surroundings was positive for the occurrence of 12 species and negative for the occurrence of two. For lichen species the connectivity measure that best explained the variation was at a larger spatial scale as compared to fungus species. Even if the density of old oaks remains in the future, inhabiting species will most likely decline because their distribution patterns are not in equilibrium with the current habitat density. Therefore, to allow long-term persistence of inhabiting species the number of old oaks should be increased. Areas where such an increase is most urgent could be identified based on species occurrence data and current habitat density, but because species data will always be incomplete data on the historical habitat distribution is valuable.

AB  - To increase the efficacy of agri-environmental schemes (AES), as well as farmers' environmental engagement, practitioners are increasingly turning to collective forms of agri-environmental management. As yet, empirical evidence from such approaches is relatively scarce. Here, we examined a farmland bird conservation project coordinated by BirdLife Sweden, the Swedish Volunteer & Farmer Alliance (SVFA). The key features of the SVFA were farmland bird inventories from volunteering birdwatchers and on-farm visits to individual farmers from conservation advisors for guidance on AES as well as unsubsidised practices. Using an ex-post application of the theory of planned behaviour across project participants and a randomly sampled control group of farmers we assessed how SVFA affected behavioural intentions relating to AES and unsubsidised conservation, and how the behaviour was affected by attitudes, perceived social norms and perceived behavioural control. We also included a measure of self, identity as a conservationist to assess its importance for behavioural intentions, and if SVFA stimulated this self-identity. SVFA farmers reported greater commitment to implementing AES and unsubsidised conservation, as compared to the control group. However, greater commitment was associated with more positive attitudes for unsubsidised conservation only and not for AES, underlining the inability of existing AES to prompt intrinsic motivation. There were also differences between farmers within SVFA, where farmers applying to the project were motivated by social influences, while farmers recruited by project managers were motivated by their personal beliefs regarding nature conservation. Finally, farmers' self-perceived ability to perform practices (i.e. perceived behavioural control) was important for their commitment to implementing AES as well as unsubsidised practices. Therefore, increasing farmers' awareness regarding the availability and, not least, practicability of available conservation options may be the key to successful biodiversity conservation in agricultural systems.

AB  - For conservation of forest biodiversity, dead wood in the form of logs, snags, or cut high stumps is sometimes left or created when forests are harvested. In Scandinavia, such dead wood usually comes from conifers. For forests in temperate regions, few studies have analysed composition and species richness of beetles using dead wood of oaks (Quercus spp). In this study in southern Sweden, I examined the occurrence of saproxylic beetles trapped at lying (logs) and standing (snags) dead wood of European oaks (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) in 13 oak-rich mixed forests of relatively high conservation value. The assemblage of beetles differed strikingly between the lying and standing dead wood. Traps on lying dead wood, compared to traps on standing dead wood, had more fungivores and fewer primary and secondary wood boring species. Of 94 species tested for individual substrate preferences, 48 showed prevalence for different trap/substrate types. Absolute species richness was significantly higher on logs than snags, but a smaller proportion of the snag substrate or snag beetles may have been sampled. For red-listed beetles, no differences in their species richness were detected among substrates. These results suggest that logs of dead oaks are valuable and that both snags and logs of oak should be retained and, if needed, created in forestry, such that they are continuously available in stands.

AB  - A model for ecological landscape planning of forestry in areas dominated bg non-industrial forest estates is described. The model, which was developed in cooperation with the 41 forest owners in a 2910 ha forest landscape in North Sweden, is based on forest conditions and the attitudes of the forest owners in the landscape. The model is named the Stream Model because streams are key components in the planning process, which comprises seven steps. Five of these steps deal with protection or management for enhancing conservation values in selected (1) zones along streams, (2) mature stands, (3) stands in which self-thinning has started, (4) stands with deciduous trees, and (5) forested non-productive sites. Then. where feasible, a selection of protected stands is connected with stream corridors. In the final step, silviculture is assigned for the matrix. Application of the model in the studied landscape resulted in 3.4% of the forest land being voluntarily set aside by the forest owners. Stream buffer zones had a large impact on the proportion of estates with set-aside areas.

AB  - Afforestation is gaining popularity as a climate mitigation policy in many countries, including high latitude regions such as Norway. However, the impacts of afforestation on local-to-regional climate is poorly understood. This study uses the Weather Research and Forecasting model to investigate the biogeophysical impacts of different forestry scenarios on the local-to-regional climate of Norway. The forestry scenarios considered are the conversion of open spaces to either evergreen forest by active afforestation or to mixed forest by natural succession. Results show both forestry scenarios lead to additional warming of surface temperatures in winter and spring (between 1.0 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C) and cooling in summer (between -1.6 degrees C and -1.3 degrees C). A temperature decomposition analysis shows that the warming in winter and spring is driven by surface albedo changes while summer cooling is driven by changes in sensible heat fluxes for afforestation and surface albedo for natural succession. Maximum 2 m air temperature increases considerably in spring in both forestry scenarios (similar to 0.8 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C). Analysis of precipitation, multiple climate indices and extremes, reveal little or no response to the different forestry scenarios. The largest societally relevant response to the forestry scenarios is the partial mitigation of the reduction in snow days expected from global warming by 10-20 days. This suggests that implementing current afforestation policies for climate mitigation in Norway may adversely exacerbate some effects of global warming locally while mitigating others. As such, the impacts of afforestation on the local-to-regional climate at high latitudes are complex and cannot support or dismiss afforestation as a climate mitigation policy.

AB  - More than 70% of the European population live in urban areas, and the level of urbanisation is steadily increasing. As a result urban and peri-urban woodlands are decreasing due to infill development within cities and sprawl (or expansion) outside cities, respectively. However, comparative assessments of urban woodland resources at international and national levels are lacking. We used GIS analyses to quantify the proportion of urban woodlands in 100 Swedish cities with >10000 inhabitants. Field surveys were used to measure vegetation structure in 474 urban woodlands across an urban gradient in a subset of 34 cities. Our results showed that the proportion of the city area comprised of urban woodland varied between I and 40% with an average of 20%. Commuter cities close to the largest cities and cities with stable populations had higher proportion of urban woodland than cities with large population increase. Urban and peri-urban woodlands cover an area larger than the total area of protected forests in Sweden and had higher amounts of dead wood than typical non-protected forests. Thus, these woodlands are potential areas supporting conservation of species depending on dead wood. Commuter cities are expected to have a large population increase in the upcoming years, which may lead to further fragmentation of urban woodlands in these cities. Management greatly affected the vegetation structure in woodlands across the urban gradient. and decision makers and urban planners need to be informed about the ecological consequences of different management actions.

AB  - The relationship between land-use and floristic diversity in the landscape, for the last millennia, is analysed from two small lakes in southern Sweden. Pollen analysis and the Local Vegetation Estimates (LOVE) model are used to quantify land-cover at local scales with 100-year time windows. Floristic richness is estimated using palynological richness, and we introduce LOVE-based evenness as a proxy for floristic evenness on a local scale based on the LOVE output. The results reveal a dynamic land-use pattern, with agricultural expansion during the 13th century, a partly abandoned landscape around AD 1400, re-establishment during the 15th-17th centuries and a transition from traditional to modern land-use during the 20th century. We suggest that the more heterogeneous landscape and the more dynamic land-use during the 13th-19th centuries were of substantial importance for achieving the high floristic diversity that characterises the traditional landscape. Pollen-based studies of this type are helpful in identifying landscape characteristics and land-use practices that are important for floristic diversity and may therefore guide the development of ecosystem management strategies aiming at mitigating the on-going loss of species seen in the landscape of southern Sweden and many other regions worldwide.

AB  - Burnets were surveyed in 100 semi-natural pastures in the province of Ostergotland, southeastern Sweden. We analysed the presence/absence of burnets in relation to habitat characteristics, and species richness of butterflies and plants. Five species were found (Adscita statices, Zygaena osterodensis, Z. viciae, Z. filipendulae and Z. lonicerae), all occurring in 33%-36% of the localities. Among these, four are nationally red-listed. More species were found on (1) large semi-natural pastures, compared with small, (2) low- to medium-grazed semi-natural pastures, compared with heavily grazed, and (3) open semi-natural pastures, compared with wooded. A. statices and Z. viciae had a higher frequency of occupancy at localities surrounded by a large density of pastures, but the occurence of the other species did not rely on this variable. The number of burnet species per locality was positively correlated with the number of butterfly species, and slightly positively correlated with species richness of plants. The difference in species richness among burnets, butterflies and plants may be explained by different responses to grazing pressure; the species richness of burnets and butterflies peaked in localities with a low grazing pressure, while species richness of plants was unaffected by grazing. As burnets are easily surveyed and indicate a high butterfly-species richness, they may be suitable indicators of species richness of pastures. As uniform management with heavy grazing is detrimental for burnets and for many butterflies, it should be avoided at localities with a species-rich fauna.

AB  - In Finland, forests are both one of the main national economic resources and the main source of biodiversity. Lack of detailed empirical evidence of how forestry affects biodiversity limits the development of sustainable forest management. Previous studies have found that the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is a keystone species in mature coniferous boreal forests, and that its presence is associated with high local biodiversity. To understand how timber harvest affect goshawk nest-stand constancy and nest occupancy, we analyzed changes in nine landscape classes in two buffer zones (100 m, 250 m) around goshawk nests in Western Finland during 2005-2013. Patterns of nest occupancy and nest stand loss during 2005-2013 was compared with corresponding data from 1999-2005 to investigate possible long-term changes in the same. We found a positive connection between the proportion of mature spruce forest and nest occupancy. Nest stand constancy was at a lower level during 2005-2013 than during 1999-2005. This was mainly because of forest loss due to cutting of nest stands. Given that the loss of goshawk nest stands has accelerated and because timber harvest in the area was found to be specifically targeted towards forest types favoured by goshawks, forestry may have an even larger negative effect on biodiversity locally than previously thought given that goshawk nest stands are associated with high biodiversity. To render the Finnish forestry ecologically sustainable, we propose that protection of goshawk nest stands should be an integrated part of standard forestry practices in the future.

AB  - Developing a general, predictive understanding of ecological systems requires knowing how much structural and functional relationships can cross scales and contexts. Here, we introduce the CROSSLINK project that investigates the role of forested riparian buffers in modified European landscapes by measuring a wide range of ecosystem attributes in stream-riparian networks. CROSSLINK involves replicated field measurements in four case-study basins with varying levels of human development: Norway (Oslo Fjord), Sweden (Lake Malaren), Belgium (Zwalm River), and Romania (Arge River). Nested within these case-study basins include multiple, independent stream-site pairs with a forested riparian buffer and unbuffered section located upstream, as well as headwater and downstream sites to show cumulative land-use impacts. CROSSLINK applies existing and bespoke methods to describe habitat conditions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Here, we summarize the approaches used, detail protocols in supplementary materials, and explain how data is applied in an optimization framework to better manage tradeoffs in multifunctional landscapes. We then present results demonstrating the range of riparian conditions present in our case-study basins and how these environmental states influence stream ecological integrity with the commonly used macroinvertebrate Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index. We demonstrate that a qualitative index of riparian integrity can be positively associated with stream ecological status. This introduction to the CROSSLINK project shows the potential for our replicated study with its panoply of ecosystem attributes to help guide management decisions regarding the use of forested riparian buffers in human-impacted landscapes. This knowledge is highly relevant in a time of rapid environmental change where freshwater biodiversity is increasingly under pressure from a range of human impacts that include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.

AB  - The biodiversity decline and the habitat Loss in the agricultural Landscape have brought up the importance of nature conservation. In the managed landscape with many Landowners and other stakeholders there is a great need for a common agreement on the aims and the means of nature conservation. Farmers' attitudes and knowledge about nature and nature conservation will affect the farms effect of the surrounding environment. Our study focuses on these attitudes and how that affects biodiversity on the farm. Sixteen Swedish farmers have been interviewed and biodiversity inventories have been conducted on their farms. The definition of nature conservation differs greatly within and between stakeholder groups and that might Lead to severe communication problems. Keywords in the definition of nature conservation were to conserve, to manage, or to exploit (in a sustainable way) nature. The choice of word is reflected on the management of the farm and the conservation actions taken. The farmers have a deep and broad awareness and knowledge of their land but this is seldom recognized by nature conservation administration. The tack of respect of their knowledge makes the farmers uneasy. Farmers are not a homogenous group but unique individuals but nature conservation is often general. Can it be flexible enough to fulfil requirements of different organisms and stakeholder interests? Sustainable nature conservation in the agricultural Landscape can only be achieved with a continuous dialog between stakeholders. The dialog ought to be open-minded and the participants have to respect and acknowledge each others knowledge and interest.

AB  - Many species that are typical of calcareous, semi-natural grasslands ("typical grassland species") are declining in Europe as a result of habitat-loss and-fragmentation. Whereas populations of these species are expected to be largest in old semi-natural grasslands, these species may also occur in successional grasslands on previously arable fields. We used a space-for-time approach to analyse changes in the frequencies of typical grassland species, and changes in soil properties, over a 280-year arable-to-grassland succession within a Swedish landscape. Our study revealed that a number of typical grassland species had higher frequencies in mid-successional (50279 years) than in old (>= 280 years) grasslands. Mid-successional grasslands also contained many of the typical grassland species that were present in old grasslands, but at lower frequencies, and had soil conditions similar to those of old grasslands. Early-successional (5-14 and 15-49 years) grasslands contained few typical grassland species. In highly fragmented landscapes, mid-successional grasslands provide additional habitat for many typical grassland species, and can function as temporary refugia ("substitute habitat") for these species until old grasslands are "restored". The overall population sizes of some typical grassland species and red-listed species are likely to be substantially increased by the presence of mid-successional grasslands within the landscape. Our study suggests that, rather than focussing solely on old grassland fragments, conservation strategies for typical grassland species should adopt a dynamic, landscape-based perspective that recognizes the role of successional grasslands. Ensuring a continuous development of mid-successional grasslands is expected to be beneficial for populations of many typical grassland species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial segregation of different forest landscape functions can accommodate rival forestry objectives more comprehensively than integrated approaches. Russia has a unique history of forest zoning separating production and environmental functions. However, the Russian Forest Code of 2006 increased the focus on wood production. We reviewed the history of zoning policy in Russia and assessed if the recent policy change affected logging rates and conservation of riparian forests. Using Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we specifically assessed (i) if policy change led to increased logging near streams, (ii) if logging rates were different in headwaters vs. main rivers, and (iii) how logging changed among catchments with different accessibility to logging. Using a global open-access remote sensing dataset, we compared mean annual forest loss as a proxy of logging rates in 10 large forested catchments in the Komi Republic in one period with strict zoning policy (2000-2006) and one with moderate zoning policy (2007-2014). Harvesting rate was positively related to the distance from streams. On the other hand, it increased after the policy change in the buffer zone but decreased outside it. Forests were harvested more in headwater buffers than along larger rivers, and harvest in the catchments near industries was higher and increasing; remote catchments had low forest loss. We discuss the opportunity for adopting forest zoning policy in different governance contexts.

AB  - Oaks (Quercus robur) can reach a considerable age, which makes them an important substrate for many epiphytic lichens, including several red-listed species. We studied the importance of tree size and other environmental factors for the occurrence of six epiphytic lichens at two sites, in southeastern Sweden, differing in quality as judged by tree size distribution and number of old trees. The effects of tree circumference, light availability, trunk inclination and site were analysed. Results showed that different lichen species responded differently to these factors, but, overall, tree size was most important for lichen occurrence. Five species showed a positive relation to tree size, but the 50% probability of occurrence was reached at different tree sizes among these species and there were also site differences. This study shows that the maintenance of old trees is crucial for several lichen species, which highlights the importance of long-term management plans.

AB  - Achieving a smart green and integrated transport system is key to sustaining and developing the economic, social and environmental vitality of urban Europe. Within this context the challenge is to deliver the next generation of infrastructure governance, design, management and operation that enables optimal accessibility, liveability and vitality across the various scales: from the local daily urban system to the wider EU-regions that cluster metropolitan areas. To tackle this challenge, a research programme has been developed for EU's Horizon 2020 - Networking for Urban Vitality (NUVit) - that focuses on the integration of the planning of multi-modal transport infrastructure with land-use planning. This paper discusses best practices amongst Europe of such integrated infrastructure planning - including cases from The Netherlands, Sweden, Estonia, Belgium. On basis of a benchmark we do an analysis addressing such issues as: spatial concepts (multi-modal corridors, nodal development); multi-modal network optimisation at various spatial scales; life-cycle issues; value creation and capturing; and, institutional and governance approaches. The paper ends by exploring the main elements of an integrated infrastructure planning approach that enables us to move forward to innovative, vital infrastructure networks and urban regions of tomorrow.

AB  - Collaboration has the potential to aid the balancing of values and goals that belong to different, sometimes competing, policy fields, such as energy, climate adaptation and nature conservation-a key component of sustainable governance. However, we need to know more of how collaboration can function as integrating (and integrated) components of governance systems. Three regulated Swedish rivers are used here as examples to explore factors that influence this function. The following factors are identified: transparency of value trade-offs, understanding of collaboration and governance, interplay between public sectors, integrating funding mechanisms, clarity of mandate, strategic use of networks and consistency of the governance system. As a consequence of the poor management of these factors in our case, water quality and ecology values are not integrated in strategic decision making, e.g., regarding hydropower, urban development or climate adaptation. Instead, they are considered add-ons, or "decorations". The Swedish case illustrates the meaning of the factors and their great importance for achieving sustainable governance.

AB  - This paper explores the possibility of using non-geometric cadastral maps from the 17th and 18th century together with aerial photographs from 1945 and 1981 to analyse land-cover change in south-east Sweden. Habitats rich in plant species in the European rural landscape seem to be correlated with a long continuity of management. Accurate spatial data from historical data sources are fundamental to understand patterns of vegetation and biodiversity in the present-day landscape. However, traditional methods for rectification of non-geometric maps using corresponding points from orthophotos or modern maps are not satisfying, as internal inaccuracies will remain in the maps. This study presents a method to rectify the maps by local warping, thereby eliminating geometrical irregularities. Further, the land-cover changes were calculated and presented as transition matrices. The extent of arable fields and grasslands were analysed in relation to soil characteristics and continuity of management. The results show a dynamic relation between grassland and arable field, albeit the overall proportions remained almost the same between 17th and 18th centuries: 60% grassland to 32% arable field. The most substantial changes in land-cover were prior to 1945. Today there is 18% grasslands left in the study area, while 56% of the land-cover is arable field. Approximately 8% of present-day land-cover is semi-natural grassland 300 years of age or more. Compared to 300 years ago there is only 1% grassland left on peat and 2% on clay. In contrast, grassland covers associated with bare bedrock have been fairly stable in size. All semi-natural grasslands with a long continuity of management were situated on shallow soils, less than 50 cm depth. The major conclusions from this study are that (i) correctly rectified, old maps are very useful to address questions of land-cover changes in historical time, (ii) general trends in land use over 300 years in this hemi-boreal landscape seem to underestimate the full dynamics of land use change, and (iii) only a small proportion of the semi-natural grassland area had a 300 year continuity of management.

AB  - Aapa mires are waterlogged northern peatland ecosystems characterized by a patterned surface structure where water-filled depressions ('flarks') alternate with drier hummock strings. As one of the EU Habitat Directive priority habitats, aapa mires are important for biodiversity and carbon cycling, harbouring several red-listed species and supporting unique species communities. Due to their sensitivity to hydrological disturbances, reliable, up-to-date and systematic information on the hydrological condition and responses of mires is crucial and required for multiple purposes ranging from carbon exchange modelling to EU Habitats Directive reporting and conservation and ecosystem restoration planning. Here, we demonstrate the usability of Sentinel-2 satellite data in a semi-automatic cloud-based approach to retrieve large-scale information on aapa mire hydrological variability. Two satellite-derived metrics, soil moisture index and the extent of water-saturated surfaces based on pixel-wise classification, are used to quantify monthly and interannual wetness variation between 2017 and 2020 across Natura 2000 aapa mires in Finland, including responses to the extreme drought of 2018. The results revealed high temporal variability in wetness, particularly in the southern parts of the aapa mire zone and generally in the late summer months interannually. Observations from the drought summer showed that one third of usually year-round wet flark surfaces may be exposed to drying during climatic extremes. Responses varied between sites and regions, implicating the significance of environmental factors for drought resistance: some sites maintained high levels of moisture, whereas others lost wet surfaces completely. Our study provides the first comprehensive national-level representation of seasonal and interannual wetness variability and drought-sensitivity of pristine aapa mire sites. The approach and methods used here can be directly upscaled outside protected areas and to other EU countries. Thus, they provide a means for harmonized, systematic large-scale monitoring of this priority habitat, as well as valuable information for other applications supporting peatland conservation and research.

AB  - The knowledge of demography and abundance of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius in Sweden in different habitats is poor. The hazel dormouse is classified as care-demanding on the national Red List in Sweden. In this study, dormice were live-trapped in a temporary mixed high shrub habitat in South-central Sweden, in order to estimate density and survival, and to evaluate a trap-based capture-mark-recapture method. Data on different trapping efforts suggested that 175 trap nights per ha were required for trapping most adults. The method seemed to be applicable for studies of dormice under natural conditions. The density of dormice was estimated at seven individuals per hectare. The average adult year-to-year survival rate was 56%-74%, which is higher than previously reported for this species. In our study, the trapping area should preferably be larger than 3.2 ha to avoid edge effects on density and survival estimates. To conclude, factors related to the survival of adult dormice might be important for the viability of populations.

AB  - Whether and how to intervene in nature to maintain or restore values is a contested issue among scholars within ecological restoration, protected area management and environmental ethics, but also among the practitioners and public officials who shape how nature is actually managed. This article analyses how the issue of intervention is debated in the case of protected forest area management in Sweden, a country with a traditionally strong preservationist discourse centred on maintaining areas as 'untouched' as possible. The analysis shows how this traditional view is challenged by a more interventionist discourse centred on adaptive management for biodiversity, but also how there are still attempts to reaffirm a preservationist discourse and practice. The implications of this as-yet-unsettled debate are discussed, concluding by pointing to a need to examine critically not only the older preservationist discourse and 'naturalness', but also the ascendant interventionist discourse and 'biodiversity'.

AB  - In the context of implementing the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) approximately 17% of the German forest area was designated in "Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)". Amongst these there are many beech forests which were not subject to a special protection status before.
   Management plans, containing measures for the protection of SACs, are just being developed. These measures may cause restrictions to forest management leading to losses of income. Our study aimed to analyse natural and economic impacts of the implementation of the Habitats Directive which could, e.g. be used as a basis for designing compensation schemes.
   In discussion with operational managers it became clear that the measures most restrictive to forest enterprises were small-area land set-aside, restrictions in choice of tree-species and maintenance of a sufficient share of mature stands.
   The impact of those nature protection measures on case-study forest enterprises was evaluated using an excel-based simulation model which enabled the calculation of, e.g., income losses based on enterprise individual data for a given simulation-period.
   The main factors influencing income losses were age-class distributions, management practices and objectives of forest enterprises. Annual income losses for the enterprises averaged 31 to 39 (sic)/ha. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Global climate change is predicted to raise water temperatures and alter flow regimes in northern river systems. Climate-related factors might have profound impacts on survival, reproduction and distribution of freshwater species such as red-listed noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) in its northern limit of distribution.
   2. In this study, noble crayfish capture data over 27 years from the River Ljungan, Sweden, were examined. Time series of catch per unit effort (CPUE) were analysed in relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, regional weather factors and water flow. CPUE was assumed to reflect differences in population size. Two models were constructed to explore the relative impact of different climate factors and density dependence on variability of catch sizes.
   3. The most parsimonious model for CPUE time series, explaining 72% of the variance in CPUE, included density-dependent population dynamics of the crayfish and climate or weather factors. The specific effect from density dependence in the model was 37%, while climate/weather factors contributed with 35% of the variation. The most important climate/weather factors are variations in NAO index and water flow. Temperature did not improve the model fit to capture data.
   4. The best model was evaluated using independent data sets that gave correlations between model predictions and data ranging from 0.44 to 0.53. The density dependence shows a time lag of 1 year, while climate variables show time lags from 2 to 6 years in relation to CPUE, indicating effects on different cohorts of the crayfish population.
   5. Both density dependence and climatic factors play a significant role in population fluctuations of noble crayfish. A 6-year time lag for NAO index is puzzling but indicates that some as yet unidentified factors related to NAO might act on the juvenile stages of the population. Water flow shows a 2-year lag to the CPUE, and high flow in the river may affect adult survival. The reasons for fluctuation of crayfish catches in response to climate need to be identified, and fishing quotas should consider the different cohort sizes because of variation in environment. Reintroduction programmes for crayfish need to consider effects of climate change when designing management strategies.

AB  - 1. Because predators threaten the survival of endangered prey in many places, predator management is a widespread conservation tool. At the same time, the effects of predators on their prey are greatly influenced by landscape structure. Therefore, the management of landscapes could be an alternative to predator regulation.
   2. A spatially explicit presence/absence model (a stochastic one-layer cellular automaton) was used to investigate two different predator-prey systems that were subject to changes in the number and size of habitat patches in a model landscape.
   3. The first scenario included grey-sided voles Clethrionomys rufocanus, Norwegian lemmings Lemmus lemmus and small mustelids (stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis) interacting in a tundra landscape. In the second scenario, the effect of habitat perforation by human settlements with subsidized predators (house cats Felis silvestris catus) on the dynamics of lemmings (as surrogate for endangered prey) was studied.
   4. Both the total area of lemming habitat and the degree of fragmentation were important determinants of the population size and persistence of lemmings. A qualitative change in the effect of fragmentation was observed when the area of lemming habitat decreased from 70% (positive effect) to 50% (negative effect). When lemming habitat covered 50% or less of the landscape, fragmentation had a negative effect on lemming population size and viability, even though habitat area did not decrease.
   5. The spatial configuration of settlements as predator sources was important. A few evenly spaced predator sources had less negative effect on lemming populations than the same proportion of predator habitat that was randomly distributed, which in turn had less effect than many evenly spaced patches.
   6. Including predator management in the model did not decrease the predators' negative impact on the population size and persistence of the endangered prey when settlements occurred in many small patches.
   7. It is concluded that predator management is not a viable strategy to combat the threat to the survival of endangered prey, but that careful planning of landscape pattern could compensate for negative predation effects. The location and size of patches of predator habitat should be optimized in order to minimize the negative effects of predators visiting adjacent areas of natural habitat.

AB  - The making of high-stumps to benefit wood living organisms is a common practice in Scandinavian forestry. To minimise the cost of this action trees of low quality, e.g. rotten trees, are chosen if possible. In this study we investigated if the wood decay fungi Heterobasidion spp. affects saproxylic beetles assemblages in Norway spruce (Picea abies) high-stumps. In total we caught 43 species of saproxylic beetles (Coleoptera) of which one was red-listed. Associations with the fungi were tested on 13 beetle species and three of them showed negative associations with the occurrence of Heterobasidion, while none of the tested species showed a positive association with Heterobasidion. Species richness did not differ between infected (30) and non-infected (33) stumps, but the beetle assemblages differed to some extent. Two additional bracket fungi species were found on some of the high-stumps, Fomitopsis pinicola and Trichaptum spp. Both these fungi had beetle species significantly associated with them. Interestingly, we found that F pinicola and Trichaptum spp. never occurred together in the same stumps. None of them, however, seemed to be affected by presence of Heterobasidion spp. In conclusion, Heterobasidion spp. infections influence the beetle fauna by disfavouring some beetle species but we did not find any species positively associated with Heterobasidion spp. This suggests that increasing the proportion of pre-rotten high-stumps could have a negative effect on beetle diversity on clear-cuts.

AB  - Loss of biodiversity is accelerating, including the loss of genetic diversity. Conservation of small, isolated populations may be important, as they can provide valuable contributions to overall genetic variation and long-term viability of species. Furthermore, such populations may play an essential role in adaptation to new environments following changes in e.g. land-use and climate. Dracocephalum ruyschiana is a threatened plant species throughout its European distribution, but 25% of the European populations are situated within Norway. Therefore, the species has its own action plan in Norway, which includes demographic monitoring. However, this monitoring does not cover genetic variation nor is the selection of monitored populations based on genetic differentiation, therefore this fundamental level of biodiversity is overlooked. We analyzed 43 sites using 96 SNPs developed for D. ruyschiana, to investigate whether the monitored populations cover the genetic variation and differentiation found within the Norwegian distribution. The results show structuring and differentiation between populations and indicate that there are at least four distinct genetic groups, of which only two are covered extensively by current demographic monitoring. We suggest that two sites representing the two other genetic groups should be included in the national monitoring program to better conserve the genetic variation found in the Norwegian population of D. ruyschiana. Overall, our results highlight the importance of an integrated, interdisciplinary framework to better monitor and conserve biodiversity at several levels.

AB  - This paper examines the potential impact of climate change on grassland butterfly species in Finland. It combines multiple climate change scenarios and different impact models for bioclimatic suitability to capture multi-faceted aspects of uncertainty. It also evaluates alternative options to enhance the adaptation of grassland biodiversity. Due to the long-term decline of semi-natural grasslands, their current extent in Finland is much lower than the minimum level estimated to ensure the survival of butterfly species. Projected locations of the climatically most suitable areas for butterfly species varied considerably between different modelling techniques and climate change scenarios. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account in planning adaptation responses. Analysis of potential adaptation options considered the promotion of existing measures based on the agri-environmental scheme (AES), as well as new measures, including species translocation and dispersal corridors. Current AES options were compared using a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The CEA results indicated that buffer zones are the most cost-effective AES measure, although environmental fallows and buffer zones had broadly similar cost-effectiveness. The cost of translocation was relatively modest compared to that of dispersal corridors, due to the high number of habitat stepping stones required along potential dispersal corridors. A questionnaire survey of Finnish farmers revealed that a third of the respondents supported increases in nature conservation. Thus, large increases of the uptake of biodiversity-related AES measures among farmers may prove to be difficult. Given the small areas currently assigned for such measures, the prospects for the adaptation of grassland butterflies to climate change in Finland appear unfavourable.

AB  - Natural disturbance dynamics, such as fire, have a fundamental control on forest composition and structure. Knowledge of fire history and the dominant drivers of fire are becoming increasingly important for conservation and management practice. Temporal and spatial variability in biomass burning is examined here using 170 charcoal and 15 fire scar records collated throughout Fennoscandia and Denmark. The changing fire regime is discussed in relation to local biogeographical controls, regional climatic change, anthropogenic land use and fire suppression. The region has experienced episodic variability in the dominant drivers of biomass burning throughout the Holocene, creating a frequently changing fire regime. Early Holocene biomass burning appears to be driven by fuel availability. Increased continentality during the mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum coincides with an increase in fire. The mid-late Holocene front-like spread of Picea abies (Norway spruce) and cooler, wetter climatic conditions reduce local biomass burning before the onset of intensified anthropogenic land use, and the late Holocene increase in anthropogenic activity created artificially high records of biomass burning that overshadowed the natural fire signal. An economic shift from extensive subsistence land use to agriculture and forestry as well as active fire suppression has reduced regional biomass burning. However, it is proposed that without anthropogenic fire suppression, the underlying natural fire signal would remain low because of the now widespread dominance of P. abies.

AB  - Vicia pisiformis L. is a perennial leguminous plant with a main distribution in broadleaved forest-steppes of eastern Europe. The species is classified as endangered (EN) according to the IUCN red-lists in both Norway and Sweden, due to severe fragmentation, small population sizes and continuing population decline. The populations on the Scandinavian Peninsula constitute the northern limit of the species distribution and are mostly restricted to warm stony slopes with predominantly southern aspects. In this study we used the AFLP method, which is a high-resolution genetic fingerprint method. Samples were collected from 22 Scandinavian populations. The overall genetic structure was analysed in an AMOVA, in a Mantel test and through constrained correspondence analysis (CCA). The ordination scores representing non-geographic genetic divergence were extracted from the CCA and analysed in a linear model using habitat variables and population size as explanatory variables.
   We found (i) a strong geographic structure, (ii) significant genetic divergence between populations, (iii) that this genetic divergence remained significant even after removing the effect of geography in a partial CCA and (iv) that the remaining non-geographic part of genetic divergence (distance from the ordination centre) was associated with aspect, populations with a northern aspect were more genetically divergent. Aspect explains more variation than population size and is the only variable retained in the minimal adequate model. We suggest that local adaptation has caused this divergence from an expected geographical pattern of genetic variation. This explanation is further supported by the association between aspect and specific AFLP fragments.

AB  - Forest biomass is a renewable resource that is increasingly utilised for bioenergy purposes in Sweden, which along with the extraction of industrial wood may conflict with biodiversity conservation. The aim of this paper is to present a method for integrated sustainability assessment of forest biomass extraction, particularly from bioenergy and biodiversity perspectives. The landscape simulator LandSim was developed and linked with models for the assessment of biomass yields and habitat networks representing prioritised biodiversity components. It was applied in a case study in Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. Forest growth and management were simulated for the period 2010-2110, following two land zoning scenarios, one applying even-aged forest management on all forest land except for protected areas (EAF-tot), and one applying continuous cover forest management on parts of the forest land, combined with protected areas and an intensified even-aged management on the other parts (CCF-int). The EAF-tot scenario implied higher yields of biomass feedstock for bioenergy, the CCF-int scenario only giving 66% of that yield, while the CCF-int scenario performed substantially better when it came to the habitat network indicators, if habitat suitability was ensured. Conclusively, the case study confirmed that the modelling framework of the LEcA tool, linking the landscape simulator LandSim with the biomass yield assessment and the habitat network model can be used for integrating main policy concerns when assessing renewable energy options.

AB  - Forest pastures, like many other semi-natural (traditional) rural biotopes, have undergone a drastic decline both in area and quality during the last century in many areas. We explored the bryophyte flora of Finnish coniferous forest pastures on acidic soil and aimed to recognize the most important microsites (rocks, coarse woody debris, tree bases, mineral soil patches and closed vegetation) for bryophyte diversity. The effects of microhabitat heterogeneity (microsite entropy) on bryophytes was also examined. We found altogether 83 bryophyte species. The only red-listed species, Tayloria tenuis, was frequently found on dung patches and a few rare ruderal species grew exclusively on bare mineral soil. Rocks comprised the most species rich microsite and many common forest floor species showed preference for this microsite. Microhabitat heterogeneity explained bryophyte species richness on both alpha (plot average) and gamma (pasture total) scales. The results suggest that certain individual bryophyte species and their microsites should be taken into account in the management of this biotope, rather than guiding the management solely on the basis of the overall bryophyte diversity.

AB  - Surface albedo is an important physical attribute of the climate system and satellite retrievals are useful for understanding how it varies in time and space. Surface albedo is sensitive to land cover and structure, which can vary considerably within the area comprising the effective spatial resolution of the satellite-based retrieval. This is particularly true for MODIS products and for topographically complex regions, such as Norway, which makes it difficult to separate the environmental drivers (e.g., temperature and snow) from those related to land cover and vegetation structure. In the present study, we employ high resolution datasets of Norwegian land cover and structure to spectrally unmix MODIS surface albedo retrievals (MCD43A3 v6) to study how surface albedo varies with land cover and structure. Such insights are useful for constraining land cover-dependent albedo parameterizations in models employed for regional climate or hydrological research and for developing new empirical models. At the scale of individual land cover types, we found that the monthly surface albedo can be predicted at a high accuracy when given additional information about forest structure, snow cover, and near surface air temperature. Such predictions can provide useful empirical benchmarks for climate model predictions made at the land cover level, which is critical for instilling greater confidence in the albedo-related climate impacts of anthropogenic land use/land cover change (LULCC).

AB  - While wind energy remains a preferred source of renewable energy, understanding the full spectrum of impacts are vital to balance climate-related benefits against their costs to biodiversity. Environmental impact assessments often fail to assess cumulative effects at larger spatial scales. In this respect, life cycle assessments are better suited, but have to date mainly focused on greenhouse gas emissions and energy accounting. Here, we adapt a recent global life-cycle impact assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate collision, disturbance and habitat loss impacts of onshore wind energy development on bird species richness in Norway. The advantage of a local model for Norway is that it enables employing species distribution models to more accurately estimate the potential distribution area of species. This facilitates more realistic site- and species-specific assessments of potential impacts within a local scale but excludes habitat ranges outside Norway. Furthermore, a new characterization factor was developed for potential barrier effects. Larger onshore wind-power plants overall had greater sitespecific potentially disappeared fractions (PDF) of species, while smaller plants were less efficiently located with greater impacts per GWh. Overall, Norwegian wind-power plants were sited least efficiently (PDF/GWh) regarding indirect habitat loss (2.186 x 10-9) and disturbance (1.219 x 10-9), followed by direct habitat loss (0.932 x 10-9), and finally collisions (0.040 x 10-9) and barriers (0.310 x 10-9). Vulnerability differed among bird groups with seabirds, raptors and waterfowl emerging as the most impacted groups (e.g. 5.143 x 10-9, 3.409 x 10-9 and 3.139 x 10-9 PDF/GWh for disturbance, respectively); highlighting the sympatric distribution of their habitats and the majority of Norway's onshore wind-power plants. Current practice has not succeeded in avoiding sites with higher impacts for birds, fuelling conflicts surrounding environmental concerns of onshore wind energy development in Norway. Operative LCA models can help decision-makers assessing localized lifecycle environmental impacts to support environmental-friendly wind energy production in specific regions.

AB  - Plant species richness in central and northern European seminatural grasslands is often more closely linked to past than present habitat configuration, which is indicative of an extinction debt. In this study, we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be found in clear-cuts after at least 80years as coniferous production forest by comparing floras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits reflecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land use. Clear-cuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36% higher species richness and 35% higher richness of grassland indicator species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory, compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction debts of the flora, these young forests offer opportunities for grassland restoration at large scales. Our study supports the concept of remnant populations and highlights the importance of considering historical land use for understanding the distribution of grassland plant species in fragmented landscapes, as well as for policy-making and conservation.

AB  - Riverine biodiversity in Europe is under threat from a range of anthropogenic factors. Key to effective biodiversity conservation is the public's willingness to support restoration efforts. Based on value-belief-norm (VBN) theory and using a longitudinal survey design with n = 1,000 respondents per each of four countries (France, Germany, Norway, Sweden) we measured individual conservation-oriented behaviors in natural settings over time (e.g., signing a petition, donating money) that benefit native river fish biodiversity. We also examined sociopsychological determinants of these behaviors. In addition to behavioral intentions and self-reported behaviors, we measured actual behavior (monetary donations). We found broad support for the VBN theory but also relevant cultural diversity. In France, Norway, and Sweden fish value orientations affected conservation-oriented behaviors, whereas in Germany general ecological worldviews had more explanatory power. Conservation-oriented outreach and information campaigns will be most effective when taking between-country differences in the relationship between beliefs and behaviors into account.

AB  - It is commonly agreed that landscape history is important for species distributions today. Here, we studied present-day regional population distribution and performance of four grassland species, the perennials Ranunculus bulbosus and Succisa pratensis, and the monocarpic "biennials" Carlina vulgaris and Tragopogon pratensis, in a Swedish rural landscape. We analysed the management history of their population patches, using vegetation maps from 1945 and 2001. Distributions of Succisa pratensis reflected the grassland occurrences in 1945 and Tragopogon pratensis was associated with the road network 60 years ago. Performance in different habitats also suggested an impact of land use on species distributions. For Ranunculus bulbosus and Carlina vulgaris the impact of landscape history was less obvious. Our results indicate that present-day distributions of some grassland species partly may be a legacy of previous semi-natural grassland patterns in rural Sweden, an insight that has valuable implications for assessments of long-term vulnerability of grassland species.

AB  - The decrease of old deciduous trees in northern Europe is a threat to the saproxylic fauna. In northern Europe, oak sustains the highest richness of saproxylic invertebrates, among which beetles is a large group. In order to preserve species associated with old trees, it has become common practice in commercial forestry to retain such trees at final felling. However, to create beneficial conditions for species associated with retained trees, the surrounding plantation has to be managed with regard to their specific demands. In the case of oak-associated species, including many red-listed species, several studies have shown that light is an important factor. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of increased openness around oaks (Quercus robur) in spruce plantations (Picea abies) on species richness and abundance of oak-associated saproxylic beetles. The study was performed in nine spruce plantations located in southern Sweden, with mature oaks standing in a gradient of canopy openness. Beetles were collected from 54 oaks from May to September during two seasons, using window traps. The analyses revealed that increased openness around oaks increases species richness and abundance of oak-associated beetles. By including insolation angle in the analysis, we found that it is mainly the degree of openness directed south from the oak that has positive effects on beetle richness. These findings imply that it is desirable to maintain an open area around retained oaks, and that this area should be placed on the southern side of the oak to maximize the biodiversity benefit in relation to costs for the forest owner.

AB  - The Natura 2000 (N2k) network of protected areas is a backbone of biodiversity conservation in Europe, with likely further relevance for the development of green infrastructure. EU member states have legal responsibilities for evaluating the condition of and maintaining their national networks. While it is desirable to maintain the condition of the N2k network or even improve it by habitat restoration, it is a fact that national environmental bodies operate under budgetary constraints - money available for conservation is limited. Consequently, there may be a need to prioritize targeting of conservation effort in and around the N2k network. In this study we develop a high-resolution spatial conservation prioritization for the Finnish national N2k network, using data about the distribution and quality of 68 N2k habitats occurring in Finland. The aim of the work is to identify management landscapes, landscapes that have exceptionally high conservation value and which could be managed as one management unit. We identify top-priority areas of the N2k network. We also identify highest-priority N2k areas that do not have the status of a protected area in the Finnish legislation. The present work was commissioned by the Natural Heritage Services of Metsahallitus, a national administrator that is responsible for the maintenance of the Finnish protected area network. The primary purpose of this work is to assist targeting of habitat maintenance, management and restoration in and around the Finnish N2k network. The analysis done here could be replicated elsewhere using publicly available spatial prioritization software. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The riparian spider fauna of the river Gaula near Trondheim, Central Norway, has been investigated in spring/summer 1994 by means of pitfall traps, limited sieving and hand picking. Sites varied from sand and gravel banks completely devoid of vegetation, to sand/silt deposits with or without vegetation and Salix triandra/Alnus incana forests on sandy soil. These special habitats turned out to harbour a very special and remarkable spider fauna. Two species were recorded for the first time in Fennoscandia: Arctosa stigmosa and Coviphantes saxetorum, both being the northernmost records in Europe. Two species were new to Norway: Singa nitidula and Myrmarachne formicaria, and 10 species were new regional records.
   The spider fauna of the river banks consists of the following ecological groups based on their known ecology in Norway: (1) riparian species, both psammophilous and lithophilous, (2) hygrophilous species, (3) pioneer species, (4) ubiquitous species, and (5) accidental guests from nearby habitats. Group (1) represents about 29% of the total number of species. The isolated occurrence of rare riparian species is paralleled by riparian beetles (Coleoptera). Central Norway harbours one of the richest and most diverse riparian faunas of Northern Europe.
   The river Gaula is protected by law against hydroelectric exploitation but about 65 km of the river banks have been destroyed by the construction of flood preventing walls and both riparian beetles and spiders have disappeared from many sites. Most of the riparian species are vulnerable to human disturbance and changes in the flooding pattern of the river and four are included in the Norwegian Red List with the status 'Declining, care demanding'. Protection measures include reduction of silt/sand removal, adaptation of flood preventing walls to suit the riparian fauna, reduction of leisure activities on particularly vulnerable localities and the designation of certain particularly valuable sites as Nature Reserves or Protected Sites. Clear-cutting and management of vegetation in order to maintain the open areas should also be considered.

AB  - Neither Norway nor Sweden has fulfilled international commitments to the principles of direct public involvement in nature conservation, which involve (we believe) the state adopting an 'enabling' role, mobilizing governance resources to support decentralized decision-making while retaining powers to intervene when necessary to defend important minority interests or support international objectives. We analyse four attempts to establish nature conservation areas with substantial levels of direct public involvement in the two countries and argue that in each case, flaws in the setting of the areas' boundaries, the framework for participation and conflict resolution mechanisms have undermined public involvement. Hence, there is a need to design more effective, enabling rules to encourage local actor involvement in nature conservation and resolve any political issues that arise as a consequence of such involvement, before the international commitments can be fulfilled.

AB  - Evidence for unbroken continuity of tree taxa over the last c. 13,500 years is presented from a biodiversity 'hotspot' nature reserve in south-west Sweden. Forest composition, continuity, fire and disturbance events are reconstructed using palaeoecological methods. A lake record reveals that Pinus sylvestris, Betula spp., Salix spp., Populus tremula and Hippophae rhamnoides were the initial trees scattered in a semi-open, steppe environment. This developed into forest with Pinus, Betula, Corylus, Alnus, Ulmus and Populus with evidence for frequent fires. Deciduous trees became more significant as fires became less frequent and Quercus, Fraxinus and Tilia expanded. Fire frequencies increased again in the Bronze Age probably associated with anthropogenic use of the forest, and the first Fagus sylvatica pollen was recorded. Burning continued through the Iron Age, but charcoal is briefly absent for a period often referred to as the 'Late Iron Age Lull'. The forest re-expanded with successions involving Juniperus, but with an altered composition from the earlier mixed deciduous community, to one dominated by Fagus. This is coincident with the first pollen records for Picea abies. The early Holocene mixed forest with frequent low-intensity fires is potentially associated with the greatest diversity of red-listed insect species. Forest continuity and the fragmented reservoir populations of old deciduous trees in the Fagus-dominated forest today are likely to have been critical in preserving the present-day, species-rich, rare epiphytic flora, wood-inhabiting fungi and invertebrate communities. As many of these forest fragments may become more vulnerable with future climate change, tree diversity with some disturbance may become essential for survival of the endangered saproxylic species.

AB  - This paper addresses the perceptions of actors of protected areas in Norway about a co-management regime at the local level. The analysis is based on quantitative data from surveys of actors of eight protected areas in northern Norway. The surveys were undertaken just before a change to co-management in 2010. The results show that the two strongest determinants that explain actors' initial support of the governance change as a means to alleviate conflict are (i) the relationship of actors to the protected areas in terms of knowledge of the protected areas and mental models on conservation and (ii) the economic relevance of the areas for them. Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sami), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives. We build on the quantitative findings on actors' perceptions to develop a broader discussion on the relationship of the new management model for protected areas implemented and conflict resolution on land conservation in the country.

AB  - Unsustainable use of forest resources poses a serious threat to biodiversity worldwide. This threat is particularly important in boreal biomes, where intensive production-oriented forestry is widely applied. Legislation is one of the key tools for preserving nature from anthropogenic damage. Designation of environmental legislation should be grounded on sound scientific evidence in order to be effective. We assess the impact of guidelines enforcing the Finnish ad-hoc legislation aimed at preserving breeding sites and resting places of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), a protected species in Finland and in the European Union under the Habitats Directive. Its habitat is under pressure from widespread forest clear-cutting practices. We collected data on site occupancy by breeding female flying squirrels from 81 sites spanning 12 years (2005-2016) and on relevant habitat variables around the site. Using generalized linear mixed models we quantified the predicted occupancy of breeding female flying squirrels in relation to the cover of breeding habitat around a site. We then compared the resulting habitat requirements of breeding females with the habitat that would be retained according to the initial national legislation guidelines and their proposed first revision. We show that both the initial and the proposed revision of the habitat protection guidelines allow the retention of breeding habitat patches of minimal size, which would yield a very low (less than 5%) predicted occupancy by a breeding flying squirrel female. The current revised guidelines are not science-driven and remain ineffective in safeguarding the species habitat from expanding forestry. These results expose the wide gap between science and policy for the implementation of environmental legislation, in this case the Habitats Directive, to protect species of conservation concern. There is an urgent need to fill the science-policy gap in order to achieve the preservation of biodiversity in a world under rapid transformation.

AB  - Recent urban ecological research shows high species numbers in slowly developed cities and towns. Urban development is known to fragment, change and weaken urban biodiversity. Conservation areas have been the main tool in protecting threatened species both in rural and urban municipalities in Finland. However, very little is known about how successful conservation areas are in protecting rare and threatened species and their habitats in boreal cities and towns. Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is a rapidly urbanising hemiboreal city, which has a high number of vascular plant species in both native and urban biotopes. One and 0.25 km(2) grid square maps and simple overlay methods are being used to analyse data on species occurrence and land use. Total species number, a rarity index and historical and threatened groupings are used to classify species and their habitats. At present, conservation areas can protect only a small proportion of threatened species in Helsinki. More protection areas, green areas in future land-use decisions and new management goals are needed to protect the biodiversity of existing vascular plant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The legislation enacted on wolf conservation in Finland has had a number of societal, ecological and economic implications. As the number of wolves has increased, so have the conflicts over the management of the wolf population. The debate has been heated ever since Finland joined the European Union and was committed to the Habitats Directive and the conservation goals it entailed. Despite the strict legislation on wolf conservation, the number of wolves has started to drop off again as a result of illegal hunting. The conflict situation, as well as the illegal hunting, indicates that there is a lack of legitimacy in wolf conservation. This article aims at analysing these legitimacy issues in Finnish wolf conservation by using the concept of total legitimacy as an analytical tool. The aim is both to reveal the legitimacy problems in conservation and to assess whether the concept of total legitimacy is a useful tool in analysing the legitimacy of nature conservation regulation and governance. In addition, different regulatory instruments and their potential for enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of wolf conservation are assessed.

AB  - Partial cutting is increasingly applied in European temperate oak-dominated forests for biofuel harvesting, and to counteract succession in protected stands. Effects on biodiversity of these measures need to be carefully evaluated, and species-rich but neglected taxa such as fungi should be considered. We studied the effects of partial Cutting on fungal fruiting bodies on woody debris. In 21 closed canopy forests rich in large oaks in Sweden, on average 25%-30% of the basal area was cut. Fruiting bodies were counted and some were collected in treated and control plots before and after treatment. We found 334 basidiomycete and 47 ascomycete species. Species richness of basidiomycetes declined significantly more in treated plots (on average 26%) than in control plots (on average 13%) between seasons. Species richness of ascomycetes increased by 17% in control plots and decreased by 2% in treated plots. Total species richness was significantly reduced on fine woody debris (1-10 cm in diameter), but not on coarse woody debris (> 10 cm). Overall species composition did not change significantly as a result of partial cutting, but red-listed species tended to decrease more in treated plots. We suggest that approximately 30% of the stands should not be thinned, and dead sterns and fallen branches should not be removed, to favor saproxylic fungi and their associated fauna.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Future development of bioeconomy is expected to change land use in the Nordic countries in agriculture and forestry. The changes are likely to affect water quality due to changes in nutrient run-off. To explore possible future land-use changes and their environmental impact, stakeholders and experts from four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) were consulted. The methodological framework for the consultation was to identify a set of relevant land-use attributes for agriculture and forestry, e.g. tillage conservation effort, fertiliser use, animal husbandry, biogas production from manure, forestry management options, and implementation of mitigation measures, including protection of sensitive areas. The stakeholders and experts provided their opinions on how these attributes might change in terms of their environmental impacts on water quality given five Nordic bioeconomic scenarios (sustainability, business as usual, self-sufficiency, cities first and maximizing economic growth). A compilation methodology was developed to allow comparing and merging the stakeholder and expert opinions for each attribute and scenario. The compiled opinions for agriculture and forestry suggest that the business-as-usual scenario may slightly decrease the current environmental impact for most attributes due to new technologies, but that the sustainability scenario would be the only option to achieve a clear environmental improvement. In contrast, for the self-sufficiency scenario, as well as the maximum growth scenario, a deterioration of the environment and water quality was expected for most of the attributes. The results from the stakeholder consultations are used as inputs to models for estimating the impact of the land-use attributes and scenarios on nutrient run-off from catchments in the Nordic countries (as reported in other papers in this special issue). Furthermore, these results will facilitate policy level discussions concerning how to facilitate the shift to bioeconomy with increasing biomass exploitation without deteriorating water quality and ecological status in Nordic rivers and lakes.

AB  - Agriculture near urban landscapes has recently been re-appreciated with the recognition of its economic, social and environmental contributions. However, rapid urbanisation and global agricultural restructuring constituting complex processes across multiple scales tend to threaten the survival of peri-urban agriculture. Focusing on family farms near Gothenburg in Sweden, this paper intends to explore the. relations between location and agriculture and how family farms have been able to continue farming in peri-urban areas. Unlike previous studies of peri-urban agriculture, mostly carried out by planners from an urban-centric perspective, this paper deploys a rural and place-based perspective by drawing on theories of agricultural location. Based on statistical and spatial analyses of land use change, and interviews with farmers and authorities, the processes and drivers of local agricultural change are analysed. The results identify four simultaneous processes that produce the diversity in forms of agriculture between farms: structural changes, loss of farmland to urban expansion, specialisation of on-farm activities and a niching trend of on-farm activities. The new findings which shed light on the theory of agricultural localisation are: 1) niche production greatly takes advantage of the pea-urban location; 2) a reverse von Thunen's transportation pattern is enabled by the proximity to urban consumers; 3) enhancing competitive advantage through saving labour costs is enabled by the direct relation to consumers at the peri-urban location; 4) multifunctional agriculture has potential but also raises conflicts between different types of land use in ped-urban areas; 5) a secured access to land for farmers enabled by the local governance which separates the increasing land value from land rent is fundamental for supporting continued peri-urban agriculture. Our recommendation is that policy makers need to shift to a location-sensitive governing praxis of agriculture in order to re-vitalise pea-urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - URBAN TOURISM
AB  - The city as a tourist destination is a complex system with its own specific urban and architectural features. Sustainable urban tourism and architecture are unquestionably interdependent. This paper offers an evaluation of the urban hotels in European countries and in Croatia selected according to the established criteria. The analysis of the results suggests that in EU countries, a great deal of effort has been made to raise the level of responsibility of all participants and to apply the principles of sustainable development in tourism architecture. Nevertheless, the established principles have been consistently applied in only a limited number of the analyzed cases.
   The analyses of global tourism growth indicate that urban tourism is increasingly developing. A massive influx of tourists into the cities poses considerable challenges such as: the preservation of cultural resources and the built environment, the sustainability of social interaction between local citizens and tourists, waste management, increased energy consumption, increased carbon dioxide emissions to name but a few. Urban tourism is mostly developed in cities characterized by open urban spaces, nice parks, unique architectural and urban features, attractive material and non-material heritage, efficient transport services, famous universities, scientific and research facilities, shopping malls, high-quality restaurants, dynamic street life. Cities often serve as bases to those tourists who recognize an entire region as an attractive tourist destination. International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] offered the following sustainable principles as a basis for national programs: to limit the impact on the environment up to the carrying capacity level, to preserve the existing biological resources and biodiversity, to harmonize the consumption of non-renewable resources with the use of the renewable ones, to establish a fair distribution of benefits and costs of the use of resources, to apply technological processes which enhance the usability of the resources, to adjust economic policies to the protection of natural resources, to follow the principle of anticipation and collaboration between sectors (such as tourism, traffic and environmental protection) in decision-making processes, and to enhance and support cultural values based on sustainable principles.
   The availabe data indicate that presently there are 26 cities with more than in million inhabitants while 45 cities have populations between 5 and 10 millions. Globally, 54 per cent of the world population currently (2014) lives in urban areas. It is estimated that until 2050, around 66 per cent of the world population will live in cities. The EU, with 73 per cent of its population living in the cities, ranks third among the most urbanized world regions. In order to reduce the effects of the urban areas to an ecologically acceptable level, planning and design processes should take into consideration the assessment of ecological footprint, ecological deficit, urban heat islands, the availability (i.e. restriction) of land as a resource, traffic, waste, water and air quality, aerodynamic impact, and urban dust.
   Furthermore, planning and design processes in the context of energy-efficient architecture in sustainable urban tourism, require the application of energy-efficient concepts, elements and systems such as a sustainable urban concept, carrying capacity analysis in evaluation and choice of a site, planning the use of the site in a sustainable way, a sustainable architectural concept, the application of passive solar principles in architecture, ecology-based waste management, the participation of the users etc.
   There exist numerous organizations dealing with the assessment of energy-efficient, i.e. sustainable architecture in tourism. Those that are widely known are Green Leaf, Green Seal, Green Key and Eco-label, Green Tourism Business Scheme [GTBS], China's Green Hotel Standard [CGHS], LEED and BREEAM.
   The assessment of architecture in sustainable urban tourism was in this research preceded by an analysis of the most frequently used systems and evaluation methods. There are various criteria and structures of evaluation models. Generally, the structure of evaluation models is subdivided into three main dimensions which stem from a three-column model of sustainable development: the ecological, sociological and economic dimension. The ecological dimension can be further subdivided into: environmental protection, protection of nature and characteristics of a building.
   This research encompassed 142 green hotels in Europe and Croatia. The term green hotel denotes here an overarching concept for the following: green, energy-efficient, eco, environmentally friendly, sustainable hotel etc. They were selected on the basis of the available information found in literature and on Croatian and foreign web sites, which was used as a relevant criterion in their classification as green urban hotels. The hotels are situated in 58 cities in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
   After the data obtained from the survey of the green hotels had been processed, the representative examples were selected on the basis of the following criteria: the complexity of the project, originality of design solutions, the application of energy-efficient principles in their construction or renovation in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the level of their cultural, historical and geographical similarity to Croatian context. The research results show that none of the analyzed hotels meet any group of selection criteria entirely. The representative examples used in the analysis had to fulfil at least one subcriterion within seven out of ten main criteria groups.
   The research results indicate that a great deal of effort has been made in EU to promote the so-called green tourism. Furthermore, considerable effort has been put into ecological awareness-raising and in developing an appropriate sense of responsibility of all the participants but also on the implementation of sustainable development principles in all stages of architectural creation in urban tourism. However, a "greenwashing" effect has been detected in numerous cases.

AB  - The lands in the northernmost corner of Europe present contradictory aspects in their social and economic development. Urban settlements are relatively few and small-sized, but rich natural resources (minerals, forests, rivers) attract energy-intensive industries. Energy demand is increasing as a result of new investments in mining and industries, while reliable energy supply is threatened by the planned phase out of Swedish nuclear power, the growth of intermittent power supplies and the need to reduce fossil fuel consumption, especially in the Finnish and Norwegian energy sectors. Given these challenges, this paper investigates the potentials of so far unexploited energy resources in the northern counties of Finland, Norway and Sweden by comparing and critically analyzing data from statistic databases, governmental reports, official websites, research projects and academic publications. The criteria for the technical and economic definition of potentials are discussed separately for each resource. It is concluded that, despite the factors that reduce the theoretical potentials, significant sustainable techno-economic potentials exist for most of the resources, providing important insights about the possible strategies to contribute to a positive socio-economic development in the considered regions.

AB  - Recreation activity preferences in forest settings were explored in a scene preference study. The importance of type of human intervention and the level of biodiversity for preference and intention to engage in recreation activities were examined in a sample of forestry and social science students in Sweden. Results showed that forestry students displayed an almost equally strong preference for natural-looking scenes as for scenes with traces of recreation (e. g., paths), whereas social science students preferred recreational scenes the most. Least preferred were scenes with traces of forest management. Different forest settings were furthermore preferred for different recreation activities. Recreational settings were favored for walking and going on outings, and natural-looking settings were more appreciated for picking berries or mushrooms. Respondents displayed a stronger intention to study plants and animals in high biodiversity settings and the intention to exercise was stronger in low biodiversity settings. Implications for future land use planning and forest management are discussed.

AB  - The effects of clear-cutting and potential alternatives continue to be hot topics during discussions of forestry and nature conservation. This study presents forest data from Ridon, an island in Lake Malaren in central Sweden, where forest management and clear-cutting have been applied for almost 200 years. The main objective of the study was to identify changes in forest management and forest conditions over time. The forest transition in Sweden during the 1800s is also covered, and the importance of early forest experiments is discussed, exemplified by Ridon. This study is based on eight forest management plans and maps, from 1832 to 2014. Our results show a transformation from large, continuous areas of heterogeneous forest to small homogeneous stands. Clear-cutting has been the main logging method applied to Ridon for almost 200 years, which is in contrast with the general historical trend of selective cutting preceding clear-cutting in the Nordic countries. Our analysis shows that forestry has changed from the exploitation of resources to sustainable management. Currently, forest management at Ridon aims to create a nature reserve characterized by uneven-aged forest with an increased deciduous component. Hence, the intention is to obtain a forest similar to as it was in 1832. By analyzing spatially precise data on forest stands over long periods and in relation to contemporary silvicultural methods, it is possible to discern the impact of forest management, to understand the drivers of the long-term changes in managed forest, and it also allows for a more educated discussion on today's forest management.

AB  - In this paper we address the disconnection between multiftmctional woodland management and current forestry policies in Europe, using a practice theory approach. Drawing on cases in the UK and Finland, we identified seven bundles forestry practices: creating an attractive place to live, pursuing forest-based leisure practices, wildlife and biodiversity preservation, heritage conservation, renewable heat production, animal husbandry and timber production. By assessing the place of these forest-based practices within larger practice 'complexes' (such as farming, urban employment, family recreation), we demonstrate disconnections to current incentive programmes, which are largely oriented towards professional farmers or foresters. We found that study participants were largely unopposed to achieving national policy objectives (afforestation in the UK and commercial timber production in Finland); instead, their limited active engagement reflected available competencies and the lack of resources (particularly time) available to non-commercial forest managers. We argue that using practice theory helps to identify new opportunities to influence existing practices, such as increasing competences in harvesting of continuous growth forestry in Finland and encouraging small-scale renewable heat production in the UK.

AB  - In this case study of Swedish boreal forestry, we analyze the implementation in practical management of a sustainable forest management that includes the continued capacity of ecosystems to also provide non-timber services. In the Swedish national forest policy, the equal goals of timber production and biodiversity conservation have increased the responsibility of landowners and managers to modify practical management. We compiled written information from three larger FSC-certified forestry companies combined with semi-structured interviews with forest management personnel at regional offices to map what data and information the companies collect and use. We examined to what extent obtainable information from the forest companies captures composition, structure, and function of boreal ecosystems at patch, stand and landscape scale. This was done using 47 indicators compiled from literature and grouped into five categories based on nationally identified deficiencies in the managed boreal forest compared to unmanaged forest. We found that the recording of data describing different aspects of the forest ecosystem were separated in two largely uncoordinated systems, Ecological Landscape Plans and stand registers. While there is a need for conservation-oriented data across scales, collected statistics was largely production-oriented and related to the stand scale. We also identified information gaps regarding different ecosystem structures and their spatial distribution such as dead wood and habitat networks. The knowledge base available to future management decisions also seems to lack information on connectivity in the landscape, habitat at smaller spatial scales and the effectiveness of reserved areas. To reach the ecological goals of sustainable forest management, there is a need to further coordinate existing data and information but also to fill gaps in particular regarding cross-scale information.

AB  - Small marginal habitats in the rural landscape may play an important role for plant species richness as refugias. Little is known how the surrounding landscape and landscape history influence these patterns. I analysed how plant species richness was affected by isolation, habitat area, past and present land use, and if landscape context matters. Plant species occurrence in two different types of small marginal habitats were analysed, road verges and midfield islets. The study was conducted in two different agricultural landscapes in Sweden; one open modern agricultural landscape and one traditional rural landscape, and the results compared. Present and past land use, and landscape change was analysed using aerial photographs and old maps. There was a large grassland reduction more than 50 years ago in the modern landscape, when there still were quite a lot of grasslands left in the traditional landscape. Area and connectivity were more important for plant incidence in small remnant habitats in the modem landscape, compared to the less fragmented, traditional rural landscape. On the other hand there were more grassland specialists, 23% in the traditional landscape compared to 16%. Species richness became higher on midfield islet if grazing was re-introduced. The legacy of surrounding landscape remains in the species pool for a long time, at least 50 years, even in small grassland fragments. Although small grassland remnants are more sensitive to fragmentation effects compared to larger grasslands, they still encompass a substantial part of the grassland species pool and may be valuable for reconstructing grassland management at a landscape scale.

AB  - Land use and transport integration has been considered a must-have approach in achieving sustainable urban development. However, successful applications of the concept have been few, as institutional reforms to support land use and transport integration have lagged behind. Accordingly, this article argues that understanding difficulties in land use and transport integration requires an analysis of the long-term evolution of formal and informal institutional frameworks in planning practices. For this purpose, this article presents a case study of land use and transport planning in Finland's Helsinki Metropolitan Region, which combines interview research on planners' perceptions with a document analysis of the historical trajectories of the region's plans, policy documents and related institutional and organizational changes. The historical-institutional approach of the article draws on discursive institutionalism as a novel analytical approach for studying how land use and transport integration is institutionally conditioned.

AB  - Forest ecosystems provide a variety of services, from climate regulation to biodiversity conservation. Temporary land cover variations such as those related to forest management can contribute to climate change through both biogeochemical (carbon, warming) and biophysical (albedo, cooling) mechanisms. As global rising demand for biomass for energy and materials can contribute to biodiversity losses, there is an evident need for integrated assessments of climate and biodiversity impacts to investigate possible trade-offs and synergies. We explore the integration of impacts on climate change and biodiversity from forest harvest for three case studies based on forest plantations in Norway. We focus on impacts from land disturbance after clear-cutting using three plots of one ha each of homogeneous forest in two ecoregions in Norway involving three different tree species: spruce, pine and birch. We use existing ecoregion specific characterization factors (CFs) to quantify occupation, short-term and long-term transformation impacts of land use on biodiversity loss for five taxonomic groups: mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants at regional and global level. For climate change impacts, we quantify the contributions of CO2 fluxes and changes in albedo. We estimate CFs for two complementary climate metrics, namely global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP) for time horizons of 20 and 100 years and quantify impacts in CO2 equivalents. We pursue the integration of impacts on climate and biodiversity from a time perspective: very short (GVVP20 and land occupation), medium (GWP100 and land transformation within 100 years) and long (GTP100 and land transformation after 100 years). We find CFs from -0.21 to 1.6 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for carbon emissions, and from -0.03 to -1.4 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for albedo changes, while net characterized impacts range from -44.8 t CO2-eq./ha (GTP100, spruce) to 93.25 t CO2-eq./ha (GWP20, spruce). Damages to biodiversity range from 4.76 * 10(-13) to 6.24 *10(-8) global species eq. lost per ton of carbon harvested. Our results reinforce the notion that spatially and temporally explicit analyses are vital when assessing life-cycle impacts from land derived products. We show that the existing set of multiple and complementary indicators for climate charige and biodiversity impacts can be integrated into a common framework to better inform about the complex heterogeneities of the forest ecosystem response to disturbances. We argue for a more frequent consideration of integrated impacts on biodiversity and climate change from forestry operations to better highlight possible co-benefits or adverse side-effects of forest management strategies.

AB  - Coastal areas are at the centre of human-nature relationship, shaped by recreation, tourism and aesthetic values. However, socioeconomic drivers of biodiversity change in coastal areas have received less attention. Soft sediment seafloors support diverse species communities and contribute to ecosystem functionality. One of the main threats is dredging, which sweeps resident organisms. Dredgings are commonly done to deepen waterways, but also for the purposes of private housing. The ecological impacts of these small-sized dredgings are not well known over broad environmental and geographical gradients. We developed a simple approach for spatial integration of ecological and socioeconomic system, to describe how recreational land use change contributes to the loss of marine biodiversity. It shows how human behaviour, such as preference for a location of second home, can be derived from spatial data and coupled with ecological change. We characterize typical locations of second homes based on accessibility, aesthetics and environment, and with the information identified suitable areas for new second homes. We also quantified typical areas of dredging, based on the depth and substrate of the sea floor, and the extent of the reed beds, influencing the access to properties. We then simulate an annual increase of new second homes and expected land-use change, namely dredging of shores. Finally, we quantified the realized and projected loss of marine biodiversity from dredged sites, based on species distribution models, relying on extensive ecological data collected from over 170,000 underwater sites. We found that small-sized dredging can be detrimental to coastal biodiversity, as dredging targets shallow, photic bays and lagoons, with diverse algal and aquatic plant communities, with limited recovery potential. Dredgings also had broad impacts on benthic faunal habitats, which maintain ecosystem processes and functions. Our results reveal a significant ecological change driven by recreational land use. Reversing the trend of biodiversity loss requires a holistic understanding of socioecological systems. Our results highlight the need for integrating land-sea interactions into conservation policies and reforming current land-use regulation for the benefit of marine biodiversity.

AB  - Intensive forest management has led to a population decline in many species, including those dependent on dead wood. Many lichens are known to depend on dead wood, but their habitat requirements have been little studied. In this study we investigated the habitat requirements of wood dependent lichens on coarse dead wood (diameter > 10 cm) of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris in managed boreal forests in central Sweden. Twenty-one wood dependent lichen species were recorded, of which eleven were confined to old (estimated to be > 120 years old) and hard dead wood. Almost all of this wood has emanated from kelo trees, i.e. decorticated and resin-impregnated standing pine trees that died long time ago. We found four red-listed species, of which two were exclusive and two highly associated with old and hard wood. Lichen species composition differed significantly among dead wood types (low stumps, snags, logs), wood hardness, wood age and occurrence of fire scars. Snags had higher number of species per dead wood area than logs and low stumps, and old snags had higher number of species per dead wood area than young ones. Since wood from kelo trees harbours a specialized lichen flora, conservation of wood dependent lichens requires management strategies ensuring the future presence of this wood type. Besides preserving available kelo wood, the formation of this substratum should be supported by setting aside P. sylvestris forests and subject these to prescribed burnings as well as to allow wild fires in some of these forests.

AB  - Multifunctionality has become a major objective of European agricultural policy. However, recent research concerning the multifunctionality of agriculture has focused on economic, production or abiotic factors and has paid less attention to biotic, landscape and social aspects. In addition, relationships in the form of trade-offs between different landscape values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage, recreation and aesthetics have been little studied. This case study of a farm in southern Sweden explores the synergies and conflicts that can arise between these landscape values when planning at the farm scale. The results demonstrated that it was not easy to integrate the considered landscape values in practice, though we are often asked for them in policy documents. From the case study, we developed some general relationshipssynergies and conflictsbetween biodiversity, cultural heritage, recreation and aesthetics that can occur when improving multifunctionality on farmland. We combined methods originating from the natural sciences and the design traditions of landscape architecture to analyse and develop assessments of landscape values with the aim of improving multifunctionality by integrating these values. Finally, we discuss how the design approach of landscape architects can contribute to developing multifunctional farm plans and how the design process results in farm-specific solutions.

AB  - Agriculture is a primary driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, and several expensive schemes have been designed to make modern farming landscapes more hospitable for wildlife. One such market-based mechanisms is the agri-environment-climate schemes (AES) in the European Union (EU). AES compensate farmers for reducing land-use intensity and maintaining or introducing biodiversity-rich habitats. Despite their high costs, impacts of AES vary by measure, region and taxonomic group considered, and have rarely been studied over large areas covering an entire country. Here we assess the country-wide impact of several AES measures on bird abundance using citizen science data on birds and detailed information on AES take up from across Finland. We report a positive impact of organic animal farming on abundance of all farmland associated birds. This effect was particularly strong for insectivorous species, species that are associated to farmyards and long-distance species. None of the other AES measures considered for study did show any relationship with bird abundance. Overall, these findings highlight the potential positive impact that some compensatory measures, such as organic animal farming, may have on wildlife. Traditional animal husbandry is based on grazing of animals and restriction on external inputs, similarly to what is stipulated under organic production contract. As such, traditional animal husbandry may represent an effective landscape management tool for restoring or maintaining threatened species and ecosystems in rural areas of the EU. Ultimately, the apparent lack of a measurable effect of the other AES considered here supports the current move towards evidence-based regional targeting of compensatory measures, so as to concentrate scarce resources to where they can yield the highest ecological benefits.

Impacted communities can exhibit transient dynamics in response to such environmental changes, where slow extinctions and immigration delay the arrival to a new equilibrium. Life history traits such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt, but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs for vascular plants and three insect taxa.
   Location
   South-eastern Sweden.
   Method
   We sampled current species richness of habitat specialist and generalist butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and vascular plants in 45 dry to mesic semi-natural grassland fragments of various size and degree of connectivity, and situated in landscapes with contrasting land use conversion history. Habitat loss was estimated in each landscape by comparing modern maps to ~45year old digitized aerial photographs. An extinction debt can be assumed if historical habitat size and connectivity better explain current species distribution than current habitat variables do.
   Results
   Bees responded rapidly to habitat loss possibly as a result of their primary nesting resource being destroyed. Interestingly, species richness of specialist plants was best explained by historical habitat connectivity, richness of hoverflies by historical habitat area, and richness of butterflies by both historical habitat area and connectivity, indicating extinction debt for these taxa. Habitat generalist butterflies and hoverflies, but not plants and bees, exhibited extinction debt mainly in relation to habitat area. No effect of landscape type was found on the observed extinction debt.
   Main conclusions
   Slow extinctions of persistent and long-lived plants might explain extinction debt for both plants and herbivorous insects linked to these plants.

AB  - The boreal region is facing intensifying resource extraction pressure, but the lack of comprehensive biodiversity data makes operative forest conservation planning difficult. Many countries have implemented forest inventory schemes and are making extensive and up-to-date forest databases increasingly available. Some of the more detailed inventory databases, however, remain proprietary and unavailable for conservation planning. Here, we investigate how well different open and proprietary forest inventory data sets suit the purpose of conservation prioritization in Finland. We also explore how much priorities are affected by using the less accurate but open data. First, we construct a set of indices for forest conservation value based on quantitative information commonly found in forest inventories. These include the maturity of the trees, tree species composition, and site fertility. Secondly, using these data and accounting for connectivity between forest types, we investigate the patterns in conservation priority. For prioritization, we use Zonation, a method and software for spatial conservation prioritization. We then validate the prioritizations by comparing them to known areas of high conservation value. We show that the overall priority patterns are relatively consistent across different data sources and analysis options. However, the coarse data cannot be used to accurately identify the high-priority areas as it misses much of the fine-scale variation in forest structures. We conclude that, while inventory data collected for forestry purposes may be useful for forest conservation purposes, it needs to be detailed enough to be able to account for more fine-scaled features of high conservation value. These results underline the importance of making detailed inventory data publicly available. Finally, we discuss how the prioritization methodology we used could be integrated into operative forest management, especially in countries in the boreal zone.

AB  - The structure and function of many forest ecosystems will be modified as a result of air pollution and climate change. Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests are among the first terrestrial ecosystems to respond to this change. We analysed how changes in climate and environmental factors will affect vegetation cover in Norway spruce forests and whether it is possible to assemble a list of diagnostically important/sensitive species that would be the first to react to changes in habitats of Norway spruce in Central Balkan. Significant changes in the vegetation cover of Norway spruce forests are mainly influenced by temperature increases (approximate to 4 degrees C), and precipitation decreases (approximate to 102 mm) by the end of the 21st century. Projections show that vegetation cover changes and future habitat conditions for Norway spruce forests on podzolic brown soils with a low base saturation and soil pH decreases, and temperature growth and precipitation decline, with the worst in the Rodope montane forest ecoregion. In Dinaric Mountain and Balkan mixed forest ecoregions, the range of natural occurrence of Norway spruce forest will shift to higher altitudes, or to the north. One of the cognitions of this paper is that, through available environmental models and their indices, species from the IUCN Red List should be recognised more properly and included in model calculations.

AB  - Background: Habitat models provide information about which habitat management should target to avoid species extinctions or range contractions. The willow ptarmigan inhabits alpine-and arctic tundra habitats in the northern hemisphere and is listed as near threatened (NT) in the Norwegian red list due to declining population size. Habitat alteration is one of several factors affecting willow ptarmigan populations, but there is a lack of studies quantifying and describing habitat selection in willow ptarmigan. We used data from an extensive line transect survey program from 2014 to 2017 to develop resource selection functions (RSF) for willow ptarmigan in Norway. The selection coefficients for the RSF were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model fitted with random intercepts for each area. We predicted relative probability of selection across Norway and quantile-binned the predictions in 10 RSF bins ranging from low-(1) to high-(10) relative probability of selection.
   Results: Random cross-validation suggest that our models were highly predictive, but validation based spatial blocking revealed that the predictability was better in southern parts of Norway compared to the northernmost region. Willow ptarmigan selected for herb-rich meadows and avoided lichen rich heathlands. There was generally stronger selection for vegetation types with dense field layer and for rich bogs and avoidance of vegetation types with sparse field layer cover and for lowland forest. Further, willow ptarmigan selected for areas around the timberline and for intermediate slopes. Mapping of the RSF showed that 60% of Norway is in the lowest ranked RSF bin and only 2% in the highest ranked RSF bin.
   Conclusions: Willow ptarmigan selected for vegetation types with dense field layer and bogs at intermediate slopes around the timberline. Selection coincides with previous habitat selection studies on willow ptarmigan. This is the first attempt to assess and quantify habitat selection for willow ptarmigan at a large scale using data from line transect distance sampling surveys. Spatial variation in predictability suggests that habitat selection in late summer might vary from north to south. The resource selection map can be a useful tool when planning harvest quotas and habitat interventions in alpine areas.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity requires a wise combination of protection, management and recreation of habitats to secure representative and functional habitat networks. As urbanisation is increasing worldwide. town and cities are becoming the most common habitat for humankind. Accordingly, the urban landscape is becoming increasingly important for maintaining biodiversity on site, as well as for understanding the concept of biodiversity in general, and its maintenance in urban landscapes.
   We evaluated the extent to which Swedish urban planners experience barriers when using comprehensive planning as a tool for the maintenance of biodiversity through the provision of sufficient quantity and quality of green space. All of the six large Swedish cities, having had constant relative population growth since the beginning of the 19th century were chosen as case studies. We first defined a normative model for planning urban biodiversity and operationalised this concept by using landscape ecological principles. Structured in-depth interviews were then carried out with three planners in each city. The respondents were asked about their interest, ability, and knowledge concerning planning for functional networks of green spaces in relation to the normative model.
   The in-depth interviews with 18 urban planners indicated that legislation was an important driver for green space planning that they paid attention to new knowledge concerning recreation values and public health, but that biodiversity maintenance was not a high priority. There was a general agreement that local governments lack necessary resources to plan for biodiversity. A majority of the respondents mentioned geographical information systems (GIS) as an important tool to integrate knowledge about biodiversity in the planning process, and to evaluate likely consequences caused by deviations from current structure plans related to an efficient use of urban green spaces to maintain biodiversity. However, an evaluation of the answers revealed that the respondents had actually overestimated their capacity to implement the normative model. To conclude, the unanimous view was that planners were interested in the maintenance of biodiversity, but were limited by knowledge and by personnel lacking suitable qualifications, as well as by inadequate organisations. Only a minority of the respondents thought that local governments should have resources for biodiversity conservation planning. Finally, we discuss how the implementation of biodiversity policies could be improved by better integration of natural and social sciences in education and policy implementation.

AB  - Prescribed fires are a common nature conservation practice. They are executed by several parties with limited coordination among them, and little consideration for wildfire occurrences and habitat requirements of fire-dependent species. Here, we gathered data on prescribed fires and wildfires in Sweden during 2011-2015 to (i) evaluate the importance and spatial extent of prescribed fires compared to wildfires and (ii) illustrate how a database can be used as a management tool for prescribed fires. We found that on average only 0.006% (prescribed 65%, wildfires 35%) of the Swedish forest burns per year, with 58% of the prescribed fires occurring on clearcuts. Also, both wildfires and prescribed fires seem to be important for the survival of fire-dependent species. A national fire database would simplify coordination and make planning and evaluation of prescribed fires more efficient. We propose an adaptive management strategy to improve the outcome of prescribed fires.

AB  - Maps of forest types in southern Sweden covering the last 2000 years reveal a rapid and widespread transformation from rich, mixed deciduous forest types to species-poor coniferous-dominated forest types. The maps are presented at 500-year intervals and are based on syntheses of fossil pollen data. Fagus sylvatica replaced deciduous mixtures in southerly regions, and during the last 500 years Picea abies became a widespread dominant. We interpret this transformation as being partially a consequence of the climate-driven, continental-scale migrations of Fagus and Picea, but the major controlling factor appears to have been former land-use. This conclusion has significant consequences for 'nature-based' silviculture and conservation of biodiversity. Many threatened species are associated with deciduous forest mixtures, and these forest types have experienced recent. rapid decline. We state that a biologically sustainable silviculture in southern Sweden should be based on a larger range of tree species than at present, thus mimicking natural conditions and providing a greater diversity of product and biological value for the future.

AB  - Deciding which areas to protect, and where to manage and how, are no easy tasks. Many protected areas were established opportunistically under strong political and economic constraints, which may have resulted in inefficient and ineffective conservation. Systematic conservation planning has helped us move from ad-hoc decisions to a quantitative and transparent decision-making process, identifying conservation priorities that achieve explicit objectives in a cost-efficient manner. Here we use Finnish butterflies to illustrate different modeling approaches to address three different types of situations in conservation planning at three different spatial scales. First, we employ species distribution models at the national scale to construct a conservation priority map for 91 species at the resolution of 10x10 km. Species distribution models interpolate sparse occurrence data to infer variation in habitat suitability and to predict species responses to habitat loss, management actions and climate change. Second, at the regional scale we select the optimal management plan to protect a set of habitat specialist species. And third, at the landscape scale, we use a metapopulation approach to manage a network of habitat patches for long-term persistence of a single butterfly species. These different modeling approaches illustrate trade-offs between complexity and tractability and between generality and precision. General correlation-based models are helpful to set priorities for multiple species at large spatial scales. More specific management questions at smaller scales require further data and more complex models. The vast numbers of insect species with diverse ecologies provide a source of information that has remained little used in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - When semi-natural pastures are abandoned, specialized grassland species are lost as a consequence of succession. As a counter-measure, previously abandoned grasslands may be restored by clearing shrubs and trees and re-introducing grazing livestock. In order to examine the effects of this type of habitat restoration, we compared species richness of plants and of specialized plants thought to be dependent on continuous management and species richness and abundance of butterflies and red-listed butterflies in 12 sets of matched continuously managed, abandoned and restored grassland in southern Sweden. We found no differences in species richness or abundance between the three grassland types. There were, however, some negative effects of abandonment. The number of management-dependent plants decreased with increasing cover of trees and shrubs, and in restored sites species richness of all groups decreased with increasing cover of trees and shrubs before restoration. Also the present management significantly affected both butterflies and plants. Species richness of both groups increased with increasing vegetation height and differed between sites depending on the species of grazers, with negative effects of sheep compared to cattle or horses. Our study indicates that for grassland management to be efficient, the restoration actions should mainly be directed towards sites where the post-abandonment succession has not proceeded too far.

AB  - High stumps are often retained at clear cuttings to increase the abundance of habitat patches for saproxylic (wood living) insects. However, these high stumps constitutes a very uniform dead wood habitat which probably supports only a part of the saproxylic fauna. Therefore, we compared the saproxylic fauna of high spruce stumps with the fauna of long and short felled holes of spruce. We also investigated the associations between insect species and polypore fungi growing in the wood. All wood units were created at the same occasion on a clear cut in SW Sweden. The dominating species of bark beetles and longhorn beetles were surveyed in the first year after the cutting. Four years later, the fauna was sampled again by sifting bark samples and all species found were determined. In total we recorded six species early in the succession and 43 four years later. Two species were red-listed. Three out of five statistically tested early successional species had significant associations with some of the wood types, while the corresponding figures later in the succession were six of 15. Three of the 15 species in the late succession were also significantly associated with the presence of fruiting bodies of the polypore fungus Fomitopsis pinicola. We concluded that retaining felled wood in addition to high stumps may provide an important means of diversifying the dead wood substrates, which may in turn increase the number of saproxylic species on a site.

AB  - Management and conservation efforts necessitate the understanding, of species' habitat requirements at the local scale. Population processes. however, often operate at larger scales than a single habitat patch and therefore. attention should be given to species' landscape responses in a network of habitat patches, The aim of this study was to determine important landscape characteristics associated with patch occupancy of the Siberian flying squirrel in northern Finnish forest landscapes, Landscape data were derived from satellite images and analyzed in GIS. Having landscape measures as independent explanatory variables, we developed a predictive landscape model using logistic regression analysis. Our model pointed out the relative importance of landscape characteristics such as the amount and quality of preferred habitat and the degree of structural connectivity at a local scale. Our landscape model was correct in predicting 80% of species occupancy.. We further tested model predictions with an independent data set for another landscape in northern Finland. The model did not predict occupied habitat patches as accurately as unoccupied ones in this test area. suggesting limitations and the need for caution in the application of the model elsewhere in northern Finland. This may be due to inherent landscape patterns and/or population processes that vary amount study areas in the region. This finding suggests that predictive models should he constructed for spatially explicit domains where the changes in, for instance, soil characteristics and topography vary within certain limits and can be controlled. Nevertheless, our model provides a useful tool for landscape ecological forest planning to locate potential habitat patches and assess the quality and spacing of connecting habitat in the matrix.

AB  - We address effects of large-scale forestry on landscape structure and the structure and composition of boreal bird communities in North Sweden. Specifically, we ask: after controlling for the effect of patch size, forest age and tree species composition, is there any residual effect attributable to the reduction in area of old forest? Pairs of landscape blocks (25 by 25 km) were selected to maximize area difference in human-induced disturbance, clear-cut as opposed to semi-natural old forest.
   Median distance to natural edge (wetlands, open water) from randomly selected points in forest was 250 and 200 m in high and low impact landscapes, respectively, indicating a high degree of 'natural' fragmentation of the pristine boreal landscape in the area. By contrast, median distance to clear-cut in uncut forest was 750 and 100 m, respectively. Clear-cuts in high impact landscapes were disproportionally more common in areas with contiguous forest land than in areas with spatially disjunct forest, implicating that forestry increases natural fragmentation of the landscape by subdividing larger forest tracts.
   Point counts along forestry roads showed that species richness and relative abundance of forest birds were higher in landscapes with low forestry impact. These differences can partly be explained by differences in age composition of forest and composition of tree species. After controlling for patch size, forest age and tree species composition, a significant effect of forestry impact remained for Sibirian species and the Tree pipit Anthus trivialis. Our results thus imply that this group of species and the Tree pipit may be sensitive to forest fragmentation.
   In contrast to previous Finnish studies, we found relatively small negative effects on relative abundance of species hypothesized to be negatively affected by large-scale clear-cutting forestry. However, our picture of the present does not contradict results from Finnish long-term population studies. Five factors may account for this: 1) clear-cut areas are not permanently transformed into other land use types, 2) planted forests are not completely inhabitable for species preferring older forest, 3) the majority of species in the regional pool are habitat generalists, 4) the region studied is still extensively covered with semi-natural forest, and 5) our study area is relatively close to contiguous boreal forest in Russia, a potential source area for taiga species.

AB  - The Norwegian landscape is changing as a result of forest regeneration within the cultural landscape, and forest expansion has impacts on accessibility, visibility, and landscape aesthetics, thereby affecting the country's tourism industry. This study aimed at identifying the potential areas of forest regeneration and anticipated subsequent landscape effects on different categories of tourist locations in southern Norway. Deforested areas with a potential for forest regeneration were identified from several map sources by GIS-analyses, and 180 tourist locations were randomly selected from the Norwegian national tourism database (Reiselivsbasen), and then buffered by 2 km radius for land cover classes. The findings revealed that approximately 15% of southern Norway has the climatic potential for future forest regeneration, in addition to 5% of cultivated land. Future forest regeneration will affect the landscapes surrounding the tourist locations of rural south Norway, and while the potential is nationwide, it is not uniformly distributed. Two important tourist landscape regions seem especially exposed to forest regeneration: the coastal heath region and the mountain landscapes. Large parts of these areas do not have sufficient numbers of domestic grazing animals necessary to maintain the present character of the landscape.

AB  - The two most important consequences of modern large-scale forestry for biodiversity are the loss of habitats and the transformation of remaining habitats into homogenous and production intensive systems. In order to counteract these negative effects Fennoscandian forestry has introduced a number of biodiversity-oriented management practices, e.g.. creation of artificial snags, green tree retention. prescribed burning, creation of corridors and buffer strips. Most, if not all, of the new silvicultural methods were introduced based only on scanty scientific evidence. In this paper background to the present situation in Fennoscandian boreal forestry is given in order to introduce papers presented at a Swedish/Finnish workshop on "Science and the Management of Boreal Forest Biodiversity" at Olofsfors. Sweden in September 1999. The Fact that Fennoscandian forestry has practiced large-scale biodiversity management for more than a decade provides us with a unique opportunity to scientifically evaluate the accuracy of these methods. As we progress in scientific understanding modifications in management practices can be made and their outcomes evaluated both in term of biodiversity and timber production.

AB  - Climate change has ubiquitous impacts on ecosystems and threatens biodiversity globally. One of the most recognized impacts are redistributions of species, a process which can be hindered by habitat degradation. Protected areas (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial for preserving and reallocating species occurrences under climate change. Yet, studies investigating effects of PA networks on species' range shifts under climate change remain scarce. In theory, a well-connected network of PAs should promote population persistence under climate change and habitat degradation. To study this, we evaluated the effects of PA coverage on avian communities in Finland between two study periods of 1980-1999 and 2000-2015. Climate-driven community impacts were investigated by using community temperature index (CTI). We used linear models to study the association of PA coverage and the CTI changes in southern, central and northern Finland. In northern and central Finland, higher PA coverage was associated with lower changes in CTI and 45% PA coverage in northern and 13% in central Finland corresponded with complete mitigation of CTI increase. These results indicate that higher PA coverage strongly increases community resilience to warming climate. However a similar association between PA coverage and changes in CTI was not apparent in southern Finland. The PA coverage in southern Finland was much lower than in the two other sections and thus, may be too sparse to favour community resilience against climate change. The results provide empirical evidence for the international need to rapidly expand PA networks and halt biodiversity loss.

AB  - In Sweden, the centre of distribution of the nationally red-listed Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio has shifted from farmland landscapes to forest landscapes from the 1960s until today. In this study, reproductive performance of Red-backed Shrikes breeding in grasslands in a 75-km(2) farmland landscape and clear-cuts in a 75-km(2) forest landscape was compared during 1994-1995. During 2003, order of settlement and reproductive performance as well as food abundance and nest predator abundance were assessed in a 3-km(2) area in each landscape type. The average number of fledglings was significantly higher in clear-cuts than in grasslands. Furthermore, post-fledgling survival and the probability of replacement clutches following nest failure were likely to be higher in clear-cuts than in grasslands due to the significantly earlier arrival date to clear-cuts. These differences are likely explained by a lower nest predation in clear-cuts compared to grasslands. Today, forest clear-cuts represent the primary habitat of the Red-backed Shrike in Sweden, and probably also elsewhere in the boreal parts of northern Europe.

AB  - Establishment of plans for environmental planning and management requires that a number of natural and societal factors must be taken into consideration. Insights into the inherent dynamics of nature as well as the role that past human activities have played for establishing the current condition of the landscape and the natural environment in general are essential. Many natural and man-made changes occur over time scales of decades or centuries, and these are difficult to comprehend without a historical perspective. Such a perspective can be obtained using palaeoecological studies, i.e. by geochemical and biological analyses of lake sediment and peat deposits. To illustrate the long-term dynamics of nature and particularly the role of man, we present here five case studies from Sweden concerning pollution, lake acidification, lake eutrophication, biodiversity, and landscape dynamics and conservation - topics of broad interests - and discuss benefits of including a longer time perspective in environmental management.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation resulting from anthropogenic land-use change may negatively affect both biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. However, susceptibility to fragmentation varies between species and may be influenced by for instance specialization, functional traits and trophic level. We examined how total and specialist species richness, species composition and functional trait composition at two trophic levels (vascular plants and sap-feeding hoppers) vary with habitat fragmentation (patch size and connectivity) in dry calcareous grasslands in southeast Norway. We found that fragmentation affected plant and hopper species composition both totally and of habitat specialists, but with a net species loss only for the specialists, indicating greater susceptibility of specialized species. Reductions in patch size and increasing isolation negatively affected plant specialists with different sets of traits, effectively reducing the number of species with trait combinations suitable to persist in small and isolated patches. Fragmentation influenced trait composition of the total hopper community, but not of habitat specialists. A lesser degree of habitat association could explain why hoppers, despite belonging to a higher tropic level, seemed to be less susceptible to fragmentation than plants. Nonetheless, our study shows that habitat fragmentation affects both species richness, species composition and trait composition of plants and hoppers, indicating that fragmentation leads not only to a loss of species, but also alters dominance hierarchies and the functionality of grassland communities.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - The new Swedish Forestry Act states that the forests should be sustainably managed in a profitable way and, at the same time, the current levels of biodiversity should be maintained. This and the pressure from consumers for forest products to be produced in a way which protects biodiversity has changed forestry towards a more nature oriented management. An estimation of the effects of this nature conservation on timber yields and potential cut must be included in forest scenario modelling to assess the long-term impacts.
   An important component of preserving biodiversity in forests in this nature oriented management is to adjust management measures in edge zones adjacent to mires, riparian zones, non-productive hills, etc. Examples of management measures in edge zones are no cutting, modified thinning, single tree selection or leaving behind large trees. These spatial considerations can now be dealt with in long-term forecasts using HUGIN, a system based on sample plot data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). This is because of the improved description of the context of the NFI sample plots in the landscape. Furthermore, geographical positions are determined using the Global Positioning System (GPS), which facilitates the combination of NFI data with other data sources.
   A schedule of how to select sample plots located in forest habitats that are valuable for biodiversity is shown.
   Analyses of the new NFI data show that approximately ii % of the productive forest land is located within 25 meters of mires and non-productive hills and 3 % is located in riparian zones. Forest scenario modelling using the HUGIN system will now be able to estimate the reductions in the long-term potential cut due to nature conservation in edge zones.

AB  - Drawing on examples from the Nordic countries, this article aims to explore the practical application of strategic policy and planning instruments and approaches that facilitate the integration of land use and transport planning and promote sustainable policy measures through collaboration among stakeholders across various governance levels. This research applies a qualitative research design including literature research, interviews, and workshops involving practitioners from the five Nordic countries. In this paper, we present an overview of the planning structure in the Nordic countries, including institutions that govern land use and transport planning. We identify different approaches to bridge the gap between land use and transport planning, such as the Finger Plan in Denmark, MAL in Finland, Concept Studies in Norway, and Strategic Choice of Measures in Sweden. Many of the examples employ informal collaborative approaches among authorities to form a shared vision and seek consensus on a combination of policy measures and actions. The paper examines collaborative approaches in relation to regulatory planning and discusses the role of these processes in advancing integrated land use and transport planning and fostering sustainable urban development.

AB  - Successful biodiversity conservation requires safeguarding viable populations of species. To work with this challenge Sweden has introduced a concept of Action Plans, which focus on the recovery of one or more species; while keeping in mind the philosophy of addressing ecosystems in a more comprehensive way, following the umbrella concept. In this paper we investigate the implementation process of the Action Plan for one umbrella species, the White-backed Woodpecker (WBW) Dendrocopos leucotos. We describe the plan's organisation and goals, and investigate its implementation and accomplishment of particular targets, based on interviewing and surveying the key actors. The achievement of the targets in 2005-2008 was on average much lower than planned, explained partially by the lack of knowledge/data, experienced workers, and administrative flexibility. Surprisingly, the perceived importance of particular conservation measures, the investment priority accorded to them, the money available and various practical obstacles all failed to explain the target levels achieved. However qualitative data from both the interviews and the survey highlight possible implementation obstacles: competing interests with other conservation actions and the level of engagement of particular implementing actors. Therefore we suggest that for successful implementation of recovery plans, there is a need for initial and inclusive scoping prior to embarking on the plan, where not only issues like ecological knowledge and practical resources are considered, but also possible conflicts and synergies with other conservation actions. An adaptive approach with regular review of the conservation process is essential, particularly in the case of such complex action plans as the one for the WBW.

AB  - Saproxylic beetles represent an important part of the chain of decay processes and are of high interest for understanding the main drivers of forest community succession.
   The main aims of this paper were to determine (i) the differences between communities of the crown and stem strata and (ii) the effect of fine vertical stratification within the studied strata on adult saproxylic beetle activity and the success of larval development.
   The study was performed over three years in mature oak-dominated managed forests in Poland. The activity and development of the beetles was evaluated based on sampling from 60 traps and 60 logs, respectively.
   In total, 11,237 individuals representing 364 species of saproxylic beetles were trapped and 388 individuals representing 38 species were reared. Compared with most previous studies, our results indicated that the majority of dependent variables (the species richness and abundance of saproxylic beetles and their functional groups, sub-guilds, and conservation-related and functional traits) revealed a significant preference for the crown, specifically the lower part. For example, predators searched for the transition zone between the crown and stem, which has a high prey density. The preferences of guild specialists and threatened species indicated that micro-habitats (e.g., hollows or fungi) are more frequent in the crown stratum than in the stem in managed forests, and the higher biomass of saproxylic beetles likely reflects the amount of energy produced in lower parts of crowns.
   Compared with that observed in previous studies, the opposite pattern of preference for crowns was likely related to the higher anthropogenic pressure in managed forests, which is an important insight that can inform the future management (e.g., biocontrol by natural enemies or conservation) of these forest types.

AB  - Here we present a framework for identifying areas with high dead wood potential (DWP) for conservation planning needs. The amount and quality of dead wood and dying trees are some of the most important factors for biodiversity in forests. As they are easy to recognize on site, it is widely used as a surrogate marker for ecological quality of forests. However, wall-to-wall information on dead wood is rarely available on a large scale as field data collection is expensive and local dead wood conditions change rapidly. Our method is based on the forest growth models in the Motti forest simulator, taking into account 168 combinations of tree species, site types, and vegetation zones as well as recommendations on forest management. Simulated estimates of stand-level dead wood volume and mean diameter at breast height were converted into DWP functions. The accuracy of the method was validated on two sites in southern and northeastern Finland, both consisting of managed and conserved boreal forests. Altogether, 203 field plots were measured for living and dead trees. Data on living trees were inserted into corresponding DWP functions and the resulting DWPs were compared to the measured dead wood volumes. Our results show that DWP modeling is an operable tool, yet the accuracy differs between areas. The DWP performs best in near-pristine southern forests known for their exceptionally good quality areas. In northeastern areas with a history of softer management, the differences between near-pristine and managed forests is not as clear. While accurate wall-to-wall dead wood inventory is not available, we recommend using DWP method together with other spatial datasets when assessing biodiversity values of forests.

AB  - We investigate processes through which organizations engaged in natural resource management pursue conservation innovations-that is, create capabilities that allow them to produce new goods and services or produce goods and services in ways that reduce environmental degradation. Through an accounting of organizational competencies, we conduct an exploratory analysis of investments Finnish forest management service providers-public agencies, private firms, and civil society actors have made to address demand for biodiversity conservation. From the perspective of theory and method, our pilot study points to opportunities to test, and perhaps advance, hypothesized tendencies toward environmental improvement through assessment of material practices and organizational strategies. This materialist approach is applicable to analysis at the level of organizations, sectors and territories. From an empirical perspective, the research highlights the contemporary coevolution of incentives and patterns of organizational behavior in Finnish forestry in response to social demand for biodiversity conservation and multifunctional landscapes.

AB  - Mountain areas are often subject to conflicts between different user interests and protection. The authors examine land use planning processes in Norway applied in accordance with the Planning and Building Act and the Nature Diversity Act and discuss how they might be improved. They find that although influenced by trends of decentralization, inclusion and integration, and principles for multilevel governance, the land use planning approaches for use and protection are still performed in the shadow of instrumentalism and hierarchy with little awareness of their limitations in practical use. The "communicative turn" has stimulated comprehensive participation processes, but these consensus-oriented processes have to some extent been able to handle conflicting interests. The authors conclude that in future planning it will be vital to establish common arenas as trading zones for coordinated municipal, regional and national planning, combining instrumental and communicative practices with agonistic approaches in a multilevel governance network.

AB  - Litter pollution is a global environmental problem that occurs in virtually all ecosystems. Scientific research on anthropogenic litter and its environmental impacts focusses predominantly on plastics and the marine environment. Little empirical knowledge exists about the distribution and ecological impacts of litter in terrestrial environments, where most litter is produced. To start closing that knowledge gap, we investigated the distribution of litter in a cultural landscape in central Norway and in relation to land cover types. We registered and collected litter in 110 survey plots that were randomly stratified across various land cover types. Our results show that land cover type modulates the occurrence, abundance, fragments size, and that litter is most present and abundant in or near land cover types associated with high human activities. Plastic was by far the most common litter material type, although the litter community (in terms of materials type) was not independent from land cover type. This knowledge can help to inform and optimize litter management and clean-up activities in terrestrial landscapes. How and to what extent the spatial structure of the litter community mediates ecological effects across various land cover types remains unknown to a large extent and warrants further study.

AB  - The saproxylic beetle fauna on old oaks was sampled in four regions of southern Sweden using two methods: window and pitfall trapping. The aim was to test a way of finding indicator species which can be used to identify sites with high species number or that scored high on a conservation priority species index, based on occurrence of red-listed species. From 92 sites surveyed, in total 164 species of saproxylic beetles were identified. Different sets of indicator species were selected based upon 22 sites from a centrally located region. Predictions of species number and the index for 30 other sites from the same province were made. The correlation between observed and predicted species number and the index increased with increasing number of indicators. When comparing different treatment of species indata, the explanatory power of predictions was strongest for presence/absence data. Indicator sets of species effectively caught with pitfall traps gave overall the best predictions of both species number and the index. Predictions of species number and the index worked well within the same regions but gave varied result for the three other regions which shows that transferability of indicators between regions may be doubtful.

AB  - In Sweden, an estimated 0.3-0.6 million hectares (1.2-2.4% of the entire Swedish forest area) of forests are voluntary set-asides for nature conservation management (NCM). Even though these areas are crucial in Swedish biodiversity conservation, no analysis has yet been carried out of their conservation values and spatial distribution. The aim of this study was to comprehensively describe areas intended for NCM in Sweden. Based on existing habitat descriptions, six NCM area categories were defined. The occurrence of each category was determined through GIS analysis of a spatially explicit dataset containing information on 26,953 stands (136,672 ha) set aside for NCM. Of the analysed area, 86% met the criteria of at least one category. The most common category was Old coniferous forests, which was found to be abundant in northern Sweden, and often the only category met in stands. Out of the remaining five categories, four were more frequent in southern Sweden. In the southern regions, stands often met the criteria of two or three categories simultaneously. This mapping is a resource for further research and development of policies and strategies aimed at increasing the extent and improving the quality of nature conservation management.

AB  - Sustainable transformation is hampered by conflicting goals. Here we examine how goal conflicts are handled in planning practice, focusing on processes around municipal climate and sustainability governance. We investigate local manifestations of goal conflicts between transport and land use planning and emissions reductions in three Norwegian cities, using document analysis, interviews and observation. We find that governance actors handle goal conflicts through what we term strategies of displacement. We identify three such strategies: temporal, sectorial and scalar. The research contributes to explaining how and why goal conflicts persist in planning practice.

AB  - Based on literature and six country studies (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Slovakia) this paper discusses the compatibility of the EU 2020 targets for renewable energy with conservation of biodiversity.
   We conclude that increased demand for biomass for bioenergy purposes may lead to a continued conversion of valuable habitats into productive lands and to intensification, which both have negative effects on biodiversity. On the other hand, increased demand for biomass also provides opportunities for biodiversity, both within existing productive lands and in abandoned or degraded lands. Perennial crops may lead to increased diversity in crop patterns, lower input uses, and higher landscape structural diversity which may all have positive effects on biodiversity.
   In production forest opportunities exist to harvest primary wood residues. Removal of these forest residues under strict sustainability conditions may become economically attractive with increased biomass demand.
   An additional biomass potential is represented by recreation areas, road-side verges, semi-natural and natural areas and lands which have no other use because they have been abandoned, polluted or degraded.
   Whether effects of cropping of biomass and/or removal of biomass has positive or negative impact on biodiversity depends strongly on specific regional circumstances, the type of land and land use shifts involved and the associated management practices in general. However, it is clear that in the six countries studied certain types of biomass crops are likely to be more sustainable than others. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - European and global urbanisation is increasing. For the urban population, the woodlands in the urban and peri-urban landscape are important as places for recreation and contact with nature among other functions. This paper presents a geographical information system (GIS) based model to classify urban woodlands by urban pressure, of which visitor pressure is a key component. The model identifies and uses distance, accessibility and quality of woodland as key components affecting visitation rates for urban woodland. The model was applied to the Malmo-Lund region in Sweden, a highly urbanised area with few areas accessible for recreation. Validation of the model was through field inventory of indicators of urban pressure. The classification identifies woodlands with a high priority for including visitor pressure in management planning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study describes forest landscape fragmentation and connectivity along the Finnish-Russian border near the Karelian Isthmus. The landscape pattern was analysed using classification data based on Landsat ETM+ and Landsat TM images in combination with systematic surveys in Finland (Finnish National Forest Inventory) (n=546) and the authors' own fieldwork data in Russia (n=101). On the Finnish side the forest patches are significantly smaller than on the Russian side. In addition, the Finnish forests landscape is more scattered and distances between patches of the same forest type are longer. The Russian side is more dominated by broadleaved and mixed forest stands. The disparities are due to differences in forestry policy and traditions of forest practices. The growing conditions of the areas are similar. The habitat fragmentation and habitat connectivity are important issues because the Karelian Isthmus is one of three main corridors and migrating routes connecting large Russian boreal taiga forests and their fauna and flora with Finnish isolated boreal forests.

AB  - Finland, Norway and Sweden have in total about 126500 lakes larger than four hectares. In Finland and Sweden, approximately 10% of the surface area is freshwater; whereas in Norway, it is about 6%. Altogether 56 fish species are reproducing in the Nordic freshwaters, including four lamprey species. Due to geographical differences, the freshwater fish fauna differs considerably in the northern and southern parts; but species richness increases also from west to east. The proportion of recreational fishermen in Norway, Finland and Sweden was about 50%, 40% and 27 %, respectively, in 2004. Professional freshwater fishing is declining, but is still important in some lakes in Finland and Sweden. In all three countries, fishing rights belong to the water or land owner, with some exceptions.
   Water quality has improved in recent decades due to decreased nutrient loads from point sources, but the limitation of scattered nutrient loads has been less successful. This development can also be seen in the responses of fish communities. Some 30-40 years ago, waters close to many cities or industrial plants were heavily polluted and had only limited recreational or fisheries value. Recently, they are often inhabited by healthy fish populations. On the other hand, there are many highly eutrophic lakes in agricultural areas of southern and western Finland and Sweden that regularly suffer from algal blooms and high biomasses of cyprinid fish. The increasing acidification problem of oligotrophic lakes was related to long distance air pollution in recent years, but the situation has now improved. Lake regulation impacts the littoral ecosystems in hundreds of lakes and causes considerable negative impacts on feeding and reproduction areas for fish. The main measure used for compensating the damaged fish numbers has been stocking. Many large rivers have been modified for hydropower production. Most activities of fish habitat restoration are directed at rivers. Fisheries management includes several tools: regulations on use and structure of fishing gear, temporal and regional fishing restrictions, the size limits of target fish, the limitations of fishing efficiency, and amount of catch. The general goal is to meet the principles of sustainable use of natural resources.

AB  - With continuous degradation of ecosystems combined with the recognition of human dependence on functioning ecosystems, global interest in ecological restoration (ER) has intensified. From being merely a nature conservation measure, it is today advanced as a way to improve ecosystem functions, mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, as well as renew human-nature relationships. However, ER is a contested and diversified term used in research, policy and practice. Substantive public funding is allocated towards this end worldwide, but little is known about its concrete purpose and coverage, as well as what decides its allocation. With inspiration from environmental funding literature we analyze the case of Sweden to provide the first national overview of public ER funding. The understudied political context of ER is thus addressed but also regional variation in funding allocation. A database of all national government funding programs between 1995 and 2011 that included projects and sub-programs aiming at practical ER measures was created. Results show that ER activities counted for 11% (130 million USD) of the total government nature conservation funding. Water environments were highly prioritized, which can be explained by economic and recreational motives behind ER. The ER funding was unevenly distributed geographically, not related to either environmental need or population size, but rather to regional administrative capacity. It was also found to be small scale and short term, and hence part of a general trend of "project proliferation" of public administration which runs contrary to ecosystem based management. As ER is not yet a long-term investment in Sweden, commonly seen as an environmental lead state, we expect even less and more short-term ER funding in other countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban woodland management usually requires trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and promotion of recreational values. Preference studies have shown that people in general prefer semi-open forests with little undergrowth rather than unmanaged forests with dense understory and an abundance of dead wood. In this study the visitor employed photography (VEP) method was used to evaluate visitors' perceptions of an urban forest. Volunteers were given cameras and asked to take pictures of the places that they liked and disliked the most along a trail with varied forest vegetation in a near-urban recreational area in Gothenburg, Sweden. The survey was conducted on two occasions, in April and September. Photo content in combination with the participants' comments in their photo-logs was analysed with particular focus on features related to understory density, dead wood and visible human impact. The analyses of photo content suggested that the main differences in the participants' preferences were between natural and human-made objects or landscapes. Pictures of natural objects were mostly classified as "liked", while "disliked" was dominant among the pictures of human impact. Future VEP studies in urban woodlands should preferably include participants with a wider span in age and background than in the present study. The photo and analysis procedure could be changed, depending on local key-issues regarding management or conservation planning. This study has shown that the visitor employed photography method can be used as a quantitative method to evaluate perceptions about forest vegetation and management in urban woodlands, and could serve as a valuable complement to conventional methods in preference research.

AB  - Sediment size and supply exert a dominant control on channel structure. We review the role of sediment supply in channel structure, and how regional differences in sediment supply and land use affect stream restoration priorities. We show how stream restoration goals are best understood within a common fluvial geomorphology framework defined by sediment supply, storage, and transport. Land-use impacts in geologically young landscapes with high sediment yields (e.g., coastal British Columbia) typically result in loss of in-stream wood and accelerated sediment inputs from bank erosion, logging roads, hillslopes and gullies. In contrast, northern Sweden and Finland are landscapes with naturally low sediment yields caused by low relief, resistant bedrock, and abundant mainstem lakes that act as sediment traps. Land-use impacts involved extensive channel narrowing, removal of obstructions, and bank armouring with boulders to facilitate timber floating, thereby reducing sediment supply from bank erosion while increasing export through higher channel velocities. These contrasting land-use impacts have pushed stream channels in opposite directions (aggradation versus degradation) within a phase-space defined by sediment transport and supply. Restoration in coastal British Columbia has focused on reducing sediment supply (through bank and hillslope stabilization) and restoring wood inputs. In contrast, restoration in northern Fennoscandia (Sweden and Finland) has focused on channel widening and removal of bank-armouring boulders to increase sediment supply and retention. These contrasting restoration priorities illustrate the consequences of divergent regional land-use impacts on sediment supply, and the utility of planning restoration activities within a mechanistic sediment supply-transport framework.

AB  - Red algae are an important component of the Baltic Sea rocky shores. Within the Finnish marine area, in the northern Baltic Sea, red algal communities (on habitat level) are currently listed as endangered, due to eutrophication effects and potential future decrease in salinity. At species level, Rhodomela confervoides and Ceramium virgatum are red-listed. Despite their common use in different management contexts within the Baltic Sea, e.g. their depth distribution used as an indicator of the status of the sea areas, we know little about the commonness and more detailed distribution patterns of the red algal species. This limits the reliability of algae-based assessments. The aim of this study was to describe the general occurrence patterns, abundance and prevalence of erect perennial and annual red algae, based on extensive scuba-diving inventories within the Finnish marine area. Furthermore, the most representative areas for the red algal communities were identified. The results show high variation in depth distribution and prevalence across environmental gradients for many red algal species, e. g. for the relatively common perennial species Furcellaria lumbricalis and Vertebrata fucoides. In comparison to older data, reductions in depth penetration and occurrence were identified especially for deep-occurring species such as Rhodomela confervoides. With improved knowledge on the occurrence patterns of red algal species in relation to environmental variation, our results enable more reliable use of red algae as indicators of the status of the sea areas. By identifying areas where red algal communities are currently most representative, the results also allow better targeting of management efforts aiming to improve their status, such as areal protection measures or reducing nutrient input from point sources.

KW  - URBAN
AB  - The landscape of many historic cities and the character of their shallow subsurface environments are defined by a legacy of interaction between anthropogenic and geological processes. Anthropogenic deposits and excavations result from processes ranging from archaeological activities to modern urban development. Hence, in heritage cities, any geological investigation should acknowledge the role of past and ongoing human activities, while any archaeological investigation should be conducted with geological processes in mind. In this paper it is shown that 3D geological and anthropogenic models at different scales can provide a holistic system for the management of the subsurface. It provides a framework for the integration of other spatial and process models to help assess the preservation potential for buried heritage. Such an integrated framework model is thus contributing to a decision support system for sustainable urban (re)development and regeneration in cities, while preserving cultural heritage. A collaborative approach is proposed to enhance research and implementation of combined geological and archaeological modelling for sustainable land use planning and heritage preservation, using York and Bryggen as prime examples. This paper presents the status of 3D framework modelling at Bryggen in Norway as an example. (C) Natural Environment Research Council. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

AB  - In autumn 2002, the Finnish government approved a proposal put forward by a broad-based committee for a programme of measures to safeguard forest biodiversity in southern Finland, western Oulu province and southwest Lapland. The programme has been given the name Metso. Pentti Lahteenoja, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, sees the programme as an excellent example of Finland's ability to coordinate joint action in matters as sensitive as conservation (article on pages 366-368). New non-compulsory conservation measures are being tested as part of the programme.
   A scheme has been introduced for compensating forest owners either for leaving their forest untouched to preserve its natural values or for carrying out agreed felling or forest management work. The first agreements under the scheme were made in September 2003.
   The environment authorities invite forest owners to offer sites for conservation together with the price they would accept in return. "The idea is to get the programme moving by designating for longer-term conservation areas that meet certain criteria. The State may acquire such sites, or they can be designated as privately owned nature conservation areas on either a permanent or a long-term basis", says Lahteenoja.
   The new voluntary forest conservation initiative is implemented in what are referred to as management areas established at the landowner's request and where conservation and forestry are practised in harmony with each other. This allows forestry work to be carried out more extensively than at present in forest immediately adjacent to sites of conservation importance.

AB  - Protected Landscapes (PLs) are increasingly used in Norway to conserve cultural (human modified) landscapes. In many cases the maintenance of agricultural activities in PLs is required to preserve landscape character. Whilst research exists on land conservation policies in general, the particular effects of PL on management and adjustment of the farms involved have not received attention in the literature. We present results from a questionnaire sent to owners of agricultural land within PLs in Norway. Whilst landowners were divided upon the effects of PLs on farm management, the economic situation of the farm was little affected. Furthermore, changes in farm management after the establishment of a PL did not seem to have been driven by the establishment of the PLs per se. Most importantly, farm management changes were related to potential options to develop the farm and its land. A statistical model showed that PL-farms did not differ significantly from farms outside PL in the development of their land use or animal husbandry. Our findings thus indicate that the establishment of PL played a minor role as a driving force of changes in farm management and farm income. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the contribution of the Norwegian integrated marine management (IMM) plans to marine environmental protection and conservation. These plans have been described as international best practice, and the government's goal is 'for Norway to be a pioneer in developing an integrated ecosystem-based management regime for marine areas'. The plans pursue other objectives, including sustainable use and value creation, but this article focuses on their contribution to environmental objectives. By means of a problem analysis, the article outlines three approaches to 'marine environmental protection and conservation' that contribute thereto in profoundly different ways. The contribution of the IMM plans to each of these approaches is examined, leading to the conclusion that two are embedded in the plans, which therefore primarily contribute to some reduced harm, as opposed to contributing to long-term marine environmental protection. This suggests that integrated marine plans and policies are relevant for more restricted environmental objectives.

AB  - The red-listed, amphi-Atlantic sedge Carex rufina is highly specialized to certain alpine snowbeds, and threatened by current changes in snow cover duration and moisture conditions. Here we address its range-wide genetic diversity, history, and conservation using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Despite extensive primer testing, we detected very low overall diversity (4.1% polymorphic markers). Only a single AFLP phenotype was found throughout Norway and across the Atlantic to Iceland and Greenland, while another was found in Canada, suggesting glacial survival in one East and one West Atlantic refugium. East Atlantic C. rufina has probably been heavily bottlenecked in a small refugium, possibly situated within the maximum limits of the ice sheets. Its lack of diversity is likely maintained through local clonal growth causing longevity of genotypes. Habitat availability appears as the main limiting factor for C. rufina, and its currently occupied habitats need to be preserved to ensure its long-time survival.

AB  - Background Biodiversity crisis requires researchers to reflect on tools and strategies to engage with different stakeholders. We propose that serious games can be designed to introduce stakeholders to a novel environmental policy tool and to communicate research on environmental issues. Our case is biodiversity offsetting (BDO), a novel policy tool aiming to reconcile nature conservation with other land uses. As any media, games offer certain framings of the issues they communicate about-some aspects are made more salient than others. However, frame analysis has not been widely used to analyze the design choices or the messages communicated by games. We analyze how these framings are designed into a game communicating about environmental issues. Aim To intervene in the emerging public discussion on BDO in Finland, we designed a land use board game and during the design process, played it with public and private stakeholders who would soon encounter and implement biodiversity offsetting policies in Finland. The aim of this article is to describe how our framings of BDO affected the design process and how those framings interacted with the design decisions we made. With our analysis, we want to contribute to the understanding of how framings and design choices interact in game design and how paying attention to framings is especially important for the design of SGs. Method We analyze how our framings of biodiversity offsetting and our design choices interact in game design. Our understanding of biodiversity offsetting guided our game design, but the design choices also contribute to the framing of the issue itself. Results Game design choices strongly frame the topic of the game and thus influence the function of a serious game. Thus, the framings of the topic should be considered carefully during the game design process, especially in the context of serious games.

AB  - One of the main problems that public institutions face in the management of protected areas, such as the European Natura 2000 network, is determining how to design and implement sustainable management plans that account for the wide range of marketed and non-marketed benefits they provide to society. This paper presents an application of a stated preference valuation approach aimed at evaluating the social preferences of the population of the Basque Country, Spain, for the key attributes of a regional Natura 2000 network site. According to our results, individuals' willingness-to-pay (WTP) is higher for attributes associated with non-use values (native tree species and biodiversity conservation) than for attributes associated with use values (agricultural development and commercial forestry). The paper concludes that management policies related to Natura 2000 network sites should account for both for the importance of non-use values and the heterogeneity of the population's preferences in order to minimize potential land use conflicts.

AB  - Many beetles associated with old trees are on national red lists, but pseudoscorpions living in similar habitats have received little attention. This study reports the habitat and occurrence patterns of two species of pseudoscorpions living in hollow trees. Their occurrence has been assessed by sieving wood mould from 274 oaks in southeastern Sweden and from museum specimens collected in Sweden. Larca lata is confined to hollow oaks with a large girth and a plentiful supply of wood mould. Allochernes wideri is much less particular about wood mould volume, trunk diameter and tree species. Larca lata inhabits hollow trunks with characteristics that are typical of very old trees, whereas A. wideri predominantly occurs in trunks in an earlier stage of hollow formation. Larca lata was almost exclusively found in larger assemblages of hollow oaks, which suggests long-term survival may be difficult when the network of suitable hollow trees is too sparse. Larca lata is a rare species in Europe and probably vulnerable to extinction, since it is dependent on a habitat which has declined severely in the last few centuries.

AB  - Bottom-up control is an important regulator of marine mesopredators such as seabirds. The prevalence of top-down control on these species is however less well understood. In particular, how native predators affect seabird populations has rarely been quantified. Here, we investigate how an increase in white-tailed eagles in northern Norway, a stronghold for the species, affected a local population of 25,000 pairs of black-legged kittiwakes, a red-listed seabird, during a 42-year period ending with colony extinction. We use a natural experiment of two neighbouring colonies with/without eagle predation to disentangle the effects of eagles from local kittiwake foraging conditions (using size of young herring as a proxy). At the colony where eagle predation occurred, and in contrast to the eagle-free colony, kittiwake breeding success and population size declined with increased eagle abundance, the latter more strongly under poor foraging conditions. Breeding success increased with improving foraging conditions at both colonies. Simple population modelling shows that although conditions were insufficient to sustain the eagle-exposed colony, the increased abundance of eagles sped up its extirpation by many years. Policy implications. Our study shows that top-down effects from avian predators can be significant regulators of seabird populations, challenging their conservation where native, often protected, predators are rising. Such effects, and their possible interaction with other factors, must also be accounted for when using seabird demographic traits as environmental indicators and when developing more flexible and effective management and action plans.

AB  - To implement policies on sustainable forest management (SFM), there is a need to satisfy economical, ecological and socio-cultural sustainability objectives. Due to a long history of sustained yield wood production to satisfy the needs of the forest industry, clearfelling management systems are used in similar to 96 per cent of managed forests in Sweden. To satisfy the intentions of contemporary forest and land use policies, uneven-aged forest management systems as a complement are currently debated. We interviewed local forestry stakeholders in the Swedish boreal forest region's north and south about their views on and attitudes towards different forest management systems' contribution to SFM. Most stakeholders were generally negative to the use of uneven-aged system for sustained yield wood production but saw advantages for ecological and socio-cultural dimensions of SFM. To encourage the use of even-aged cohort and uneven-aged systems to satisfy all dimensions of SFM, there is a need for improved communication, education and public awareness. This could ultimately lead to a more constructive and less heated debate. In addition, there is a need of more empirically based knowledge about uneven-aged and cohort forest management systems' pros and cons when it comes to satisfying economical, ecological and socio-cultural objectives.

AB  - Until its replacement by high forest systems in the 19th centuries, coppicing had been practiced in the deciduous broad-leaved forests of Central Europe for many centuries, serving as a source of fuel wood, charcoal and tan-bark for the local populations. Nowadays, some coppice-with-standards (CWS) stands have been converted to high forest by singling (sprout thinning), but many others were simply abandoned, resulting in CWS stands with an overmature coppice component. Little knowledge exists on the biodiversity hosted by such abandoned CWS.
   In this study, we compared stand features and saproxylic beetle biodiversity in CWS stands with a mature (20-year-old) coppice component to those in stands with an overmature (60-year-old) coppice component. For our study area, we selected 29 plots in 12 oak-hornbeam forests in five regions in northern France.
   We show that extending rotation age increases the amount of woody debris and alters the deadwood profile. The older the trees and the stands, the more coarse woody debris was created; this includes debris resulting from natural disturbance events. We demonstrated that overmature CWS stands have a higher saproxylic beetle richness than mature CWS. Moreover, even though we found few red-listed beetle species, their number tended to increase in the overmature CWS stands. These results are in line with the observed shift in deadwood profile. Indeed, the increase in deadwood volume along the maturity gradient seems to positively affect saproxylic beetle diversity. Consequently, we conclude that conserving CWS stands with an overmature coppice component can be a useful tool in biodiversity restoration management, in addition to set aside areas.

AB  - . The Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) is included among the strictly protected species of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EC) of the European Union, which is one of the key instruments for biodiversity preservation in Europe. Strict protection of the species has a potential to cause conflicts in areas where forest management and urban development compete for the same space with the flying squirrel. This study examined attitudes of Finnish citizens toward the protection of flying squirrels in urban areas using survey data collected in three cities: Espoo, Jyvaskyla, and Kuopio. Two samples (random and self-selection samples) were collected to investigate how the specific process of giving "voice" to citizens by polls in urban planning affects the results. The analysis was conducted by integrating factor and cluster analysis and multinomial logistic regression modeling. Four attitude groups of citizens were identified and named: "neutral on protection" (share of respondents: 33%), "strongly in favor of protection" (32%), "somewhat against protection" (26%), and "strongly against protection" (9%). Several individual-specific factors were found to be associated with the probability of belonging to different attitude groups. For example, female respondents had a higher probability of belonging to the group that was strongly in favor of protection, and older respondents had a higher probability of belonging to groups against protection. Respondents of the self-selection sample had a higher probability of belonging to the "strongly in favor of protection" group. They therefore had a more positive attitude toward the protection of flying squirrels than the other respondents. This finding indicates that cities may gain an overly positive view of citizens' attitudes toward the protection of flying squirrels through current public participation methods based on self-selection procedures, such as public hearings used in land use planning.

AB  - Urban development projects may cause loss of amenity values of green areas, which should be taken into consideration in planning. Therefore, quantitative information on residents' valuation concerning urban forests is needed for assessing urban land use. The purpose of this investigation was to study the valuation of urban forests in two different urban environments Joensuu and Sale, Finland. The aims were to study the attitudes towards and benefits related to the use of urban forests and, in particular, to measure the valuations in monetary terms using contingent valuation, i.e. measure the residents' willingness-to-pay for larger wooded recreation areas and for small forested parks.
   Urban forests were seen in both towns as clearly producing positive benefits rather than causing negative effects. The negative features of forests were related to the management of the areas rather than their existence. The main values were related to nature and social functions of forests. In contrast, timber production achieved a distinctively low priority in both study towns. The results stress the importance of defining urban forest policies for municipalities in Finland.
   More than two-thirds of the respondents were willing to pay for the use of recreation areas. Good location and active management raised the average WTP. Moreover, approximately half of the respondents were willing to pay for preventing construction in urban forests. The results also show that the monetary value of amenity benefits in recreation areas is much higher than the present maintenance costs. The examples concerning the advantageousness of construction on green areas suggest that a limit could be found where the infill of housing areas is not worthwhile from the point of view of society, if the losses of green space benefits are taken into account.

AB  - In a context of growing socio-spatial polarization and of restructuring state-market relations in urban governance, a new phenomenon is emerging in Swedish cities, that is, partnerships for urban regeneration inspired by the Business Improvement District (BID) model. Through an empirical case study research on one of the most long-standing BID partnerships in Sweden - that is, BID Gamlestaden in Gothenburg - the article critically assesses whether the BID model as it has been applied in Sweden represents a socially and politically sustainable tool for urban regeneration. Namely, the study analyses the complex constellation of power entrenched in the BID, with a focus on the relations with urban governance actors 'above' (city planning department, public housing, real estate companies, media, politicians) and 'below' (residents and local businesses). Despite general claims around BIDs as successful tools for uplifting distressed neighbourhoods, BID Gamlestaden presents shortcomings regarding issues of urban social justice in terms of democratic participation and representation (democracy), disciplining and sanitizing strategies (diversity) and gentrification risks (equality). In fact, while BID partners notice improved attractiveness and sense of security and higher estate values, this improvement is based upon the removal of the most socio-economically vulnerable residents and the disciplining of residents' and businesses' behaviours and aesthetics. This study warns about the risk that BIDs as they are currently implemented in Sweden are used as a 'neoliberal fix' to move social problems elsewhere rather than solving them, which might lead to new landscapes of exclusion and gentrification.

AB  - Wind power production is expanding globally and with this comes social resistance. In this article, we study controversies concerning the expansion of wind power in Sweden between 2009 and 2022. To this end, we study national press coverage and local press coverage from Sweden's 290 municipalities. Despite previous studies showing that Swedish people are generally in favour of expanding wind power, our results show that this policy is controversial and often is met with significant local resistance. We identify a clash between two environmental concerns: developing national policies to mitigate the effects of climate change and local opinions calling for the preservation of natural landscapes, which are often coupled with concerns about whether expansion of wind power leads to positive climate effects. We analyse national and local discourses through a multi-level governance perspective, a view that argues Sweden's market-oriented and decentralized wind power planning regime feeds the controversy. In conclusion, the dispersal of power throughout the planning system facilitates scaling up of local resistance to an energy policy issue of national concern, creating significant uncertainty about the expansion of wind power in Sweden.

AB  - The industrial production of building elements has hastened the planning and construction processes, which is one factor that has accelerated the growth of tourist destinations. The signs of tourism burdening environment are also increasing in the northern periphery. It is possible to set sustainable objectives for the development of tourism by using landscape analysis. Several kinds of landscape analysis were carried out at the Yllas, Levi and Olos tourist destinations in the Ounasselka fell region in western Finnish Lapland. A group of specialists representing different disciplines studied the cultural, visual and ecological aspects of the landscape. Different physical elements and the perception of the landscape were analysed to indicate the landscape values and environmental state of the study areas and to demonstrate a tool package for the sustainable land use management of tourist destinations that are sensitive to change. The set of landscape analyses included information on geology, landscape structure, visual landscape, landscape image, soundscape and urban and green zones. Multidisciplinary landscape analysis that illustrates landscape from various points of view can assist the tourism managers and land use in many ways. It helps to find the places special and meaningful to tourists and local people (socio-cultural) and the most suitable building sites (ecological and visual sustainability). It also assists in determining the sustainable level of tourist activities, the acceptable change in landscape structure and land use and in creating a greenbelt system to buffer against the compaction typical to urbanization. Additionally, it can work as a system to monitor transformation and landscape change at tourist destinations. The set of methods were demonstrated and developed in the EU LIFE Environment funded project Tourist Destinations as Landscape Laboratories - Tools for Sustainable Tourism (LANDSCAPE LAB).

AB  - The amount of dead wood in forests has decreased owing to modern forest practices, and many species associated with this habitat are currently threatened. In Sweden during the last decade, naturally downed logs have been retained and, at clearcuts, high stumps have been artificially created to maintain saproxylic (dead wood dependent) insects. We tested how much these types of dead wood are used by sampling saproxylic beetles in dead wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.; Pinaceae) in managed forests in central Sweden. To analyse how surveys should be conducted in these kinds of studies, we compared three methods over an entire growing season. We found that the relationship between the type of dead wood and species richness was statistically significant when we used bark sieving and emergence traps, but not when we used window traps. It is impossible to ascertain whether beetles collected with window traps are related to the type of dead wood on which they are found and, therefore, such traps are less useful in studies of specific substrates. The yield from sieving was highest in spring and autumn, whereas species richness in window trap samples peaked in June and July and that in emergence traps peaked from May to July. With emergence traps we collected, on average, about twice the number of species over the whole season as we did by sieving on a single occasion in the spring. Both emergence trapping and sieving reveal what is present in individual pieces of dead wood, but these methods sample partly different faunas. We found fewer species on artificially created high stumps (on clearcuts); however, these stumps seem to be useful for some red-listed species.

AB  - Stumps from clear cuts are increasingly used for bioenergy. Extracting this wood will reduce the habitat available for saproxylic (wood-living) organisms. As little is known about the species assemblages that will be affected, we investigated the diversity of saproxylic beetles in stumps on clear-felled sites and as a reference, we compared it with the diversity in downed logs. Stumps and logs of aspen (Populus tremolo L.), birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. verrucosa Ehrh.[syn. B. pendula Roth]), spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and pine (Pious sylvestris L.) were examined in clear cuts of two different ages: one summer old and 4-5 years old. The beetles were sampled by sieving bark (0.25 m(2)) peeled from the wood. The samples were taken in pairs of one log and one stump situated close together and of the same tree species, age since death and diameter. In total 3348 saproxylic beetles belonging to 124 species were found in 176 samples. The stumps had a similar number of species to the logs both as measured per sample and as an accumulated number. Exceptions were 4-5 years old wood of birch and pine where the number was significantly higher in the stumps. The number of red-listed species was also similar between stumps and logs. Species composition was more different between the stumps and logs of conifers than of deciduous trees. We conclude that clear-felled stumps have a diverse saproxylic insect fauna. This has to be taken into account if large scale extraction of logging stumps is implemented.

AB  - Given the unprecedented biodiversity crisis and scarcity of conservation resources, each single conservation effort must be allocated cost-effectively. Therefore, there is a growing need to evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, particularly in the case of large and charismatic predators that have attracted a large share of species conservation funding. In Finland, conservation interventions aimed at protecting nest sites of the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla were initiated based on general concerns of increasing disturbance posed by human encroachment and forestry practices. We evaluated the current effectiveness of this conservation program. We found that neither nest occupancy nor breeding success of white-tailed eagles were affected by the protection status of the land in which the nest was located (protected areas or unprotected land), or by the size of the area under protection. In addition, the type of forest management at the nest site or the presence and vicinity of anthropogenic infrastructures (roads and buildings) did not have any apparent effect on nesting eagles. Our results are encouraging, as they show that the white-tailed eagle breeds successfully in landscapes under intensive forestry, and thus the future of the species appears not to be threatened by forest management. Our results furthermore allow updating the allocation of resources for nature conservation in Finland, potentially by prioritizing more cost-effective conservation programs on other species and ecosystems.

AB  - Species-rich semi-natural grasslands are declining all over northern Europe, and many plant species confined to such grasslands are currently under threat. We studied the development of populations of one such species, the field gentian Gentianella campestris, during three decades in the County of Sodermanland, south of Stockholm, Sweden. Gentianella campestris is Red Listed as Endangered in Sweden. It is a strict biennial, and as far as known with only a transient seed bank. Large population fluctuations are a characteristic of this species, and its life history makes the species inherently sensitive to factors causing population reductions. We found that the number of sites with G. campestris has declined with over 60% in the last three decades. The total number of flowering individuals also show a strong decreasing trend, although there was an increase the last year (2020) at a few remaining sites. Cessation of grazing management is a major cause of the decline, but populations also disappeared from managed sites. It is possible that the management has been inappropriate, and circumstantial evidence suggests that summer drought might be an additional cause of population decline. Data from 2018, a year with an exceptional summer drought, supports this explanation. A sowing experiment indicated that recruitment of new populations is unlikely in the present-day landscape where most vegetation is unsuitable for G. campestris. Due to the poor prospects for long-term maintenance of grazing management in still remaining semi-natural grasslands, and the decline even at sites with current management, G. campestris faces a risk of becoming regionally extinct within the coming decades.

AB  - Although biodiversity is crucial for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), following the current trajectory, we risk failing SDG 15. Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km(2) of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km(2)). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km(2)) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs. Using indices of functional connectivity is crucial for environmental impact assessments, as entire ecological networks for several species can be affected far beyond the reservoirs.

AB  - We studied the occurrence of Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita at the Finnish and Russian border at ca. 65 degrees N. This species shows an interesting distribution in the region, being virtually absent from the Finnish side (Kainuu) but being a common breeder on the Russian side (Viena). However, the species has been equally numerous on both sides of the border. In our study area, the landscape is structurally different on opposite sides of the border: in Russia, there is a continuous "green belt" of old-growth forests, whereas in Finland old-growth forests are embedded in a matrix of managed forests. However, fragmentation may not solely explain the difference in Chiffchaff abundance, because bird species even more strictly dependent on old-growth forests are either nearly equally or were even more abundant in Finland than in Russia. We suggest that the decline of the Finnish Chiffchaff population is due to multiple reasons, including the northern location. Fragmentation has probably provided the final push resulting in a crash in the Kainuu Chiffchaff population. This study underlines the need for detailed species-specific autecological knowledge in predicting fragmentation effects. Furthermore, a change in subspecific composition of Finnish and Swedish Chiffchaffs is apparently taking place. The ecologically different yet morphologically similar Ph. c. collybita may replace the native Ph. c. abietinus.

AB  - Anodonta anatina, a widely distributed Eurasian freshwater mussel, has dramatically declined and listed as endangered species in IUCN Red List in some parts of the Europe. To better understand its basic biology and possible sex-dependent effects of parasitism on reproduction, we investigated the reproductive traits, trematode parasitism and growth between November 2020 and October 2021. Our data from a Finnish population indicates male-biased sex ratio and the gonadal development lasting throughout the year with a bradytictic brooding pattern. Gonadosomatic index of both sexes peaked in May and declined in June. Mature oocytes were smaller sized than those of previously studied unionids, fecundity was fairly low, and the maximum predicted lifespan was 14 years. Gonads were infected with digenean trematode parasites, Rhipidocotyle campanula being the dominant species. Interestingly, trematode infection rate was higher in females than in males. In July, when the water temperature reached its annual maximum, the trematode prevalence also peaked, which was accompanied with 16% of mussels being sterile. The trematode parasitism was thus negatively associated with reproduction, that might become even more affected if parasitism increases along with the predicted climate warming, which should be considered in possible future conservation and aquaculture efforts of this species.

AB  - Pinus dalatensis Ferre (Dalat pine, or five-needle pine, locally) is an endemic large tree species of Vietnam that has both high timber and non-timber values. It is also a rare tree species listed in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The objective of this study was to develop an individual tree diameter growth modeling system to facilitate the sustainable management and conservation of this species. We used Haglof Sweden (R) increment borers to collect tree ring samples from a total of 56 trees resulting in a dataset of 4566 diameter at breast height (dbh, cm) measurements at age (t, year) and obtained the associated ecological environmental factors in three different sites in the Central Highlands, Vietnam. A subset of this dataset (n = 1264) also had the climate data collected over the period of past 32-38 years (from 1980 to 2011 and from 1979 to 2016). Weighted mixed-effects models were used to model Dalat pine trees growth and account for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity of the dbh measurements. Cross validation over 200 realizations were used to select the best equation form of dbh growth and incorporate the environmental effects and climatic factors that help improve reliability of the models. Under the mixed-effects modeling paradigm, the Mitscherlich equation fitted with random effects of ecological environmental factors (eco-subregions and altitude) and climatic factors (temperature, humidity, and temperature in dry and in rainy seasons) produced the best results. Whereas, under the fixed-effect modeling paradigm, the models that used the exponential function of environmental or climatic factors as the modifiers of an average diameter growth performed the best (Bias = -5.9% and RMSE = 10.0 cm). The models developed in this study will be useful for forecasting growth and for silvicultural planning under shifting environment and climate and are expected to contribute to the sustainable management of this endemic species.

AB  - Quercus robur (oaks) provides an important substrate for many epiphytic lichens, and with increasing age the bark becomes suitable for some rare species. These species may respond to environmental and landscape factors differently, and at different spatial scales. We tested the effect of factors related to the individual tree and the surrounding landscape on the occurrence and richness patterns of lichens species. The study system consisted of 213 oaks selected in a grid system within a 400 km(2) heterogeneous oak-rich area in south-eastern Sweden. Oaks had been selected to be relatively uniform in size (circumference 3.1-4.1 m), and as uniformly distributed as possible in the study area. Landscape factors were calculated for various spatial scales (circles with radius ranging from 28 to 1225 m from a studied oak). One of the landscape factors stands out as of general importance oak density in the surrounding while the others (amount of forest, water, houses and arable field) had no effects, or weak effects on only some species. Among the tree specific variables, circumference was consistently important (despite ranging from only 3.1-4.1 m) while inconsistent effects were seen by sun exposure of oak trunk (Chaenotheca phaeocephala, Ramalina baltica) and density of shrubs and trees near the tree (Ch. phaeocephala). The occurrence patterns of Cliostomum corrugatum, Ch. phaeocephala, R. baltica and richness (number of eleven target lichens) were best explained by the density of oaks within radii of 401, 199, 199 and 303 m, respectively. In conclusion, our study highlighted the importance of spatial scale for understanding the occurrence of epiphytic lichens and suggests spatial scales and oak densities that could be targeted for landscape and conservation planning.

AB  - The use of indicator species in forest conservation and management planning can facilitate enhanced preservation of biodiversity from the negative effects of forestry and other uses of land. However, this requires detailed and spatially comprehensive knowledge of the habitat preferences and distributions of selected focal indicator species. Unfortunately, due to limited resources for field surveys, only a small proportion of the occurrences of focal species is usually known. This shortcoming can be circumvented by using modeling techniques to predict the spatial distribution of suitable sites for the target species. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and other remote sensing (RS) techniques have the potential to provide useful environmental data covering systematically large areas for these purposes. Here, we focused on six bird of prey and woodpecker species known to be good indicators of boreal forest biodiversity values. We used known nest sites of the six indicator species based on nestling ringing records. Thus, the most suitable nesting sites of these species provide important information for biodiversity-friendly forest management and conservation planning. We developed fine-grained, that is, 96 x 96 m grid cell resolution, predictive maps across the whole of Finland of the suitable nesting habitats based on ALS and other RS data and spatial information on the distribution of important forest stands for the six studied biodiversity indicator bird species based on nesting-habitat suitability modeling, that is, the MaxEnt model. Habitat preferences of the study species, as determined by MaxEnt, were in line with the previous knowledge of species-habitat relations. The proportion of suitable habitats of these species in protected areas (PAs) was considerable, but our analysis also revealed many potentially high-quality forest stands outside PAs. However, many of these sites are increasingly threatened by logging because of increased pressures for using forests for bioeconomy and forest industry based on National Forest Strategy. Predicting habitat suitability based on information on the nest sites of indicator species provides a new tool for systematic conservation planning over large areas in boreal forests in Europe, and a corresponding approach would also be feasible and recommendable elsewhere where similar data are available.

AB  - Humanity is challenged with making progress toward global biodiversity, freshwater, and climate goals, while providing food and nutritional security for everyone. Our current food and land-use systems are incompatible with this ambition making them unsustainable. Papers in this special feature introduce a participatory, integrated modeling approach applied to provide insights on how to transform food and land-use systems to sustainable trajectories in 12 countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Finland, India, Mexico, Rwanda, Sweden, the UK, and USA. Papers are based on work completed by members of the Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-use, and Energy (FABLE) initiative, a network of in-country research teams engaging policymakers and other local stakeholders to co-develop future food and land-use scenarios and modeling their national and global sustainability impacts. Here, we discuss the key leverage points, methodological advances, and multi-sector engagement strategies presented and applied in this collection of work to set countries and our planet on course for achieving food security, biodiversity, freshwater, and climate targets by 2050.

AB  - The study describes how qualitative stakeholder feedback can be used in quantitative scenarios to simulate forest resource use under alternative management objectives. In earlier studies in the region of eastern Finland, stakeholders did not see a possible conflict between increased bioenergy use and nature conservation; this finding is contrary to the results of other studies. The aim of this study was to test with a quantitative modelling approach whether the stakeholder expectation holds and whether forest management in eastern Finland can simultaneously increase biomass utilization and biodiversity protection. Prior to this study, three alternative scenarios on forest resource use were created in a participatory stakeholder process, involving a broad range of stakeholders, with half of them being from research and education. In the current study, a large-scale forest resource planning model (MELA) and a sustainability impact assessment tool (ToSIA) were used to simulate the different alternative scenarios and present the results back to the stakeholders in order to evaluate them. The scenarios were evaluated by stakeholders using multi-criteria analysis. In a survey, the stakeholders indicated that biodiversity, employment, recreational value and greenhouse gas emissions were the most important indicators to them, whereas growing stock, amount of harvested roundwood, energy wood and protected forest area were considered less important. Of the created scenarios, the scenario combining bioenergy and biodiversity targets was the most preferred by the stakeholders as it performed well on those indicators that were identified by stakeholders as the most important. In this scenario, the area of protected forest and bioenergy production were increased simultaneously. With this study we offer a framework for evaluating different alternatives for future land use. The framework helps to identify key issues that are important to the stakeholders so that they can be taken into consideration in future land-use planning. In addition, the results confirm the stakeholder expectation that by protecting more forests while simultaneously increasing the mobilization of potentially available wood resources, both targets can be met without compromising too much other forest functions such as timber production and recreation.

AB  - Extensive use of aquatic habitats, mainly for hydropower and aquaculture, has a negative impact on anadromous salmonid populations of the Hardangerfjord region, western Norway. High infection levels of salmon lice, and high proportions of escaped farmed salmon in spawning rivers, appear to violate the goals in the Strategy for an Environmentally Sustainable Aquaculture Industry' set by the Norwegian government. An overview of the anadromous populations in the fjord, their status and the major threats are presented. A conservation plan with mitigation efforts consisting of seven steps is presented: (1) genetic assessment of Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout populations, (2) reducing gene flow from escapees, (3) reducing infection pressure from salmon lice, (4) conduct an assessment of the freshwater habitats for anadromous salmonids and then implement it in order to restore smolt production, (5) efforts to reduce risk of river pollution from agriculture and industry and minimize impacts from hydropower production, (6) when and where necessary and practical, plant out eyed eggs from the Norwegian Genebank to increase parr and smolt production, and finally, (7) monitor spawning populations and parr densities to evaluate potential effects of the mitigation efforts. Experience and knowledge gained through the plan will be useful for other regions with similar challenges. We call for an initiative to establish a national fund under democratic and public control, where funding can be obtained for projects which focus on mitigation efforts and conservation of salmonid populations.

AB  - Wild ungulates play a key role in the management and governance of Swedish wildlife. They are primarily harvested for meat, but are also important for non-consumptive uses of wildlife such as recreation. However, due to browsing and crop raiding, ungulates also reduce the forest's economic value and make it difficult for farmers to maintain agricultural practices. While current policies and regulations clearly indicate that wildlife is to be treated as a valuable, others may disagree. This setting provided an opportunity to study the search for mutually acceptable outcomes and working relationships in parallel to the state-regulated management arrangements. The shared and disputed issues in the studied case echo the broader issues of entitlement to resources and value transformation that can stabilise but also disturb or even disrupt environmental management. The diverging interests, claims and experiences of forestry, hunting, farming, recreation, and protection, expressed in their own voices and consolidated into narratives about land, land use, and rights and obligations, can be seen as an important driver of collective action. The connections between the experiences of and the dynamics behind the decision to collaborate reveal a contested space in which the commercial wood industries, agriculture, the decentralised state, conservation, and recreational interests are all involved and must negotiate with one-another to secure their interests. The participants justify their actions symbolically, referring to an idiom of rights, the construct of forestry's importance for the public good, and the desire to be resourceful and authoritative outside the framework of state action.

AB  - A Holocene calcareous tufa deposit in the Fyledalen Valley in southern Sweden was investigated with respect to molluscs, pollen, plant macrofossils and Coleoptera remains. The investigation recovered four mollusc species that today are severely threatened and included in the Swedish Red List of Endangered Species and/or the European Community's Natura 2000 programme. These include Vertigo genesii (Gredler), Vertigo geyeri Lindholm, Cochlicopa nitens (Gallenstein) and Vertigo moulinsiana (Dupuy). Tufa formation was initiated in the early Preboreal (after 11 500 cal. BP), when an open birchpine forest dominated the area and stopped in the late Boreal (after 8800 cal. BP) when deciduous trees had become established. The presence of the molluscan species Vallonia pulchella (Muller), Columella columella (Martens). Vertigo genesii, Pupilla muscorum (L.) and Euconulus alderi (Gray), coupled with an almost complete lack of shade-demanding taxi, suggests an open marsh environment throughout the time of tufa deposition. The mollusc succession shows evidence of increasing temperature. Columella columella, commonly associated with open arctic-alpine habitats is present at the base of the profile in the early Preboreal, whilst Vertigo genesii, which commonly is associated with open arctic-alpine habitats or calcareous springs, persists until the mid-Boreal (similar to 8800 cal. BP). The tufa deposition ends when the regional groundwater levels rise, approximately 8800 cal. BP, more thermophilous molluscs, such as Vertigo moulinsiana and V angustior Jeffreys and the aquatic Bithynia tentaculata (L.). Radii peregra (Muller) and Planorbis planorbis (L.) colonize the site. Stratigraphic correlations. as well as faunal and floral comparisons, are made with nearby sites.

AB  - Sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands induced by mountain summer farming in Budalen, central Norway, can be divided into two main habitats: small enclosures at each summer farm site, and the pastures surrounding them. Enclosures are exposed to different land-use regimes including grazing, mowing, fertilisation and soil disturbance. Pastures have never been fertilised or ploughed and the current grazing pressure is moderate. All investigated pastures are former haymaking areas. Higher conservation values of pastures compared to enclosures is reflected both in patterns of species richness and the occurrence of vulnerable species. Higher species richness in pastures is related to lower nutrient levels, lower loss of ignition in the soil, and higher levels of pH. Vulnerable species are concentrated in species-rich pastures, and have tow local abundance and regional distribution. Enclosures reflect a complexity in land-use, were the effects of mowing, fertilising and ploughing on plant community patterns could not be separated. Tree and shrub species are common in both habitats, and indicate a successional invasion of woody species. Maintenance of land-uses that have created semi-natural grasslands in the long term perspective (grazing, cutting of trees and shrubs, and mowing) is necessary to prevent forest succession, and a prerequisite for future conservation of sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - The Habitats Directive of the European Union is a key legislative instrument in Europe, supporting the conservation of rare, threatened or endemic species. It aims at ensuring that the species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive show a favourable conservation status, i.e., that they are able to maintain viable populations and that their natural range is sufficient and not decreasing currently, nor will in the future. However, climate change may hamper Habitats Directive species in achieving (or maintaining) a favourable conservation status, particularly when these impacts are amplified by adverse land use. Here, we studied Habitats Directive species in Finland for which >= 70% of the occurrences were recorded with the resolution of <= 100 m. The number of occurrence sites for the 52 species studied ranged from one site to 13,653 sites, summing up to 19,367 sites. For all these sites and their surroundings, we assessed the vulnerabilities caused by climate change and land use. The climate exposure of occurrence sites was measured based on the rapidity of climatic changes (i.e. climate velocity) in three climate variables (growing degree days, mean January air temperature, water balance) at each site. Risks caused by land use were assessed using two negative and four positive variables that respectively described the quantity of land cover and habitats that is either harmful (e.g. clear-cut forest and drained peatlands) or supportive (protected areas and suitable habitats) to species occurrences. To complement climate and land-use variables, three additional variables describing protection status of the sites and the number of occurrences of the same species in the landscape were examined. Comparison of the mean vulnerability values for each species showed that some of the species inhabit, on average, areas with high climate exposure. Moreover, in certain species climate change-induced vulnerabilities consistently coincide with negative land use. However, in many of the 52 species there was large variation in the vulnerability levels between individual occurrence sites, concerning both climate exposure and land-use variables. Considering the vulnerabilities due to climate change separately, 40-60% of the species occurrence sites are expected to face high exposure caused by rapid changes in summer or winter temperatures, which presents challenges in maintaining a favourable conservation status. Our results also revealed numerous species occurrences where high climate velocity coincided with a large amount of negative land use and low amount of suitable habitat, for which climate-wise conservation planning could be targeted.

AB  - Sustainable communities are promoted as a desirable policy goal and, in particular, local authorities are encouraged to contribute to climate change mitigation through urban planning. Furthermore, recent research takes a broad perspective on the environmental sustainability of urban areas and considers the environmental impact of all consumption. A focus group study was conducted in Finland for the purpose of examining how increased environmental awareness influences urban land use. The 32 participants of three focus groups were professionals of urban planning and environmental sustainability, at both a municipal and a state level. The main finding was that urban planning is viewed as being unable to support environmental sustainability in the broader sense. In general, the participants did not see a connection between urban structure and sustainable lifestyles and only the influence of planning on housing and daily journeys was recognised. Three main reasons for this were identified. Firstly, environmental sustainability in its broader definition is seen as too complex for urban planners to influence alone. Secondly, the dominance of short-term economic issues in decision-making and the lack of co-operation from other stakeholders to achieve environmental aims demotivate land use planners. Thirdly, the prioritisation of urban density may overrule alternative means of promoting environmental sustainability, such as the encouragement of sustainable suburban or non-urban lifestyles.

AB  - The integration of conservation into management of non-industrial private forests rests with professional foresters. This paper empirically examines the intentions of foresters to conserve habitats beyond what is the minimum legally defined requirement when planning forestry operations: either by delineating particular habitats defined in the Finnish Forest Act completely outside the operation, despite this not being the obligation, or by delineating other valuable habitats that are not defined in the law. This type of voluntary exceeding of minimum conservation requirements is dependent on professional judgment, which is the focus of this article. The analysis applies the theory of planned behaviour, according to which intentions to behave in a particular fashion are influenced by attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived control over the behaviour. The investigation pays attention to behavioural and normative beliefs as well as other contextual factors influencing habitat delineation practice. The data consist of 311 survey responses (response rate 58%) of Finnish foresters planning forestry operations in non-industrial private forests, employed by public, private and associational organisations. The model is rather powerful in explaining intentions to exceed the minimum requirements. We find social norms to have a strong influence on delineation intentions. This effect is stronger in the case of delineation of other valuable habitats than in the more standardised delineation of legally defined habitats where the foresters have broader experience and consider themselves more autonomous. Normative beliefs relative to other foresters' expectations dominate the general subjective norm, signalling a primacy of a professional norm and the importance of peer networks. Also the general attitude has a strong influence on intentions, whereas the effect of perception of control is low. Past behaviour predicts intentions, which implies tradition and habit to have an important role in defining the way biodiversity conservation is integrated into forest management. In other words, abrupt changes are unlikely to occur in an institutionalized practice. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of policy implementation as well as governance of multiple functions of forests more generally. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetland forest communities are seriously reduced and degraded throughout most of Europe, but significant areas still survive in the east and north-east. Data from 91 forest structures that support biodiversity are analysed in 369 releves of Latvian wetland forests. These structures include variations in topography, stand composition, water movement and dead wood features occurring in semi-natural conditions undisturbed by management. There is clear structural differentiation between coniferous and deciduous wetlands. The study supports the widely held views on European forest quality: low volume of high-diameter (>50 cm) snags and logs, too few overmature trees, and the threat to pattern heterogeneity caused by traditional forestry and silviculture. Twenty areas (totalling c. 3800 ha) are identified as reserves that should be strictly protected in Latvia in order to maintain representative and intact samples of wet forest belonging to Eurosiberian alder swamps (Alnetea glutinosae), broad-leaved forests (Querco-Fagetea) and boreal forest (Vaccinio-Piceetea) communities. Based on habitat features and site ecology, the concept of sustainable forestry must be incorporated widely in utilization of European wetland forests in order to prevent further loss of biodiversity.

AB  - Dead wood is a critical resource for biodiversity in boreal forests. We analysed the persistence of five model species inhabiting dead wood. By parameterising a metapopulation model (the incidence function model), the model species were all assigned characteristics that makes it likely that they have disappeared from some (20%) forest landscapes with a long history of forest management. In the metapopulation model, a forest stand (5 ha) was regarded as a habitat patch. The amount of habitat in each patch was obtained from models of dead wood dynamics of Norway spruce in central Sweden. Dead wood generated by altered management over the entire landscape was found to be less efficient in reducing extinction risks in comparison to the same amount of dead wood generated by protecting reserves. Because generation of dead wood by altered management is often less expensive than setting aside reserves, it is difficult to determine which conservation measure is most cost-efficient. In a landscape subjected to forestry for the first time, it was better to preserve a few large reserves than many small ones. However, in a managed, highly fragmented forest landscape it was better to set aside many small reserves. The reason for this was that small plots with high habitat quality could be selected, while large reserves originally contained habitats both of high and low quality, and the rate of habitat quality increase was low. A strategy for biodiversity conservation in a managed forest landscape should include information about the history of the landscape, the current amount and spatial distribution of forest habitats, and the potential for rapid restoration of forest habitats, both on managed and unmanaged forest land.

AB  - In this study we ask how the planning process that coordinates the interests of various sectors on a municipal level affects the cultural heritage assets in suburban landscapes. Special attention is paid to the role the cultural heritage management sector plays in the overall planning processes that take place in such semi-urban regions.
   A case study is carried out in two suburban areas in Norway, Madla and Nannestad. The case-study design includes various methods: historical map overlay, visual methods, discourse analysis based on qualitative interviews and document studies. The case studies have been performed on two levels: a superior landscape analysis covering the total municipality, and a second and more detailed level.
   The results from this study show that the protection and caretaking of green interests in land-use planning is not necessarily a protection of cultural heritage interests. Cultural heritage is more to be seen as a derivate interest. Cultural heritage management seldom functions as a premise provider in municipal planning. The findings are discussed in conjunction with the need for comprehensive planning across administrative and disciplinary borders as cities grow into regions. There is also a need for the cultural heritage interests to play a stronger role in planning in order to obtain better preservation of the cultural monuments and landscapes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the last decades, the access to mineral raw material deposits has been increasingly limited by diverse limitations and obstacles. Some of them including: permits, taxes and fees, the ownership of mineral deposits, environmental protection rules and land-use and spatial planning conflicts, are related to state (governmental) activities and others such as protests against the mining activity and NIM-BY effect, to societal issues. The legal authorities, governments and regulators are the stakeholders involved in the legislative issues of this process. A major potential matter of dispute lies in land-use issues. D iverse land-use types, for example, nature conservation, tourism and building development, can restrict the area available for exploration and/or mining, and thus access to mineral deposits. The nature of the land-use competition seems to be similar in different countries and regions, and so do the land-use conflicts. However, the scale and the underlying reasons of the land-use conflicts may differ. This also applies to the approaches to solve the problems.
   The aim of the study is to identify and analyze the sources and types of legislative and governmental/executive constraints on mineral activities, which can limit the future potential for mineral raw materials and mineable mineral resources. Ultimately, restricted accessibility can reduce the competiveness of the European minerals industry. For these reasons, the active resolution and prevention of conflicts and the implementation of well-defined legislation are crucial elements to support the sustainability of the European minerals industry. This publication is a summary of the analyses carried out in the framework of a recently completed project entitled Minerals4EU that was one of the flagship projects of the recent years. Mineral deposits accessibility issues in the EU was one of the topics of raw materials foresight. PGI-NRI was the topic leader and National Geological Surveys from Finland, Sweden and Croatia were the partners. The Minerals 4EU project was financed by the European Commission. In addition to the EU countries, the following countries also participated: Norway, Switzerland, (associated countries), Albania, Ukraine and also UK after Brexit.

AB  - More cities have started trajectories to become climate neutral, especially for their territorial emissions. However, while cities are also targeting consumption-based emissions, whether their plans are sufficient to become climate neutral from both a territorial and a consumption-based perspective remains unclear. We designed a conceptual framework based on a literature review of urban climate mitigation and reviewed mitigation-related documents from nine Swedish cities. We found a strong political will and solid targets but gaps in the plans and actions mostly related to transport, construction and food. Municipal governments use "soft" policy instruments to meet climate targets; at times, economic instruments contradict the vision. Our evaluation indicates a disconnect between intent and outcomes. More regulatory instruments must be deployed to become climate-neutral, and economic incentives must be aligned with the vision. Understanding how climate mitigation strategies affect resources within the city will be necessary to ensure the acceptance and uptake of climate action plans. Collaboration with superordinate governments, within and outside national borders, will be essential to align on policy and policy instruments.

AB  - Alnus glutinosa (alder) swamp woodlands are in danger of disappearing in Europe and, in Norway, several habitats with alder are threatened. Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site, Rambjora, in western Norway encompasses the Rambjara Landscape Protected Area. We combined information from three sources recent alder swamp woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history to reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambjora in relation to land-use. Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland over 2800 years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment. The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, hay mowing, and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting) should be part of the future management in order to maintain the biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambjora. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys, pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when establishing conservation strategies. Our findings need to be considered in future conservation and restoration of ecosystems with alder swamp woodlands. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper analyzes how sustained yield (SY) forestry is defined and implemented in Sweden and Russia, two countries with different forest-industrial regimes. We first compare definitions of SY forestry in national legislation and policies. Then we study forest management planning in two large forest management units with respect to: delivered forest products and values, how the harvest level of timber is defined, where the harvest takes place, and what treatments are used to sustain desired forest products and values. In Sweden SY forestry is maximum yield based on high-input forest management, and in Russia it is forestry based on natural regeneration with minimum investments in silviculture. We conclude that how SY forestry contributes to SFM depends on the context. Finally, we discuss the consequences of SY forestry as performed in Sweden and Russia related to its ability to support diverse forest functions, as envisioned in sustainable forest management policy.

AB  - Human-induced habitat loss and degradation are major threats to wetland species as reflected in the fact that wetlands have declined by more than 50% in Europe and North America during the last century. Both current and historic land-use patterns are likely to be significant determinants of wetland species' distributions; however their relative importance is often unknown. We studied the importance of local (study pond) and landscape (current and 18th-century landscape) characteristics in explaining the occurrence and species richness of amphibians (Rana arvalis, Bufo bufo, and Triturus vulgaris) on the Swedish island of Gotland, where more than 40% of wetlands have been lost since the 18th century. Current local habitat characteristics were the strongest determinants of occurrence for all study species. Additionally, species occurrence was related to current and historic landscape characteristics, which generally explained equal amounts of the variation in species-occurrence data. The proportions of both current and historic arable land were negative determinants of amphibian occurrence and species richness, indicating that agricultural land use may have an overall negative impact on amphibians, and that amphibians may occur less frequently in areas with a long agricultural history. Likewise, historic forest area was positively related to B. bufo occurrence and species richness, whereas current forests had no significant effects, suggesting that there may be a lag in the response of amphibians to agriculture-mediated habitat loss. Our results suggest that historic land-use patterns may influence current amphibian populations and that inclusion of historic land-use information could be a valuable tool in future studies on amphibian-habitat relations.

AB  - This paper describes so-called city growth agreements and city environmental agreements in Norway and Sweden, respectively. We do case studies of two regions in Norway and two cities in Sweden. While the general aim of the agreements is similar in the two countries, namely for the central government to influence municipal infrastructure building in a more environmentally sustainable direction, the agreements differ in many respects. While the Norwegian agreements consist of several projects concerning the construction of roads and railroads, and infrastructure for public transport, pedestrians, and cycling, the Swedish agreements only concern one (type of) project at a time. Moreover, Norway emphasizes city planning more; even though the building of new housing is important also in Sweden, location and densification are less so. The Swedish projects are municipality driven, while the Norwegian system is based on reciprocal negotiations between the municipalities, the county, and the state. The Norwegian model fits better into a theoretical fiscal federalism-based framework than the Swedish one, with the state internalizing spatial spillovers arising from infrastructure projects. In Sweden, the agreements are better to be seen as means for institutionalized lobbying by municipalities.

AB  - The recent tourism development plans for nature-based tourism destinations have raised concerns about how sustainable land use targets can be achieved. In Lapland, Northern Finland, the aim is to double the annual visitor rates by 2020 by boosting construction, which may threaten the quality of the landscape and the perceived environment. The tourism destinations should meet clients' environmental expectations and, therefore, it is important to assess the acceptability and desirability of ongoing or anticipated land use changes.
   This research aimed at studying tourists' environmental and accommodation preferences in northern Lapland tourism destinations. Altogether, 1054 foreign and domestic tourists participated in the on-site survey carried out during 2009-2010 at two main tourism destinations in Finnish Lapland. The respondents were asked about their willingness to engage in sustainable tourism practices, as well as their evaluation of different land use development options in the tourism destinations.
   The results suggest that building density and patterns are important in defining the quality of the environment in tourism destinations, as they affect the nature experiences associated with accommodation. The tourists valued small-scale accommodation units, habitat protection, green infrastructure, and easy access to authentic nature in the environs of their accommodation site. The study results stress the need for careful planning and design in tourism destinations while aiming for eco-efficient land use. The efforts include conservation of natural forest vegetation and landscaping practices, in addition to ensuring views of nature from the accommodation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse and reflect upon the process and outcome of a potential clash between urban biodiversity and road transport interests in the Swedish city of center dot Orebro, as a case of planning in the face of conflict. Combining an application of multilevel governance theory with negotiation planning and narrative method, it examines the siting of a huge warehouse and "logistics centre" at the edge of a Natura 2000 site on the outskirts of the city. Despite the city's ambitious environmental goals and sustainability profile, the local authority decided to offer the company a site adjacent to a wetland area intended for preserving and developing biodiversity. After an intervention by the central state County Administrative Board [la center dot nsstyrelsen], the local authority had to implement certain security measures, and also reserve an additional, large natural land area to compensate for the threats to the Natura 2000 site. Before the final decision was made, a series of negotiations occurred between the involved actors, mainly the local authority, the multinational Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia and the County Administrative Board, and the case is a fruitful target for a multifaceted analysis illuminating the tension between the goals of preserving urban biodiversity and promoting road transport and urban growth. It also offers an inside view of the negotiation and planning process. The key issue is how the siting of a potentially hazardous, transport intensive national warehouse in a city renowned for its high environmentalprotection profile was possible. Considering Sweden's high-profile regarding sustainability, the selected case also offers food for reflection on the potentials and barriers of implementing ecological modernization more generally. The lessons learned from an examination of the local authority's attempt to harmonize such diverse policy priorities as urban biodiversity and intensive road transport for economic growth, on a site adjacent to a Natura 2000 wetlands area, may help enable urban planners and scholars to find creative policy solutions, avoid causing damage to biodiversity, and increase ecosystem values in terms of residents' and other visitors' experience and understanding of nature. However, at the end of the article we address the question of whether our empirical conclusion is not "too good to be true", and raise concerns regarding the intricate relationship between sustainability and resilience; the systemic power exerted by the global Sonepar Group/Elektroskandia; and the potentials and limits of public negotiation planning.

AB  - Urbanization results in the systemic conversion of land-use, driving habitat and biodiversity loss. The "urban convergence hypothesis" posits that urbanization represents a merging of habitat characteristics, in turn driving physiological and functional responses within the biotic community. To test this hypothesis, we sampled five cities (Baltimore, MD, United States; Helsinki and Lahti, Finland; Budapest, Hungary; Potchefstroom, South Africa) across four different biomes. Within each city, we sampled four land-use categories that represented a gradient of increasing disturbance and management (from least intervention to highest disturbance: reference, remnant, turf/lawn, and ruderal). Previously, we used amplicon sequencing that targeted bacteria/archaea (16S rRNA) and fungi (ITS) and reported convergence in the archaeal community. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing and QPCR of functional genes to the same soil DNA extracts to test convergence in microbial function. Our results suggest that urban land-use drives changes in gene abundance related to both the soil N and C metabolism. Our updated analysis found taxonomic convergence in both the archaeal and bacterial community (16S amplicon data). Convergence of the archaea was driven by increased abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea and genes for ammonia oxidation (QPCR and shotgun metagenomics). The proliferation of ammonia-oxidizers under turf and ruderal land-use likely also contributes to the previously documented convergence of soil mineral N pools. We also found a higher relative abundance of methanogens (amplicon sequencing), a higher relative abundance of gene sequences putatively identified as Ni-Fe hydrogenase and nickel uptake (shotgun metagenomics) under urban land-use; and a convergence of gene sequences putatively identified as contributing to the nickel transport function under urban turf sites. High levels of disturbance lead to a higher relative abundance of gene sequences putatively identified as multiple antibiotic resistance protein marA and multidrug efflux pump mexD, but did not lead to an overall convergence in antibiotic resistance gene sequences.

AB  - North Fennoscandian mountain forests are distributed along the Scandes Mountains between Sweden and Norway, and the low-mountain regions of northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the adjacent northwestern Russia. Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency, as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often referred to as "Europe's last wilderness", even if human influence of varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia. However, the current rapid change in climate is predicted to profoundly affect the ecology and dynamics of these forests in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ecological impact assessment scheme that has been developed to classify alien species in Norway is presented. The underlying set of criteria enables a generic and semi-quantitative impact assessment of alien species. The criteria produce a classification of alien species that is testable, transparent and easily adjustable to novel evidence or environmental change. This gives a high scientific and political legitimacy to the end product and enables an effective prioritization of management efforts, while at the same time paying attention to the precautionary principle. The criteria chosen are applicable to all species regardless of taxonomic position. This makes the assessment scheme comparable to the Red List criteria used to classify threatened species. The impact of alien species is expressed along two independent axes, one measuring invasion potential, the other ecological effects. Using this two-dimensional approach, the categorization captures the ecological impact of alien species, which is the product rather than the sum of spread and effect. Invasion potential is assessed using three criteria, including expected population lifetime and expansion rate. Ecological effects are evaluated using six criteria, including interactions with native species, changes in landscape types, and the potential to transmit genes or parasites. Effects on threatened species or landscape types receive greater weightings.

AB  - We examine human-animal encounters as the generative source of affective knowing and learning to study the role of affect in the implementation of nature conservation. The study is based on an ethnographic approach following the embodied practices of biological field surveyors working with Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) in land use planning in Finland. The case is characterized by radical uncertainties due to the elusive life of flying squirrels, the strict conservation standard of the EU, and the pressure of urban development. The surveyors can use only indirect clues to detect these nocturnal animals, but are required to produce accurate and unambiguous ecological knowledge to planners. We found that affective learning enables knowing and increases the reliability of knowledge in such conditions. Affective learning results from alternation between constant encountering of clues and changing intensities that produce feeling states and a sense of the forest where the animals live. Ethical consideration and personal differences are important in affective learning and shape the surveyors as participants in standard development. Finally we discuss the possible implications of affective learning for standard design in nature conservation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We reviewed the ecological characteristics of wood-inhabiting fungi in Malaysia in relation to the major threats to these fungi; we also examined the forest uses that would help to conserve them. Although wood-inhabiting fungi do not show high host specificity or preference in many tropical areas, several are specific to Dipterocarpaceae trees in Malaysia and some species may preferably inhabit other minor tree species. Tree size and decomposition stage are also important determinants of which fungi are present. Among the polypores described by E. J. H. Corner, 41 and 26 species have been recorded only from Malaysian lowland rainforest and montane forest, respectively. Evidence suggests that both of these forest types in Malaysia are home to unique fungal communities. More than 30 polypore species described by Corner are known only from their type localities. These species are likely rare and may be restricted to old-growth forests. Logging decreases species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi because the number of natural treefalls is decreased in logged forests, and the decline of old-growth forests is a major threat to conservation of Malaysian fungi. However, species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi is relatively high in old secondary forests and forests undergoing reduced-impact logging. The diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi is extremely low in oil palm plantations, whereas several species inhabit rubber-tree and acacia plantations. Preservation of old-growth forest is essential for conserving rare wood-inhabiting fungi in Malaysia, but old secondary forests, reduced-impact logged forests, and matured tree plantations may have some importance for the conservation of some species.

AB  - Ensuring sustainable carnivore populations while simultaneously sustaining active and viable pastoral communities often creates conflicts that are difficult to resolve. This article examines how different knowledge systems meet and interact in large carnivore governance in Norway and Sweden. Drawing on a broad range of sources, including observations in meetings, public documents, reports and interviews, in addition to local and national newspaper clippings and internet sites, we study two processes of regional carnivore management (Nordland, Norway and Jamtland, Sweden). We explore how different forms of knowledge have been mobilized, reproduced, transferred and legitimized in policies and regulations in these two processes. Furthermore, we examine the interplay between scientific and experience-based knowledge at different levels and scales in both countries. In Norway, "clear zoning" has been established as a basic management instrument to achieve national "population goals" for carnivores. We show how the locally situated knowledge - in our account represented through the Regional Large Carnivore Committee (RLCC), which includes political parties' and Sami Parliament representatives - experiences real barriers by being overruled by the nationalMinistry of Climate and Environment, 2016in their process of revising the carnivore management plan (CMP). In Sweden where the management of large carnivores is devolved to regional authorities and stakeholder-based Wildlife Management Delegations (WMDs), attempts to regionally solve conflicts are often overthrown by the national environmental protection agency or through court cases initiated by the environmental movement. Hence, compromises that potentially could solve conflicts are undermined. The analysis shows that while carnivore governance in both countries are founded on decentralized management authority at the regional level, local actors struggle for their views, experiences and knowledge to be acknowledged and counted as valid in the management process. While the decentralized management model opens for inclusion of different knowledge systems, this system has yet to acknowledge the challenges of knowledge being dismissed or marginalized across governance levels and scales.

AB  - Green (i.e. vegetated) roofs are an increasingly popular measure to improve climate regulation in residential areas. However, there is limited knowledge on the effect of green roof characteristics (e.g. substrate depth and roof age, size and height), especially in northern climates, on plant species composition of the roofs, even though roof performance is mediated through the plants. We hypothesized that substrate depth and roof age, size and height shape the vegetation on green roofs. We inventoried vegetation on 51 green roofs in the metropolitan area of Helsinki in 2011 and found 230 plant species, of which seven are red-listed. We showed that substrate depth and roof age were predominant in structuring plant communities on green roofs. Thin substrates and young roofs maintained sedum and moss species, while thick substrates and older green roofs supported meadow plants. Roof size and height had variable effects on the vegetation. Our results provide knowledge on the dependence of plant species on roof parameters, which is useful in the planning for particular vegetation on roofs taking into account, e.g. load capacity and substrate depth, the wanted functional properties of the roof, and maintenance.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to examine what factors determine the importance of ecological information in political decision making of urban land use in Helsinki, southern Finland. Results from the interviews of politicians and city officials show that ecological information becomes more important if there are significant conservation values connected to a plan area, contacts and appeals from plan participants, strong media attention or if a decision maker focuses more on the issue due to personal interests and values. Balancing the weight of recreational and cultural values may be one of the most difficult tasks for decision makers to handle.

AB  - A conceptual model is presented as a guide to the maintenance and restoration of ecologically sustainable boreal forest. The model is based on the hypothesis that self-sustained forest ecosystems can be (re-)created, and their biodiversity developed, if forest management can simulate the composition and structure of boreal forest landscapes by introducing and maintaining disturbances leading to naturally dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of forest regeneration.
   The major explanatory variable in the model is the effect of wildfire on sites with different fuel characteristics and climates found in the European boreal forest. Four levels of fire intensity are distinguished, based on mean fire frequencies. These range from extremely low in some wet tall-herb sites or sites at high altitudes or latitudes with a humid climate, where fire is absent or rare, to dry lichen-rich sites where fire occurs often. The model is called ASIO, after the words Absent, Seldom, Infrequent and Often, indicating the four levels.
   Three main disturbance regimes are distinguished in the European boreal forest, based on the complex interactions between probabilistic (e.g. mean fire intervals at different site types) and random events (e.g. where and when a fire occurs): (1) gap-phase Picea abies dynamics; (2) succession from young to old-growth mixed deciduous/coniferous forest; and (3) multi-cohort Pinus sylvestris dynamics. The model stems mainly from studies in Fennoscandia, but some studies from outside this region are reviewed to provide support for a more general application of the model.
   The model has been implemented in planning systems on the landscape level of several large Swedish forest enterprises, and is also used as an educational tool to help private land owners with the location and realization of forest management regimes. Finally, the model can be used to develop an administrative system for the monitoring of biodiversity in boreal forest.

AB  - Halting the loss of biodiversity while providing food security for a growing and prospering world population is a challenge. One possible solution to this dilemma is organic agriculture, which is expected to enhance biodiversity on the farmland. However, organic products often require larger areas. This study demonstrates how we can quantify and compare the direct land use impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional food products such as milk.
   This study assessed direct land use impacts of 1 l of milk leaving the farm gate. Inventory data on land occupation were extracted from a life cycle assessment study of 15 farms in southern Sweden. Direct land use change data were derived from the FAO statistical database. Spatially differentiated characterization factors of occupation (CFOcc) and transformation (CFTrans) were calculated based on the relative difference of plant species richness on agricultural land compared to a (semi) natural regional reference. Data on plant species richness and regeneration times of ecosystems (for calculating transformation impacts) were derived from a literature review. To account for differences in biodiversity value between regions, a weighting system based on absolute species richness, vulnerability and irreplaceability was applied.
   Organic milk had a lower direct land use impact than conventional milk, although it required about double the area. Occupation impacts dominated the results and were much smaller for organic than conventional milk, as CFOcc of organic land uses were considerably smaller. For transformation impacts, differences between the two farming practices were even more pronounced. The highest impacts were caused by soymeal in concentrate feeds (conventional milk) due to large-scale deforestation in its country of cultivation (i.e. Brazil and Argentina). However, lack of reliable data posed a challenge in the assessment of transformation impacts. Overall, results were highly sensitive to differences in land occupation area between farms, the CFOcc and assumptions concerning transformed area. Sensitivity and robustness of results were tested and are discussed.
   Although organic milk required about twice as much land as conventional, it still had lower direct land use impacts on biodiversity. This highlights the importance of assessing land use impacts not only based on area but also considering the actual impacts on biodiversity. The presented approach allows to quantify and compare hot- and coldspots in the agricultural stage of milk production and could potentially also be applied to other agricultural products. However, more research is needed to allow quantification of indirect land use impacts.

AB  - It has been suggested that biodiversity in agroecosystems depends on both landscape heterogeneity and farm management, but at the same time, studies of biodiversity in relation to both landscape variables and farm management are rare. We investigated the species richness of plants, butterflies, carabids, rove beetles and the diversity of spiders in cereal fields, leys (grass and clover crop) and semi-natural pastures at 16 farms in Central East Sweden. The farms were divided into eight pairs of one conventional and one organic farm to enable us to separate the effects of landscape and farm management on biodiversity. The pairing was based on land use, location, and landscape features. Species richness of different taxonomic groups was generally not correlated. There were no differences in species richness between the farming systems, except for carabids that had higher numbers of species on conventional farms. The species richness generally increased with landscape heterogeneity on a farm scale. Habitat type had a major effect on the species richness for most groups, with most species found in pastures and leys. The correlations between species richness and landscape variables on a farm scale, and not on a scale of multiple farms, identify farmers as the important decision-maker in conservation issues for these taxonomic groups. We discuss the role of species richness of pests' natural enemies for biological control and conservation strategies of the more common species in the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Context Functional connectivity is vital for plant species dispersal, but little is known about how habitat loss and the presence of green infrastructure interact to affect both functional and structural connectivity, and the impacts of each on species groups. Objectives We investigate how changes in the spatial configuration of species-rich grasslands and related green infrastructure such as road verges, hedgerows and forest borders in three European countries have influenced landscape connectivity, and the effects on grassland plant biodiversity. Methods We mapped past and present land use for 36 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden, to estimate connectivity based on simple habitat spatial configuration (structural connectivity) and accounting for effective dispersal and establishment (functional connectivity) around focal grasslands. We used the resulting measures of landscape change to interpret patterns in plant communities. Results Increased presence of landscape connecting elements could not compensate for large scale losses of grassland area resulting in substantial declines in structural and functional connectivity. Generalist species were negatively affected by connectivity, and responded most strongly to structural connectivity, while functional connectivity determined the occurrence of grassland specialists in focal grasslands. Restored patches had more generalist species, and a lower density of grassland specialist species than ancient patches. Conclusions Protecting both species rich grasslands and dispersal pathways within landscapes is essential for maintaining grassland biodiversity. Our results show that increases in green infrastructure have not been sufficient to offset loss of semi-natural habitat, and that landscape links must be functionally effective in order to contribute to grassland diversity.

AB  - ContextHabitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity. It can create temporal lags in decline of species in relation to destruction of habitat coverage. Plant species specialized in semi-natural grasslands, especially meadows, often express such extinction debt.ObjectivesWe studied habitat loss and fragmentation of meadows and examined whether the changes in meadow coverage had caused an extinction debt on vascular plants. We also studied whether historical or present landscape patterns or contemporary environmental factors were more important determinants of species occurrence.MethodsWe surveyed the plant species assemblages of 12 grazed and 12 mown meadows in Central Finland and detected the meadow coverages from their surroundings on two spatial scales and on three time steps. We modelled the effects of functional connectivity, habitat amount, and isolation on species richness and community composition.ResultsWe observed drastic and dynamic meadow loss in landscapes surrounding our study sites during the last 150years. However, we did not find explicit evidence for an extinction debt in meadow plants. The observed species richness correlated with contemporary factors, whereas both contemporary factors and habitat availability during the 1960s affected community composition.ConclusionsEffective conservation management of meadow biodiversity builds on accurate understanding of the relative importance of past and present factors on species assemblages. Both mown and grazed meadows with high species richness need to be managed in the future. The management effort should preferably be targeted to sites located near to each other.

AB  - Deer (Cervidae) cause considerable damage to forest plantations, crops, and protected habitats. The most common response to this damage is to implement strategies to lower population densities. However, lowering deer density may not always be desirable from hunting, recreational, or conservation perspectives. Therefore, knowledge is needed about additional factors beyond deer density that affect damage levels, and management actions that consider competing management goals. We studied the relationships between levels of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (1) relative deer density indices (pellet group count and deer harvest data), (2) availability of alternative natural forage (cover of forage species) and (3) proportion forest in the landscape, both at a forest stand scale and at a landscape scale. Extensive variation in damage level was evident between the six study areas. On a stand scale, the proportion of spruce damaged was positively related to pellet group density, indicating the importance of local deer usage of stands. In addition, available alternative forage in the field layer within spruce stands and proportion forest surrounding stands was negatively related to damage level. On the landscape scale, damage level was negatively related to availability of forage in the field and shrub layers and proportion forest, but was not related to any of the relative deer density indices. Increasing alternative forage may thus decrease damage and thereby reduce conflicts. Additionally, the proportion of forest in the landscape affects damage levels and should thus be considered in landscape planning and when forecasting damage risk. The relationship between local deer usage of stands and damage level suggests that future studies should try to separate the effects of local deer usage and deer density.

AB  - P>Salmon, Salmo salar L., fishing involves a broad range of interest groups and is thus a challenge for fisheries governance. This article focuses on the natural River Tornionjoki between Finland and Sweden, the most important wild salmon river in the Northern Baltic Sea. The marine salmon fisheries have been restricted to protect the declining wild salmon stocks and secure catches for fishing tourism. River fisheries interest groups have been absent from the salmon committees, but have taken other measures to influence salmon fisheries politics. This social movement has achieved its aims only partly, because of counteractions by the coastal commercial fishers and their associations. A forum for enabling dialogue between stakeholders is recommended to reduce tensions between the commercial fishery and tourism industry.

AB  - An essential component of many forest certification schemes is that landowners should voluntarily set aside a proportion of their forestland with the main aim of promoting biodiversity. However, the influence on biodiversity of such conservation areas is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the area extent, structural diversity of importance to biodiversity and stand characteristics between voluntary set asides (VSA(1)) established through certification, formally state-protected nature reserves (R-2) and managed production forests (PF3). We used data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory and focused on forestry company land in boreal Sweden, amounting to about 7 million ha. VSA and R were found to cover approximately the same area (0.6 million ha each) but VSA were more numerous, especially for sizes <10 ha, whereas most areas >10,000 ha belonged to R. VSA also occurred in more southerly locations. VSA were intermediate between R and PF regarding dead wood volume, number of large diameter trees ha(-1) and value of a composite structural index. VSA had significantly higher volumes of the important broadleaved trees species aspen, rowan and sallow, VSA and R were much older and had lower site productivity than PF, but VSA had higher total standing volumes. Our analysis showed that certified-driven VSA are an important complement to traditional reserves regarding size and structural factors important to biodiversity. Thus, future development of planning models should consider both types of set-asides and their spatial configuration. This will require integration of non-state and state governance processes.

AB  - Protecting biodiversity requires the practice of making nature values present in natural resource use decisions. In this article, such practices are explored from the perspective of affective capacities for expert fieldwork in forestry. Affective capacities are broadly acknowledged in the literature on embodied knowing, and by the practitioners themselves, as a necessary condition for knowing nature. We will extend this discussion to the politics involved. Drawing on a case study in Finland, the article points out that professional foresters' affective ways of knowing nature are controlled by institutionalised strategies and practices. Thus, power is exercised through fieldwork, determining how nature can and should be known in forestry. The article concludes that since policy implementation takes place through the intensities present in mundane routines, governance studies would benefit from understanding how the various technologies of governance interact with emergent and embodied capacities.

AB  - European lobster Homarus gammarus in Norway has been in decline over the last 30 to 40 yr, and the species is currently red listed according to International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria. In 2006, experimental lobster reserves were established in the coastal Skagerrak, southern Norway, allowing for studies in the absence of disturbance by fishing gear. We present behavioural data from individual lobsters (n = 10) within 2 of the reserves. These data were obtained from data storage tags which logged in situ temperature and depth of specific individuals for up to 1 yr. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first direct measurements of depth obtained from freely behaving lobsters. Net movement exhibited by recaptured lobsters, measured as the distance between global positioning system positions recorded at the site of capture and recapture ranged from 15 to 580 m. Lobsters used habitats within a depth range of 1 to 57 m, and experienced sea temperatures ranging from 2 degrees C during late winter (February to March) to 18 degrees C during late summer (August to September). Lobster activity levels declined from September, reaching a minimum during February and March. From April, activity levels resumed. Seasonal variation in activity was correlated to water temperature (r(2) = 0.55). Lobsters were more active during nighttime than during daytime, and there was a tendency for lobsters to reside in more shallow water during nighttime versus daytime. The present study suggests that future reserves for European lobster should be designed to include deeper habitat (30 to 50 m) in areas where such habitat exists when the management objective is long-term protection.

AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide and one of the major causes of such decline is habitat loss. Forestry practices have a primary role in causing habitat loss and fragmentation, detrimental to amphibians. We studied the ecological requirements of a fully terrestrial and threatened amphibian, the Golden Alpine Salamander Salamandra atra aurorae, which is endemic to a small portion of the Italian Alps. This rare and elusive salamander lives exclusively in forest environments and forestry practices are considered among its major threats. We employed both a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and an occupancy approach in fifty 400 m(2) plots, within a managed mixed forest dominated by Norway spruce and to a lesser extent beech, and silver fir. Modelling salamander occupancy as a function of site-specific habitat features allowed us to understand the ecological requirements of this salamander and provide precise guidelines for forest management. The application of hierarchical models (occupancy) for evaluating forest management plans is highly effective, requires less effort and is a less impacting methodology than CMR performed by searching for salamanders under shelters also in non-optimal weather conditions. Distance from open pasture edges significantly affects the distribution of salamanders while, at a smaller scale, brushwood piles, classified as fine woody debris (FWD, diameter from 1 to 10 cm), play a key role in providing suitable habitat for this endangered amphibian. The importance of FWD in the conservation of small vertebrates is generally poorly studied and probably underestimated. However, our results show that FWD should be considered as an additional element that has to be managed to enhance habitat suitability for this and, intuitively, for other small forest vertebrates.

AB  - This paper examines the socially optimal drainage choice (surface/subsurface) for agricultural crop cultivation in a landscape with different land qualities (fertilities) when private profits and nutrient runoff damages are taken into account. We also study the measurable social costs to increase biodiversity by surface drainage when the locations of the surface-drained areas in a landscape affect the provided biodiversity. We develop a general theoretical model and apply it to empirical data from Finnish agriculture. We find that for low land qualities the measurable social returns are higher to surface drainage than to subsurface drainage, and that the profitability of subsurface drainage increases along with land quality. The measurable social costs to increase biodiversity by surface drainage under low land qualities are negative. For higher land qualities, these costs depend on the land quality and on the biodiversity impacts. Biodiversity conservation plans for agricultural landscapes should focus on supporting surface drainage systems in areas where the measurable social costs to increase biodiversity are negative or lowest.

AB  - The European Landscape Convention is the first international agreement to deal with all aspects of landscape planning, protection, and management. It emphasizes transparency, democracy, and good governance as integral parts of 'landscape'. The ELC may inspire member states of the Council of Europe to develop better tools for planning land use and the environment; however its utility in practice is still largely untested. This article considers the relevance of the ELC to a major land use conflict in Europe today: the development of wind power. Two countries are used as case studies of this conflict. Italy and Sweden both contain iconic European landscapes, and both have become important sites of large-scale wind power development over the last decade. But the two countries also have divergent political, economic, and institutional traditions. The debate around wind power and landscape has therefore unfolded differently in the two countries. The article consists of three parts. The first part gives an overview of the growth in wind power, and the forms that opposition to wind power have taken, in Italy over the past decade. It is argued that implementation of the ELC's clauses on democratic, locally-based landscape planning process will encounter in Italy a major impediment in the form of political and economic corruption. The second part summarizes the development of wind power as part of the Swedish national energy strategy. Using a case study of a wind power planning process guided by the ELC, it is argued that what appear to be common landscape values in local communities often conceal fundamental conflicts among individuals, groups, and institutions. On the basis of these two cases, the third and concluding part sketches both the potential of the ELC to transform the planning process for wind power, and the real challenges it will face, as a non-binding, 'global' agreement, in 'local' places with their own histories, traditions, and social actors.

AB  - In a comparative study we investigated woodpecker abundance in forest landscapes with different proportion of native pine forest and spruce plantations in western Norway. In 100 circular study plots of 100 ha each we recorded 38 white- backed - Dendrocopos leucotos, 22 grey- headed - Picus canus, 13 great spotted - Dendrocopos major, 6 green - Picus viridis, and 2 lesser spotted - Dendrocopos minor woodpeckers in the breeding season. The mean number of recorded woodpecker species peaked at 20 - 40% spruce plantations. The two most common species in the study, the white- backed and the grey- headed woodpeckers are both Red-listed species in Norway and among the rarest woodpeckers in Europe. The white- backed woodpecker preferred plots with higher than average proportions of standing dead trees and deciduous trees, and low proportions of spruce plantations in the plots. The grey-headed woodpecker preferred plots in the western ( coastal) parts of the study area with presence of large aspen Populus tremula trees. Logistic regression models did not reveal any clear threshold values with respect to proportion of spruce plantations in plots, although both woodpecker species were extremely rare in plots with > 60% spruce plantations. We recommend spruce plantations to be kept at moderate levels to ensure viable populations of woodpeckers in western Norway.

AB  - Riparian buffers are the primary tool in forest management for protecting the habitat structure and function of streams. They help protect against biogeochemical perturbation, filter sediments and nutrients, prevent erosion, contribute food to aquatic organisms, regulate light and hence water temperature, contribute deadwood, and preserve biodiversity. However, in production forests of Sweden and Finland, many headwater streams have been straightened, ditched, and/or channelized, resulting in altered hydrology and reduced natural disturbance by floods, which in turn affects important riparian functions. Furthermore, in even-aged management systems as practiced in much of Fennoscandia, understory trees have usually been cleared right up to the stream's edge during thinning operations, especially around small, headwater streams. Fire suppression has further favored succession towards shade tolerant species. In the regions within Fennoscandia that have experienced this combination of intensive management and lack of natural disturbance, riparian zones are now dominated by single-storied, native Norway spruce. When the adjacent forest is cut, thin (5 - 15m) conifer-dominated riparian buffers are typically left. These buffers do not provide the protection and subsidies, in terms of leaf litter quality, needed to maintain water quality or support riparian or aquatic biodiversity. Based on a literature review, we found compelling evidence that the ecological benefits of multi-layered, mixed-species riparian forest with a large component of broadleaved species are higher than what is now commonly found in the managed stands of Fennoscandia. To improve the functionality of riparian zones, and hence the protection of streams in managed forest landscapes, we present some basic principles that could be used to enhance the ecological function of these interfaces. These management actions should be prioritized on streams and streamside stands that have been affected by simplification either through forest management or hydrological modification. Key to these principles is the planning and managing of buffer zones as early as possible in the rotation to ensure improved function throughout the rotation cycle and not only at final felling. This is well in line with EU and national legislation which can be interpreted as requiring landscape planning at all forest ages to meet biodiversity and other environmental goals. However, it is still rare that planning for conservation is done other than at the final felling stage. Implementing this new strategy is likely to have long-term positive effects and improve the protection of surface waters from negative forestry effects and a history of fire suppression. By following these suggested management principles, there will be a longer time period with high function and greater future management flexibility in addition to the benefits provided by leaving riparian buffers at the final felling stage.

AB  - Aim Grasslands of varying land-use intensity and history were studied to describe and test species richness and compositional patterns and their relationships with the physical environment, land cover of the surrounding landscape, patch geometry, and grazing. Location The mainland of Norway. Methods We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness. The importance of land use and land-cover composition should be considered when planning management actions in extensively used high-latitude grasslands.

AB  - Serious concerns exist about potentially reinforcing negative effects of climate change and land conversion on biodiversity. Here, we investigate the tandem and interacting roles of climate warming and land-use change as predictors of shifts in the regional distributions of 1701 plant species in Sweden over 60 years. We show that species associated with warmer climates have increased, while grassland specialists have declined. Our results also support the hypothesis that climate warming and vegetation densification through grazing abandonment have synergistic effects on species distribution change. Local extinctions were related to high levels of warming but were reduced by grassland retention. In contrast, colonisations occurred more often in areas experiencing high levels of both climate and land-use change. Strong temperature increases were experienced by species across their ranges, indicating time lags in expected warming-related local extinctions. Our results highlight that the conservation of threatened species relies on both reduced green-house gas emissions and the retention and restoration of valuable habitat.

AB  - In Sweden forest owners have a high degree of freedom in management decisions, but that does not necessarily imply decisions in isolation. Landowners are often influenced by forestry advisors, shaping forest management practices and the resulting condition of forests. As the State is withdrawing resources from the Swedish Forest Agency, advisory services are widely provided by private actors, particularly timber buyers. This study applies Ha center dot gerstrand's framework of nested domains to explore the role of timber buyers, with emphasis on their spatial competence. We expand Ha center dot gerstrand's theory by integrating private domains, which play an important role in landscape governance. Semi-structured interviews reveal the dynamics of timber buyers' dual role. Despite access to extensive data when giving advice, timber buyers rely largely on personal experience and information at the stand and property level, and environmental data are largely overshadowed by data related to timber production. Despite the buyers' greater spatial competence in comparison to landowners, they lack incentives to actively apply a landscape perspective in forest planning and management. There is underutilised potential for effectively balancing timber production, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation at the landscape level through the advisory services by private actors. Our operationalized framework is helpful in analyzing FOKIS in Sweden, where compatibility of different types of advice providers needs further attention.

AB  - During the last centuries, land use in Europe intensified, which has led to a drastic decrease in the cover of semi-natural grasslands. In Sweden, much of the lost grasslands was turned into forest. This study investigated if species typical of managed grasslands could be found in coniferous production forests more than 80 years after grassland management ceased. Species and trait composition for plants was investigated in two types of forest differing in land use history (meadow in the 1870s or continuous coniferous forest), and in reference grasslands. The average plant species richness as well as the richness of grassland indicator species were 30% higher in forests with a history as meadow compared to in forests with a history as forest, hence clear signs of historical grassland management in today's forests. Compared with forests with continuous coniferous history, vegetation in forests with a meadow history tended to be more similar to reference grassland regarding both plant species and especially plant trait composition. The study provides proof of remnant grassland populations in coniferous production as the source for the biodiversity of clearcuts, rather than seed dispersal or seed bank survival. The result highlights the importance of land use for biodiversity of clearcuts, and points to the potential value of forests with a history of meadow in grassland conservation and restoration.

AB  - Biodiversity offsetting is a highly debated topic in biodiversity governance. On the one hand, offsetting provides a promising new conservation tool that can make the loss of ecological values visible and increasing conservation funding. On the other hand, increased role of market mechanisms and private actors poses a risk of commodi-fying nature or failing to meet the ecological outcome. Thus, offsetting can also be considered as an ethically problematic shift in nature conservation. Despite such controversies, biodiversity offsetting is an increasingly important biodiversity policy instrument globally. There is considerable variation in the types of offsetting policies adopted in different countries. However, the political debates related to offsetting policymaking have rarely been analyzed. To gain a more nuanced understanding on how these controversies can influence the adoption and formulation of offsetting policies, we analyzed the formal introduction of biodiversity offsetting policy in the Nature Conservation Act in Finland. We applied frame analysis on the statements issued during the public hearing process to understand how stakeholders, public administration and active citizens perceive biodiversity offsetting. We identified four frames promoting varying implementation of the offsetting system. All the frames indicated that biodiversity offsetting was generally a welcomed addition to Finnish biodiversity policy. However, the frames were contradictory regarding the goal of offsetting, the level of regulation and the role of authorities and markets in their implementation, which can result in varying conservation outcomes. The debate resulted in slight emphasis of the pro-business perspective. A voluntary offsetting system was adopted.

AB  - Aim The rate of climate change might exceed the migration capacity of plants, particularly where habitats became fragmented by human land use. Except for some tree species, the extent to which habitat fragmentation decreases migration rates has nevertheless been little evaluated. Here, we compare simulated migration rates of understorey herbs, which comprise the big part of temperate forest plant diversity, under varying levels of fragmentation at a continental scale.
   Location Europe.
   Methods We combined simulations of demography and seed dispersal to simulate migration of 16 hypothetical forest herb species through a virtual, continuously forested landscape of 50x50km and through 1179 50x50km regions spanning most of the European Union's territory plus Norway and Switzerland. Each region was subdivided into a 250-m raster of sites, which were rated as suitable to a species if covered by forest according to current land cover maps and future land cover scenarios. The 16 hypothetical species were defined by combinations of those trait values that control demographic and dispersal processes.
   Results In continuous forests, simulated migration rates of the 16 species varied between similar to 95 and similar to 225m/y. Current forest fragmentation was predicted to reduce migration rates to about 70% on average across the continent, but to below 25% in many parts of western and southern Europe. Under future land use, migration rates might slightly increase in economically marginal regions.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that even on a continuously forested continent most understorey herbs would be unable to track climate warming and that habitat fragmentation will reduce migration rates to values an order of magnitude lower than expected climate velocities in parts of Europe. We conclude that, instead of concentrating conservation efforts in protected areas, facilitating the movement of species through the average countryside should become a conservation priority.

AB  - In many marine species, large females tend to produce more robust offspring than small females. However, knowledge on maternal influences in decapod crustaceans is limited. This is unfortunate since many decapod populations are being intensively harvested and show signs of 'juvenescence', i.e. the loss of large (and presumably old) individuals. In this study, we quantified maternal influences in European lobster Homarus gammarus from Skagerrak, southern Norway. Historical lobster catches in Skagerrak were substantial but the stock has suffered a major decline over the past 30 to 40 yr and is currently red listed as near threatened according to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) criteria. We studied eggs and larvae from wild-caught ovigerous females ranging in carapace length from 79 to 152 mm (n = 45). Mean egg size increased while sibling size variation decreased significantly with increasing maternal size. Mean larval size at hatching was closely linked to both maternal size and mean egg size. A laboratory experiment showed a weak but significant nonlinear increase in pelagic larval survival with increasing mean egg size in the absence of food. These findings suggest that maternal influences on offspring quality could be a significant source of variation in lobster recruitment. Consequently, maternal influences could be an important source of error in fisheries science and management if they are assumed to be absent or unimportant.

AB  - Farmland biodiversity continues to decline because changes in modern agriculture have led to the degradation and loss of key habitats. One farmland habitat that has received little attention during development of conservation measures is farmsteads. We use bird count data from a survey conducted at over 600 sites in 3725 km(2) agricultural landscapes in southern Sweden to investigate the importance of farmsteads as potential sources of biodiversity in simplified landscapes. We found that farmsteads, on average, had more bird species and individuals than semi-natural pastures and infield infield non-crop islands, probably due to a larger area of non-field habitats at farmstead sites. Presence of farm animals was an important predictor of bird diversity and numbers at farmsteads while variables associated with arable land-use intensification had limited effect. Old farmsteads with no current active farming, on average, had low bird numbers. We found no effect of agricultural intensification at the landscape level on alpha diversity at farmstead sites. Rather, species richness and abundance of birds tended to increase as landscapes became characterized by more intensive agriculture with larger fields. Farmsteads are widespread in simplified agricultural landscapes and may provide habitat to a range of farmland species. Applying conservation measures to farmsteads and local surroundings that increase the availability of safe nest-sites and good foraging grounds for birds could be implemented through publicity driven schemes. This combined with other agri-environment schemes in the surrounding landscape could enhance the amount of critical resources for farmland birds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is political interest in Sweden's proximity to Norway, which is reflected in the regional policy focusing on developing business needs. As such, proximity at the regional level is simply expected to generate economic growth. The authors propose a holistic approach to spatial planning in a Swedish-Norwegian border region in place of the simplistic economic perspective. The aim of the article is to highlight the importance of adopting a bottom-up cross-border planning perspective that is based on the perceptions of the border region residents by showing that the proximity of Norway is important to communities in Varmland Province, on the border with Norway, in a different way from how regional authorities and policymakers perceive it. The authors used a qualitative method in their study. They found that residents were more interested in the individual, social, and cultural opportunities of the border, while authorities stressed traditional growth strategies. In conclusion, the authors recommend that policymakers should implement a bottom-up cross-border planning strategy (CBPS) in Varmland that includes the residents' perspective, as a reinforcement of place-based policy approaches.

AB  - Introduction. The tiny mossMicrohypnum sauteriis widely distributed in Europe being recorded from 14 countries, but it seems to be relatively uncommon everywhere and is on the Red List in seven of these countries. The sites in Norway are the closest populations to this new find in Scotland. Methods.A specimen was collected during a visit to Assynt in West Sutherland in April 2019, during a survey of populations ofAmblyodon dealbatusandEncalypta alpina, and subsequently identified asMicrohypnum sauteri. Results.Micrcohypnum sauteriis reported from the limestone at Inchnadamph in West Sutherland, new to the British flora. The species and its habitat are described and comments made on its ecology and European distribution. Conclusions.The site whereMicrcohypnum sauteriwas found has a number of other montane calcicole species andM. sauteriis most likely to be native here. Given its small size and the fact that it has been overlooked at such a well-known site, it seems quite possible that it could occur on calcareous rocks in the mountains elsewhere in Scotland, some other possible locations being the high limestone in the Alder Forest and in the Glenshee area and perhaps on the calcareous schist on Ben Lawers.

AB  - Constructed wetlands, have been used to decrease nitrogen transport from agricultural catchments to the coast of Sweden, while simultaneously contributing to increased species richness in the landscape. The purpose of this paper is to compile and evaluate data that have been produced in Sweden during some 20 years of using constructed wetlands as an environmental tool. To evaluate effects of different stated objectives for constructed wetlands within different national support systems we focus on nitrogen removal and bird and amphibian species richness. Continuous automatic water sampling for nitrogen removal measurements, during 1.5 to 10 years, has been performed in 7 constructed wetlands located in agricultural catchments in southern Sweden. Nitrogen removal per wetland area varied between wetlands but the results imply that an annual removal of at least 1000 kg N per ha wetland area can be achieved in individual wetlands. Data from the long-term monitoring of the 7 wetlands, together with nitrogen removal data in the literature, were used to model >150 randomly selected constructed wetlands. According to the modeling, the nitrogen removal per created wetland area varied markedly between different wetland creation programs and was generally considerably lower compared to what can be achieved in individual wetlands. Cost-efficiency of nitrogen removal in wetland creation programs can be increased considerably with improved planning and if other desired benefits (e.g. species richness) contribute to share the costs for wetland creation.
   The effects of constructed wetlands in Sweden on species number and populations of wetland birds and amphibians were large enough to positively affect the occurrence of species in the national red list, i.e. on a national population level. Species richness of wetland breeding birds in the constructed wetlands were relatively stable after 13 years, but different functional groups had very different succession pattern. The mean maximum breeding bird species number in the wetlands occurred after 3.8 years.
   Wetland birds and amphibians colonized constructed wetlands irrespective of the original objective of the wetland (nitrogen removal or biodiversity). However, some amphibian species showed preference for biodiversity wetlands. There were clear effects of wetland construction on the regional populations of non-wetland bird species. The maximum species number for a given wetland size was found to be higher than previously reported.
   The analyses show that wetland construction can be a cost effective method for decreasing transport of diffuse pollution from arable land, and that the wetlands are important for the species numbers and population sizes on all spatial scales. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article the distribution and intensity of cross-border cooperation (CBC) networks are tested with primary survey and interview data collected from the Finnish-Russian cross-border region. The study concentrates on the cross-border connectivity of three regionally significant and interlocking sectors (forest, mining and tourism industries together with associated research and administrative organisations) with varying strategies towards natural resource use. The collected data were examined by applying social network analysis tools developed for cross-border contexts. The results depict varying landscapes of CBC depending on the type (firms, research and administrative organisations) of the surveyed actors. Overall the studied CBC network is weakly developed with low firm-level participation and low integration between the sectors - a weakness in the sustainable utilisation of natural resources. Local administrative and research organisations are the network hubs in the studied cross-border region. As apositive note, the CBC network is not solely reliant on these few network hubs but also consists of several moderately connected cross-border actors that increase its robustness against cross-border network failures. The emergence of new and the deepening of the existing cross-border links between the industries would be pivotal for good policy design regarding local land-use and natural resource use policies.

AB  - Stumps comprise up to 80% of the residual deadwood following clear cutting and are a significant source of biomass for bioenergetic applications. However, stump harvesting may pose significant conservation risks for saproxylic organisms that occur in residual deadwood. To define retention targets for stump harvesting operations, we compared abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles within individual stumps as well as species accumulation curves in replicated pairs of clear cuts with and without stump harvesting in northern Sweden. Using 20 stands, we sampled 1049 stumps using eclector traps and collected 9821 beetles representing 253 species with known saproxylic biology. Nineteen of these species were red-listed in Sweden. We hypothesized that individual stumps left following stump harvesting would contain higher densities and species richness than in clear cuts without stump removal due to crowding of beetles into increasingly limited habitats. However, we found no difference in density or richness within individual stumps between control clear cuts and stumped stands. We also compared species richness between control and stumped treatments using rarefaction within individual stands and across all stands and found no difference. As with density and richness, beetle composition at the stand-level did not differ between control and stumped stands. Thus, the density of surrounding stumps within a stand had very little effect on beetle assemblages in residual stumps. We estimated the effect of stump harvest on species richness at the stand level by combining all samples and extrapolating a rarefaction curve derived from the landscape-level species pool to an accumulated sample volume of 48 m(3) which corresponds to the total volume of stumps on average-sized clear cuts in Northern Sweden. Using this curve, we compared differences in species richness in average-sized clear cuts with 100% (48 m(3)) and 25% (12 m(3)) stump retention and found that stump harvest resulted in a 26% (95% C.I. 7-41%) loss of species. While the absolute scaling of the landscape-derived rarefaction does not reflect species loss at the stand-level because the combined curve reflects all rare species in the landscape, the relative species loss derived from this curve may serve as credible benchmark for species loss at the stand level following current stump harvesting practices. This benchmark may be further calibrated with additional information on number of singleton species and estimates of maximum species richness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet conservation goals it is necessary to assess vegetation status and to be able to monitor effects of management and environmental change. In northern Europe grazed grasslands are one of the most threatened habitat in the rural landscape and thus in focus for conservation plans. At present managers use species indicator list to assess past and present management status of grassland and succession stages in particular, as well as effects of the environment. However, these indicators have rarely been scientifically tested.
   In this study we discuss if plant functional traits may be a key to select suitable indicator species for monitoring land-use change in Swedish rural landscape. The suitability of two possible monitoring tools: (i) plant species selected from functional traits (PFTs) and (ii) indicator species commonly used today to assess grassland management status, were tested along two gradients, a succession gradient and a wetness gradient. We found no association between successional change and plant functional traits, but a response in plant functional traits was found along the wetness gradient. However, the more common "non-scientific" indicator species responded fairly well to the varying gradient categories along both gradients. We believe that there is a need to further validate the ecological mechanisms behind the present-day indicators and to place them in a geographical context. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper aims to provide an overview of experience for Sustainable water management in Norway. It covers professional areas of integrated water management including urban stormwater management, hydropower development and environment protection, hydrological data collection and flood control, soil erosion and control measures from agricultural areas, ecosystem conservation in river catchments and sediment transportation, and the long - term development of climate change. Water management should be systematic and predictable, and based on the principle of legality. Selected central acts regulating water management aspects, important regulations including regulations oil drinking water, sewage purification, licence fees, safety and supervision of watercourse installations were reviewed. The recognition of the economic value of water is visible in many parts of Norwegian water legislation. Several aspects of urban stormwater management, as a whole of integrated water management, were highlighted in part I of the paper. Hydropower development related regulations concerning on environment protection were described in part 2. Floods caused by typical climate in Nor-way, structural and non - structural measures to mitigate floods were summarised in part 3. Erosion from agricultural areas, control measure, monitoring system were summarised in part 4. Research regarding erosion process in river catchments, glacial erosion, and erosion in clay areas, mountain and arctic rivers, and sediment transportation in rivers were presented in part 5. Climate development in Norway during 1900 similar to 2100 was given in the last part of the paper, where regional climate downscale models, empirical and dynamical downscaling, were introduced. Results of climate variation - temperature and precipitation in Norway in the latest 100 similar to 150 years and scenarios of climate development during the 21st century were presented.

AB  - Compliance with the Water Framework Directive (WFD) will require substantial reductions in agricultural phosphorus (P) losses in the Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Falling P surpluses in agriculture for more than a decade and voluntary programmes of good agricultural practice have not reduced P losses to surface waters, while general. regulatory measures have primarily focused on nitrogen. Without addressing the role of critical source areas for P loss, policy measures to abate diffuse P losses are likely to be ineffective. This has created a demand by environmental authorities for instruments that assess the risk of P losses from agricultural land and facilitate the planning of mitigation measures. In Nordic countries index-type risk assessment tools for diffuse P tosses are under development inspired by experiences with P indexing in the USA. A common feature is that they are empirical, risk-based, user-friendly decision toots with tow data requirements. Phosphorus indices vary between the four Nordic countries in response to different agriculture, soil and climate. These differences also result in different recent average annual agricultural P toad estimates to the sea of 0.3, 0.5, 0.5 and 1.1 kg total P ha(-1) in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, respectively. In initial evaluations, Nordic P indices explained a large degree of variance in P losses at the field or catchment scale, but comparative data are still limited. To gain acceptance amongst stakeholders and inform river basin management planning in Nordic catchments as part of the WFD, it is crucial to more thoroughly evaluate the performance of these indices' at the field and catchment scale.

AB  - Cost-effective conservation strategies are needed because resources for nature conservation are often limited. When areas of high biodiversity value rest on private land, voluntary participation of landowners to conservation should be sought. Voluntary programs are still rarely implemented and evaluated in their effectiveness in achieving conservation targets. From 2000 onwards, a conservation program was conducted to preserve raptor nests from forest clear-cutting in private lands of North Karelia (Finland). Landowners were proposed to voluntarily set aside a forest buffer around nests of Accipiter gentilis, Buteo buteo and Pernis apivorus on their land. Participation was based on self-motivation, with no incentive involved. Participation to the program was extremely high (97% of 327 approached landowners during 20022006 joined). This positive attitude reduced nest losses as a result of forestry from 54% in the 1990s (n?=?327 known nests) to only 2% since the start of the program (n?=?519 nests). The voluntary action proved effective as a before-after-control-impact analysis showed that low-buffered nests (which had clear-cutting within 100?m; n?=?48) had similar occupancy as high-buffered nests (no clear-cutting within 100?m; n?=?144). Occupancy, however, decreased with shorter distance to the clear-cut within the 100?m radius, and thus as wide a buffer as possible is recommended to retain occupancy of a nest site. We conclude that voluntary-based approaches can be useful for cost-effective conservation and they should be considered more often in conservation practice.

AB  - Climate change mitigation is a global response that requires actions at the local level. Quantifying local sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG) facilitate evaluating mitigation options. We present an approach to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape, to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region. Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland. Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the region (66%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total emissions of the region by 72%. The region's net emissions amounted to 4.37 +/- 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr(-1), corresponding to a net emission intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km(-2) yr(-1), and estimated per capita net emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr(-1). Our landscape approach opens opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions.

AB  - Contemporary European agriculture has a number of additional aims beside of food production, such as safeguarding environmental services and conservation values. Substantial efforts at official levels are aimed towards sustainable development but also towards maintaining values of what may be termed vanishing landscapes. Selected areas and landscape features are set aside for protection or restoration. Individual efforts of this type have a long history in Sweden, and the issue has recently received increased attention, primarily due to more ambitious government goals concerning biodiversity conservation and Sweden's ratification of the European Landscape Convention. This has resulted in an increased scientific and official interest in vanishing values in the rural landscape, where parts of Eastern Europe, such as the Maramures district in Romania, have been used as model examples of land use regimes which in the past was common in Sweden. In this context, the dilemma of romanticizing peasants' use of land is highlighted and discussed more than has hitherto been done. This paper sheds light on some paradoxes inherent in official policies in relation to land use practices concerning the management of rural landscapes in Sweden, and relates the Swedish situation to a contrasting example of landscape practice in Romania. We discuss the concept of landscape care in relation to the construction and perception of landscape values and valuable landscapes through the lenses of rural realities and official policies. When Swedish authorities engage in the promotion of landscape care, they tend to work with slices of land, specific predefined values and individual farmers, and they often disregard the need to treat the landscape as a socio-ecological complex dynamic in space and time. We discuss how environmental policy generally could be improved through the adoption of a more inclusive and flexible approach towards aiding the different aims inherent in multifunctional rural landscapes.

AB  - In Norway, willow (Lagopus lagopus) and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) populations and harvests have declined during the last few decades, and the 2 species are considered as near threatened on the Norwegian Red List. The Norwegian State-Owned Land and Forest Enterprise (Statskog) is a main provider of ptarmigan hunting on public lands, and has recently introduced harvest restrictions in Nordland County. We investigated the relationship between hunters' opinions and the effects of restrictions on hunters and ptarmigan harvest using online structured questionnaires (2012, n=570) and bag reports (2009-2011, n=8,795). A majority of hunters (66%) supported harvest restrictions, and 89% were willing to shoot fewer birds to increase population size. However, opinions towards specific management alternatives were more negative and disparate. Residency of the hunters (local or non-resident) was the most influential factor on hunter opinions, and this reflected a tendency to approve of restrictions with the smallest effect on their own hunting practice. Our study indicates that access and the opportunity to hunt are more important to hunters than bag size. Daily and annual hunting bags were small, averaging 1.7 and 5.8 ptarmigan, respectively, and the daily bag limit of 4 birds was reached during 5.8% of hunting days. A harvest reduction of 50% implied a daily bag limit of 1 bird and a seasonal bag of 4, which were lower than what hunters found as acceptable. Hence, although hunter opinions may provide useful guidelines for the development of management practices, their opinions need to be evaluated for the actual effects they may have on the game populations.

   We report that although most hunters were positive to ptarmigan hunting restrictions in general, opinions towards specific management alternatives were more negative and disparate. Daily and annual hunting bag limits of only 1 and 4 birds, respectively, would have been needed to obtain a harvest reduction of 50%, and this was far lower than hunters found acceptable.

AB  - Habitat discontinuity, anthropogenic disturbance, and overharvesting have led to population fragmentation and decline worldwide. Preservation of remaining natural genetic diversity is crucial to avoid continued genetic erosion. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is an ideal model species for studying anthropogenic influences on genetic integrity, as it has experienced significant genetic alterations throughout its natural distribution range due to habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, translocations, and stocking. The Pasvik River is a subarctic riverine system shared between Norway, Russia, and Finland, subdivided by seven hydroelectric power dams that destroyed about 70% of natural spawning and nursing areas. Stocking is applied in certain river parts to support the natural brown trout population. Adjacent river segments with different management strategies (stocked vs. not stocked) facilitated the simultaneous assessment of genetic impacts of dams and stocking based on analyses of 16 short tandem repeat loci. Dams were expected to increase genetic differentiation between and reduce genetic diversity within river sections. Contrastingly, stocking was predicted to promote genetic homogenization and diversity, but also potentially lead to loss of private alleles and to genetic erosion. Our results showed comparatively low heterozygosity and clear genetic differentiation between adjacent sections in nonstocked river parts, indicating that dams prevent migration and contribute to genetic isolation and loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was low and heterozygosity relatively high across stocked sections. However, in stocked river sections, we found signatures of recent bottlenecks and reductions in private alleles, indicating that only a subset of individuals contributes to reproduction, potentially leading to divergence away from the natural genetic state. Taken together, these results indicate that stocking counteracts the negative fragmentation effects of dams, but also that stocking practices should be planned carefully in order to ensure long-term preservation of natural genetic diversity and integrity in brown trout and other species in regulated river systems.

AB  - Background: Wind power is a critical renewable energy technology in efforts to achieve the global climate targets. However, local impacts do occur, which demands careful consideration in planning and permitting. Sweden has set an ambition to triple land-based wind power by 2040, and municipalities play a key role in both the planning and permitting process, due to a planning monopoly and veto power in the permitting process. This calls for an investigation of Swedish wind power governance, with a particular focus on recent trends in municipal wind power planning, how wind power is balanced in relation to sustainability objectives in planning and permitting, and insights from practitioners regarding their capacities and drivers. Results: The results show that about two-thirds of Swedish municipalities have conducted wind power planning in some form, but this basis for decision-making has become outdated due to a lack of institutional capacity at the municipal level. Secondly, the study finds that many municipalities perceive that there are insufficient incentives for a continued wind power expansion. Lastly, the study sheds light on a large heterogeneity within wind power planning practice concerning how trade-offs between wind power deployment and other sustainability aspects are handled, as well as a lack of coherence between planning and permitting. Conclusions: It is concluded that the current state of municipal wind power planning raises questions regarding the legitimacy of municipal decision-making in terms of perceived justice among local inhabitants and highlights the need for updated wind power plans. Moreover, to promote local acceptance in the future, formalised financial compensation and strategic initiatives that enable the localisation of electricity-intensive industry within municipalities with large-scale wind power production can be two key components. The results also highlight the need for additional support at the municipal level, including access to critical competence and relevant knowledge to enable trade-offs between the different sustainability considerations in an informed and balanced manner. Finally, regional dialogue with key actors, such as the military, Sami representatives and grid operators, would facilitate the handling of inter-municipal issues, in particular by fostering co-operation regarding inter-municipal wind sites.

AB  - Strategies to densify urban fabric for both environmental and market purposes, place built heritage under increasing pressure. Over the last decade, a shift can be noted in the discourse on built heritage in Norway, where the requirements for 'dynamic management' that recognises these pressures is emphasised. There is also an increasing awareness of the connection between cultural heritage and sense of place. This paper examines the row of wooden warehouses in the historic core of Trondheim, how cultural heritage values are interpreted by different actors. The paper concludes that despite unanimous agreement about the need to preserve the warehouses, reasoning and solutions vary depending on differences and positions in the cultural heritage discourse.

AB  - Recent changes in Scandinavian cultural landscapes are summarised and the underlying causes discussed. The quantification of landscape change and the link between this change and impacts on biodiversity and amenity values at the landscape level are examined from practical and theoretical perspectives. Landscape ecology has given us new perspectives on nature conservation and planning issues, yet there remain problems associated with quantifying the effects of landscape change. Some of the key areas providing challenges for the future of landscape ecology are discussed. Many of the emerging principles of landscape ecology remain unproven or more subtle than first thought. As authorities grasp the idea that landscape ecology offers new tools for landscape planning, researchers need to consolidate efforts to classify and quantify landscapes, examine effects of landscape change on species interactions, be clear over the difference between ecological and statistical significance, increase hypothesis testing, and relate landscape ecology to society. The integration of landscape into international conservation agreements and conventions along with the increasing adoption of landscape level planning increases the need to generate general landscape principles and standards.

AB  - Swedish swamp forests have a considerable conservation value because of their rich biodiversity which includes many threatened species. They have been interpreted as refugia from fire with long histories of forest continuity. Palaeoecological investigation of a small swamp forest in northern Sweden shows that the forested area was under cultivation 500 years ago. The present forest has only developed during the last 300 years as a consequence of changes in land-use. Palaeoecology can be used to test assumptions about stability, disturbance and 'natural' vegetation. Results from such studies suggest that communities are highly dynamic, and conservation policy should create a framework within which dynamic processes can operate, in addition to species preservation. Our method is a potentially valuable tool in the formulation of future nature conservation policy.

AB  - The expansion of wind power in Sweden has brought increasing conflicts between the wind power industry and the interests of the military forces. This paper analyses the reasons for these perceived conflicts and suggests solutions for mitigating at least some of the problems. The analysis is based on literature studies, several semistructured interviews and workshops with stakeholders in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Finland and Norway.
   Some of the problems originate from diverging views on how various societal interests should be weighed against each other, others from uncertainties in the planning and investment environment. The wind power industry has difficulties predicting whether a project will be rejected by the armed forces and believes that the armed forces often change their view on a specific project during the planning process. The Swedish armed forces, on their part, perceive the planning process to be hampered by low-quality, unsubstantiated applications, which sometimes block potentially available areas for more serious applicants.
   Better communication to improve mutual understanding between the stakeholders and more efficient information systems regarding existing and planned wind power plants would help reduce planning uncertainties in the short term. Better information on how wind power and military installations affect each other in a technical sense could also be important. Early identification of areas with little or no risk of conflict with military interests would help decrease the proportion of projects rejected by the military. In a more far-reaching reform, the wind power planning and permit system could be changed to one similar to the current Danish system, which provides a more important role for comprehensive spatial planning than granting of permits for single projects.

AB  - In this study, we propose a conceptual approach to assessing biodiversity impacts in the life-cycle assessments (LCAs) of forest wood production with a focus on Nordic managed forests at the landscape level. As a basis for our methodology, we suggest assessing the proportion of the total land area of productive forest under the control of a forest owner that fulfils certain criteria that can be regarded as having a positive impact on the development of forest biodiversity. A similar assessment of the forest management performed on the surrounding land is used to define a site-specific reference situation. In the context of an attributional LCA, the suggested method for the specification of business-as-usual (BAU) or environmental quality objectives (EQO) baselines encourages forest owners to choose forest management options that increase the proportion of productive forest land with properties that are more favorable to biodiversity over time. We illustrate the BAU baseline approach with two examples in Sweden to calculate the biodiversity impact from wood production for individual forest owners using four biodiversity indicators from the Swedish national Environmental Quality Objectives (EQOS)-'Living Forests'. The approach defined in this study is at this stage only applicable to forestry assessments. Using a BAU baseline approach similar to that used for international climate reporting is a simple but novel approach that makes use of consensuses that have already been drawn and approaches that have already been established.

The governance challenge is thus to manage trade-offs between human needs and, at the same time, maintain the capacities of forests to provide us with these needs. Sweden provides a clear example of this kind of challenge. Traditionally, timber has been the most apparent contribution of the forest to Swedish national interests. However, due to competing land use, the identification of the wider role of forests in terms of multifunctionality has been recognized. Today, a number of functions, such as water quality and biodiversity together with cultural and social activities related to forests, are increasingly included as potential demands on forests in competition with traditional functions such as timber production. The challenge is thus related to trade-offs between different functions. How to balance the relationship and guide trade-offs between different functions of forests is, to a large extent, a matter of policy choice and the design of appropriate governance institutions and pro-active management activities. Based on perceptions among stakeholders on future competing demands and a literature review, the paper explore the multifunctionality of the Swedish forests and how it is affected by competing demands for land use; how multifunctionality is currently governed; and concludes by suggesting promising decision support methods to manage trade-offs between different functions.

AB  - Sweden's boreal forest has experienced radical changes caused by humans since the beginning of industrialization. Ecological structures, such as large trees, dead trees and deciduous trees, have been removed from the forest. Natural processes, like fire, have been suppressed leading to ecosystem degradation, even in forest reserves. Many species that directly or indirectly depend on natural structures and processes are disfavoured and the need for restoration is evident. In this study, the status of a Swedish boreal forest is analysed in the context of biodiversity restoration. Based on ecological qualities of a historic reference state, a restoration gap analysis was produced. This gap analysis provides a method to view forest degradation and measure its deviation from the reference state. Ecological qualities are relatively high in the study area compared with the region, mainly because recent logging in the region did not greatly affect the study area. However, relative to the reference state, the area has lost significant ecological qualities due to earlier human activity. To be successful, strategies for restoring degraded forests should ultimately have landscape level approaches. Therefore, restoration of ecological qualities will not only include reserves but also production forests. In production forests, management strategies should be adapted to the natural functioning of the ecosystem. Consideration of restoration and management aspects during planning and formation of reserves will help ensure long-term species conservation goals. Methods to restore lost ecological qualities are discussed in the context of re-introducing fire and producing old-growth characteristics that predominated in the pre-industrial period.

AB  - Despite signing the Mayors Climate Change Agreement, few US cities have made significant progress in either climate mitigation or adaptation. For the most part, European cities have been more effective, albeit with assistance from the European Union and their national governments. Several of the most successful European cities have implemented eco-districts, which have offered many lessons for overall sustainability planning. Using Malmo, Sweden as a case study, we ask how planners and elected officials learned from implementing an eco-district, focusing on experimentation with new technologies and approaches to planning. We identify how "double-loop learning", a term coined by Argyris and Shon, was at play in changing planning practice. As eco-districts are catching on in North American cities, there is much to be learned from European practice.

AB  - Spatial planning has gone through significant shifts in recent years. Planners today face land use challenges, such as sprawl reduction and mixed use redevelopment, which must be reconciled with technological innovations and changing political and economic pressures. At the same time, their end goal is not just to support economic growth, but also to improve people's health and social well-being in a place-based framework. Keeping in mind the debate on equity, participation and the achievement of sustainable well-being for all, this paper looks at these issues from both a theoretical point of view, as well as their practical implementation. It critically examines some aspects of spatial planning and territorial governance from Sweden and Switzerland, discussing their flaws and contradictions, as well as pointing out positive features. Overall, the paper suggests that current spatial planning philosophy should privilege an integrated holistic approach, avoiding policies that, in the name of increased speed and efficiency, might lead to partiality, randomness and fragmentation.

AB  - Controversies over forestry and environmental issues, including biodiversity, are common. Theory suggests that uncertainty may play a major role in framing biodiversity and its preservation. This paper examines written statements on biodiversity preservation published by two major Swedish organizations, i.e., the Swedish Forest Industries Federation and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, with different interests in forest use. Frame analysis suggests that when the actors pursue a certain policy course, both biodiversity-related uncertainty and lack of regulatory clarity are important factors contributing to dissimilar framings. This case study supports the general understanding that biodiversity-related uncertainty can have important implications for biodiversity preservation, in this case, via forest policy and legislation. Scientific uncertainty may allow actors with dissimilar interests in an issue to justify their standpoints. To successfully manage forest biodiversity in the future, legal frameworks must increasingly find ways to accommodate scientific uncertainty, and models must be developed in which stakeholders' diverging interests and values address uncertainties via dialogue.

AB  - Landscape changes, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, subdivide wild populations, reduce their size, and limit gene flow. These changes may further lead to depletion of genetic variation within populations as well as accelerating differentiation among populations. As a migratory species requiring large living areas, wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is highly vulnerable to human activity. The number and continued presence of wild reindeer have been significantly reduced due to accelerating anthropogenic habitat modifications, as well as displacement in benefit of domesticated herds of the species. As a basis for future management strategies we assess genetic structure and levels of genetic variation in Norwegian wild reindeer by analysing 12 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region in 21 management units with varying population sizes. Overall, both markers showed highly varying levels of genetic variation, with reduced variation in the smaller and more isolated populations. The microsatellite data indicated a relationship between population size and genetic variation. This relationship was positive and linear until a threshold for population size was reached at approximately 1500 reindeer. We found high levels of differentiation among most populations, indicating low levels of gene flow, but only a weak correlation between geographic and genetic distances. Our results imply that the genetic structure of Norwegian wild reindeer is mainly driven by recent colonization history, population size, as well as human-induced landscape fragmentation, restricting gene flow and leading to high levels of genetic drift. To sustain viable populations, conservation strategies should focus on genetic connectivity between populations.

AB  - In many parts of the world's forests, intensive management has resulted in habitat loss for several species. Among these, specialised woodpeckers (Aves: Picidae) have been affected negatively due to their high requirements for resources that are scarce in managed forests. We used the gradient of anthropogenic impact on forests in northern Europe's Baltic Sea region to (1) assess the relationship between the presence of four focal woodpecker species and forest naturalness and (2) quantify their requirements regarding specific resources in four different areas (south-central Sweden, southern Sweden, Lithuania and northeastern Poland). This study focused on specialised woodpecker species of the Dendropicini tribe: the three-toed (Picoides tridactylus), middle spotted (Dendrocopos medius), white-backed (Dendrocopos leucotos) and lesser spotted (Dendrocopos minor) woodpeckers. The occurrence of these species in landscape units of 100 ha was generally related positively to the degree of forest naturalness and to the amounts of resources considered critical for the suitability of their respective habitats. For the middle spotted woodpecker, basal areas >= 1.0 m(2) /ha of large-diameter deciduous trees (DBH >= 40 cm) were associated with a high probability of occurrence (>= 0.9). For the white-backed woodpecker, the same probability of occurrence was found for basal areas >= 1.4 m(2)/ha of deciduous snags (DBH >= 10 cm). Relationships between the occurrence of the three-toed and lesser spotted woodpeckers and snag abundance were more variable among study areas. The results suggest that specialised woodpeckers would benefit from an increase in the area of forest with natural properties. Moreover, they allow defining tentative quantitative targets for sustainable forest management. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Protected area (PA) is an indicator linked to policies on ecological sustainability. We analyzed area, size, and categories of PAs in the European boreal forest biome in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia from 1900 to 2010. The PA increased from 1.5 x 10(3) ha in 1909 to 2.3 x 10(7) ha in 2010. While the total PA in the boreal biome was 10.8 %, the figures ranged from 17.2 % in the northern, 7.9 % of the middle, and 8.7 % of the southern boreal sub-regions. The median size of PAs varied from 10 to 124 ha among countries. The categories of less strictly PAs increased over time. The proportion of area occupied by PAs is an important response indicator for conservation efforts. However, the use of PA as an indicator of ecological sustainability needs to consider ecosystem representation, functional connectivity and management categories.

AB  - A spatiotemporal machine learning framework for automated prediction and analysis of long-term Land Use/Land Cover dynamics is presented. The framework includes: (1) harmonization and preprocessing of spatial and spatiotemporal input datasets (GLAD Landsat, NPP/VIIRS) including five million harmonized LUCAS and CORINE Land Cover-derived training samples, (2) model building based on spatial k-fold crossvalidation and hyper-parameter optimization, (3) prediction of the most probable class, class probabilities and model variance of predicted probabilities per pixel, (4) LULC change analysis on time-series of produced maps. The spatiotemporal ensemble model consists of a random forest, gradient boosted tree classifier, and an artificial neural network, with a logistic regressor as meta-learner. The results show that the most important variables for mapping LULC in Europe are: seasonal aggregates of Landsat green and near-infrared bands, multiple Landsat-derived spectral indices, long-term surface water probability, and elevation. Spatial cross-validation of the model indicates consistent performance across multiple years with overall accuracy (a weighted F1-score) of 0.49, 0.63, and 0.83 when predicting 43 (level-3), 14 (level-2), and five classes (level-1). Additional experiments show that spatiotemporal models generalize better to unknown years, outperforming single-year models on known-year classification by 2.7% and unknown-year classification by 3.5%. Results of the accuracy assessment using 48,365 independent test samples shows 87% match with the validation points. Results of time-series analysis (time-series of LULC probabilities and NDVI images) suggest forest loss in large parts of Sweden, the Alps, and Scotland. Positive and negative trends in NDVI in general match the land degradation and land restoration classes, with "urbanization'' showing the most negative NDVI trend. An advantage of using spatiotemporal ML is that the fitted model can be used to predict LULC in years that were not included in its training dataset, allowing generalization to past and future periods, e.g. to predict LULC for years prior to 2000 and beyond 2020. The generated LULC time-series data stack (ODSE-LULC), including the training points, is publicly available via the ODSE Viewer. Functions used to prepare data and run modeling are available via the eumap library for Python.

AB  - In 1993 the Swedish parliament deregulated national forestry policy and established an environmental goal in parallel with the previous, long-standing goal of high wood production. This paper shows how the change occurred in the context of major changes in Swedish environmental policy during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Within a short time, new environmental legislation and the introduction of legal protection for small forest and agricultural habitats of high ecological value reoriented national forestry policy, away from an overriding focus on wood production to an increased awareness of nature conservation and biodiversity preservation. Reflecting a major compromise with the state, forest owners have gained greater freedom to manage their land, but must also improve environmental conditions while achieving high wood production, a policy known as 'freedom under responsibility'. The paper explains how both the parliament and industry supported increased nature conservation and biodiversity to maintain forest health and support the forestry industry, by favouring responsible resource use and not simply protection from human influence.

AB  - The location of Capercaillie lekking sites was compared in forest mosaics of different level of fragmentation. In north Finland the stand characteristics of the lekking sites did not differ from those of randomly selected stands in the 1950s judged from forestry maps and stand registers. In the 1980s, when forestry had considerably altered stand structure, lekking stands were older, larger and had a higher timber volume than random stands. These features evenly changed from the lek centre to the distance of 4 km, to which distance the adjacent areas were assessed. Southern and central Finnish analyses, based on topographic maps, showed that the proportion of forest distinctly decreased with increasing distance from a lek centre, up to a distance of 1-1.5 km. The average patch size of lekking stands were largest in the north (where both cut areas and remaining stands are large) and smallest in central Finland dominated by fine-grained forest landscape. The results are discussed in terms of landscape ecology and forestry planning.

TI  - Estimating Recreational and Commercial Fishing Effort for European Lobster <i>Homarus gammarus</i> by Strip Transect Sampling
T2  - MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES

AB  - Recreational fishing effort for coastalmarine species can be significant but is often challenging to estimate. Here we present a case study where a probability-based strip transect survey is used to estimate effort in the Norwegian fishery for European lobster Homarus gammarus. This fishery is conducted by both recreational and commercial fishers, but reliable information on total fishing effort and total catch is lacking. In 2008, we conducted a strip transect sampling survey throughout the lobster fishing season in southern Norway to estimate the number of deployed lobster traps over time. Surface buoys marking lobster traps were counted along strip transects placed representatively in the survey area in five different weeks throughout the lobstering season. Calibration studies were conducted to standardize transect width and to estimate and adjust for detection rates of buoys along transect strips. Mean number of lobster traps per square kilometer and associated variance was estimated by a ratio estimator using bootstrapping, with transects as the primary sampling units. Poststratification of the counts by depth (by 10-m depth intervals) combined with geographical information systems mapping improved the precision of the estimated density of lobster traps and increased the effective sample size of transects by 22-44% per week. Estimated daily effort for the first week was 48.95 (SE = 3.11) traps/km(2), decreasing steadily to 5.96 (SE = 0.79) in the eighth (and last) week of the lobster season. Our study shows that lobster traps deployed by recreational fishers outnumber the ones deployed by commercial fishers, contributing to 65% of the total effort (number of traps) in the fishery. We show that strip transects are a suitable way to estimate effort in the Norwegian lobster fishery. We conclude that improved management efforts need to target recreational as well as commercial fishing activities in order to achieve effective management of the red-listed species.

AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is one of the leading forest certification schemes. While many studies concern political aspects and social outcomes of FSC, little is known about the contribution of certification to biodiversity conservation. In Europe, the Russian Federation and Sweden have the largest areas of FSC-certified forest. We assessed the potential of FSC certification for boreal biodiversity conservation in terms of standard content, and outcomes as habitat area set aside and habitat network functionality. First, we compared the biodiversity conservation indicators at different spatial scales in Swedish and Russian FSC standards. Second, focusing on one large state forest management unit in each country, we compared the areas of formally and voluntarily set aside forests for biodiversity conservation. Third, we evaluated the structural habitat connectivity by applying morphological spatial pattern analysis, and potential functional connectivity by using habitat suitability index modelling for virtual species. The Russian standard included indicators for all spatial scales of biodiversity conservation, from tree and stand to landscape and ecoregions. The Swedish standard focused mainly on stand and tree scales. The area of voluntary set-asides for FSC was similar in Sweden and Russia, while formal protection in the Russian case study was three times higher than in the Swedish one. Swedish set-aside core areas were two orders of magnitude smaller, had much lower structural and potential functional connectivity and were located in a fragmented forestland holding. We conclude that to understand the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation both the standard content, and its implementation on the ground, need to be assessed. We discuss the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation with different levels of ambition. We stress the need for developing rapid assessment tools to evaluate outcomes of FSC for biodiversity conservation on the ground, which could be used by forest managers and FSC-auditors toward adaptive governance and management.

AB  - Umbrella species are often spatially demanding and have limited ability to adapt to environmental changes induced by human land-use. This makes them vulnerable to human encroachment. In Sweden, broadleaved trees are disadvantaged by forestry, and commercially managed forests are often deprived of dead wood. This has led to a situation where previously widespread top predators in saproxylic food webs, such as the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), have become species of conservation concern. The white-backed woodpecker is generally considered an umbrella species, and it has been linked to forests with large volumes of dead wood from broadleaved trees. In recent years, forest stands have been restored for the white-backed woodpecker, but post-treatment evaluations have rarely included other species that also occur in broad-leaved forests (co-occurring species). Many co-occurring species are saproxylic beetles. In this study, we collected saproxylic beetles and environmental data in restored and commercially managed forests to evaluate if habitat restoration for the white-backed woodpecker also benefited other species with similar habitat associations. We found that volumes of coarse woody debris were higher in restored than in commercially managed forests, and that a majority of man-made snags and downed logs were created from birch trees (Betula spp.). Most spruce trees (Picea abies) were extracted during forest restoration, and this opened up the forest canopy, and created stands dominated by broadleaved trees. Many saproxylic beetles were more common in restored forests, and there were significant differences in species composition between treatments. These differences were largely explained by species traits. Effects of sun-exposure were particularly important, but many beneficiary species were also linked to dead wood from broadleaved trees. Red-listed saproxylic beetles showed a similar pattern with more species and individuals in restored sites. The white-backed woodpecker is still critically endangered in Sweden, but important prey species are already responding to forest restoration at the stand level. We recognize that landscape-level improvements will be required to bring the white-backed woodpecker back, but also that the umbrella species concept can provide a useful framework for successful forest restoration as many co-occurring saproxylic beetle species seemingly benefitted from restoration for the white-backed woodpecker.

AB  - The importance of genetic variation for maintaining biological diversity and evolutionary processes has been recognized by researchers for decades. This realization has prompted agreements by world leaders to conserve genetic diversity, and this is an explicit goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Nevertheless, very limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity on a global scale. International conservation efforts to halt biodiversity loss focus on habitats and species, whereas little or no attention is paid to gene level variation. By this year, 2010, world leaders have agreed that a significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss should have been achieved. However, gene level diversity is still not monitored, indicators that can help identify threats to genetic variation are missing, and there is no strategy for how genetic aspects can be included in biodiversity targets beyond 2010. Important findings and conclusions from decades of conservation genetic research are not translated into concrete conservation action in the arena of international policy development. There is an urgent need for conservation geneticists worldwide to become involved in policy and practical conservation work beyond the universities and research institutions.

AB  - In the current scenario of human-induced environmental changes, boreal forest biodiversity appears to be threatened by both deforestation for timber production and climate change. A northern species which has experienced a decline due to ongoing habitat degradation in Finland is the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a forest-dwelling avian predator that inhabits mostly mature coniferous forests. In order to uncover possible interactive effects of climate and landscape structure on this species, we tested whether temperature and precipitation affect Goshawk reproductive performance differentially in closed (i.e. forest) or open (mainly forest-farmland mosaics) habitats, accounting for land cover at different distances from nests (250, 500, 1000 and 2500 m). Long-term data on brood size and individual chick weight were used to describe breeding success over an 18 year period. Brood size was negatively associated with March and May temperature and positively with June temperature, but no trends related to landscape structure were identified. Chick body condition was negatively affected by high forest cover closest to the nest (250 m), but negative effects of June precipitation on this variable proved to be significantly greater in open than in closed habitats, with results consistent at different scales, i.e. precipitation had greater negative effects on chick body condition in open than in closed landscapes. Precipitation is forecast to increase in the region as a result of climate change, hence forest cover could exert a positive role in mitigating adverse effects of unfavorable climatic conditions. Outcomes of this study may be used to inform sustainable timber harvest management strategies.

AB  - Domesticated landscapes are formed by complex social and ecological interactions. We study present-day remnants of species-rich hay meadows and pastures in Scandinavia, with historical roots in former infield systems', initially developed during the first centuries AD and maintained until the modernisation of agriculture during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Infield systems include infields, enclosed areas near farms incorporating hay meadows and crop fields, and surrounding outlying land used mainly for grazing. We interpret the development of Scandinavian infield systems and their relationship to vegetation and human culture using concepts of niche construction and entanglement. A key issue revolves around spatio-temporal stabilisation of managed grasslands, in turn related to a complex of interactions between cultural development (e.g. perceptions of land ownership and management practices) and ecological patterns (e.g. species richness). We propose that niche construction and entanglement are useful concepts bridging studies in social history and ecology, and for developing conservation programmes in cultural landscapes.

AB  - Using species and environmental data from an extensive grassland area in south-western Finland, we investigated the effect of patch area and connectivity, management and local habitat variables on the occurrence of spring-flowering vascular plants and their richness in boreal agricultural landscapes. Generalized linear models (GLM) and variation partitioning were used to study the explanatory power of the three groups of variables and their combined contributions on the richness and occurrence of six spring-flowering plant species. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and associated cross-validation tests were used to evaluate the predictability of the species occurrence and richness patterns. Present-day grassland patch area and connectivity were important predictors for occurrence and richness of the studied plant species. In addition, local habitat factors, especially radiation, accounted for major fractions of occurrence patterns of the studied species. Hybrid models including variables from all three variable groups had higher explanatory power and predictive capability than partial models. However, performance of the separate single-species models varied considerably between the six study species. Exclusion of radiation or connectivity from the hybrid models decreased their predictive performance, suggesting that these factors are of particular importance for grassland plant species at their northern range margins. When developing conservation and management planning for grassland plant species in Northern Europe, attention should be paid to well-connected networks of grassland patches including large, steeply-sloped patches with a favorable microclimate.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the content and importance of social impact assessment (SIA) in urban planning. SIA can be defined as a systematic effort to identify and analyse social impacts of a proposed project or plan on the individual, on social groups within a community, or on an entire community in advance of the decision making process. Social impacts of urban plans refer to various factors such as quality of housing, local services and living environment, gentrification or segregation, conditions of transportation etc. The article is focusing on the Finnish experiences. In Finland the new Land Use and Building Act, which came into force on 1.1.2000, brought impact assessment as an integral part of urban planning. The SIA experiences in Jyvdakyla City offer an interesting case study.

AB  - Pollen analyses were carried out at two sites with contrasting land-use histories (in-field and out-land) within a single estate. The aim was to distinguish the relative importance of natural processes and cultural influence on the development of vegetation and biodiversity. The estate lies in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden, and attention is focused on the distribution of coniferous and deciduous trees. The in-fields, which lie close to the estate buildings, are currently dominated by deciduous trees, and have a documented history as fields and hay meadows. The more distant out-lands were primarily used as grazing land in the past, and support coniferous forest at present. The study covers the last 4000 yr. 2000-1000 BC: the out-lands site supported natural, dense forests consisting of Quercus, Betula, Tilia, Alnus and Corylus. 1000 BC-AD 1100: several events are best interpreted as an increased cultural activity in the area. Agriculture was based on animal husbandry and the recorded cereals probably originate from a kind of shifting cultivation. AD 1000-1800: agriculture intensified on the in-fields with cereal cultivation of increased importance, while the out-fields were used for slash-and-burn agriculture and forest grazing. The forests became more open in structure but the composition remained unchanged. An increase in Calluna was a possible consequence of over-exploitation. AD 1800 onwards: the out-field deciduous forests were rapidly replaced by Picea-Pinus coniferous forests during the 1800's. The in-fields retained deciduous forest with a continuity of Quercus and other species.
   There is a close, positive relationship between floristic diversity and cultural influence during the last 4000 yr. A comparison is made with a similar investigation on another estate in the region, revealing small differences between the estates, but striking similarities in the effects of land-use types on the development of vegetation. The significance of former in-fields for nature conservation is discussed, particularly as a potential source for increasing the deciduous component in commercial forestry practice.

AB  - The relationship between heritage management and nature conservation in Sweden has changed over time, from an earlier division between the two sectors - with nature conservation attached to the growing movement of environmental politics - towards more integrated ways of working under the umbrella of sustainable development. As forests have been associated with nature, the earlier divide has been more evident with forested areas than agricultural areas, a view that has contributed to the marginalization of such landscapes and their inhabitants. With the more integrated policy, heritage management is drawn into the societal discourse of ecological modernization, where environmental and sustainability issues have become new business ideas and sources of further economic growth. From an ecological modernization perspective, nature and cultural heritage are today (touristic) commodities, enforcing the power of the urban world over the rural world and thus risk contributing to further marginalization of the inhabitants. However, heritage sites appear to function as boundary objects in local communities, and may thus function as meeting places and sources of enhancement of community pride. Therefore, we argue for community participation and public communication within the heritage sector, especially concerning marginalized, forested landscapes in order to contribute to an increased knowledge and understanding of the local heritage and history, thus opening the way for creative local processes.

AB  - Onshore wind farm development may impact vulnerable large eagles at both individual and population levels and requires appropriate assessment under the EU Bird and Habitat Directives. The present conservation policy (e.g. fixed safety zones around nest sites) improves species conservation but may not prevent habitat loss or reduce collision risk in the best possible way because this policy may not consider habitat-specific effects on eagle behaviour. Here, we develop a method for estimating habitat use and flying time distribution within Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) home ranges. Location data retrieved with GPS-transmitters (Global Positioning system) in Finland indicated that these large raptors used vast areas (mean 297 km(2), 95% Minimum Convex Polygon), reaching up to 14 km, but not uniformly around their nests. The best resource selection function models (cross-validation performance 83%) revealed that flying Golden Eagles preferred the vicinity of their nests, steep slopes, and old forests in their home range. They avoided human settlements and neighboring territories. GPS data indicated short flying times per day (mean 2.2 h) and about 30% of the flying time within collision risk heights (50-200 m). Together with information on habitat selection, flying times can be used for predicting airspace use of birds and in assessing the collision risk at particular wind farm locations. Thus, our method can be applied in planning wind farm locations that enable a safer co-existence of large territorial birds and wind power plants in the same landscape.

AB  - Introduction: The embedding of cities in a wider regional frame is central for long term planning regarding the transformation of such parts of society. This holds especially true for urban centers of national or sub national status. In this presentation we are drawing on 4 years of research work and stakeholder consultations in the Swedish part of the EU COMPLEX project dealing with the transition to non fossil societies. In our presentation the regional multi layered governance which encompasses both a large (the Swedish capital) city and its surrounding region with an archipelago of larger and smaller towns is at the heart of the presentation. Our core interest is in the transition to sustainable and resilient urban futures. Especially we are drawing on the experiences from the Swedish case in the EU project COMPLEX.
   Method: We are relying both on stakeholder consultations with regard to long term planning as well as on specific regional modelling efforts covering specific features as municipality planning, economic regional analysis, land use studies and cognitive analysis regarding decision making by individuals,
   Results: We have focused on the systemic interactions of many different kinds covering long term developments (up to 2050). Our focus is to analyze features of the transition process of our urban-region at large and the connected decision making features e.g. in terms of scenario elaborations.
   Discussion: We highlight the differences of opinions among a wide range of stakeholders with regard to their understanding of the issues, their ideological positioning about core matters of concerns and the various positions about appropriate paths for reaching the goals of the transition to a non-fossil urban-super region situation in our chosen case area.

AB  - The woodland key habitat (WKH) concept has become an essential instrument in biodiversity-orientated forest management in northern Europe. The philosophy behind the concept is basically the same in all of the countries: to conserve the biodiversity of production landscapes by preserving small habitat patches that are supposed to be particularly valuable. This article reviews the definitions, inventories and implementation processes of WKHs in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Sweden and the Baltic countries have similar WKH models, while the models in Finland and Norway are clearly deviating. Depending on the country, the definitions emphasize different factors, such as soil and bedrock properties, stand structure and occurrence of indicator species. The mean size of the WKHs varies considerably, from 0.7 ha (Finland) to 4.6 ha (Sweden). The degree of formal protection also differs. Preservation of WKHs is primarily based on forest legislation in Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and on forest certification in the other countries. The implementation of the WKH concept is inconsistent between the countries, resulting in different sets of habitats being included in the WKH networks. This makes direct comparisons between the countries difficult, and may hamper the generalization of research results into other areas.

AB  - 1. Suppression of wildfires in boreal landscapes has become widespread and has seriously affected many fire favoured species. However, little is known about the response of organism assemblages to large wildfires in regions with a long history of effective fire suppression, such as Scandinavia.
   2. We studied the short-term effects of a > 1600 ha wildfire on beetle assemblages in northern Sweden. The first summer after fire, beetles were sampled in 12 sites using 36 large window traps, half in old pine forest stands in the burned area and half in similar, but unburned control stands. The entire beetle assemblage and eight subgroups were analysed: saproxylics, non-saproxylics, moderately fire favoured, strongly fire favoured, fungivores, predators, cambium consumers and red-listed species.
   3. Species composition differed markedly between burned and unburned forests in all nine groups. Furthermore, beetle abundance was higher in the burned area for the entire assemblage and for saproxylics, both groups of fire favoured species, predators and cambium consumers. Species number was higher only for non-saproxylics, strongly fire favoured species and cambium consumers.
   4. Our results show that wildfire has rapid and strong effects on a wide range of beetles. However, we only trapped two individuals of fire-dependent beetles, which may suggest a lack of such species in the region, possibly due to > 100 years of fire suppression. At the regional scale, the studied wildfire may potentially increase the abundance of these beetles after a longer period of reproduction in the burned area.

AB  - Land use and climate change are the main drivers of biodiversity change. However, their relative roles in the decline of biodiversity are still insufficiently known. Climate change is expected to be globally most pronounced in the boreal biome, where another key driver affecting boreal species is forestry. In NW Europe almost all forest land outside protected areas is subject to systematic forest management practices including clear-cutting, thinning and replanting. In addition, a human-caused increase in herbivores, such as ungulates, may affect the forest vegetation structure and thereby also bird species. We studied population changes of a bird community in a southern boreal area in Finland over a period of 30 years and related changes in the bird community concerning both land use and climate variables. During the study the total bird density declined by 26%, i.e., 1%/year. Longdistance migrants and residents declined the most, both by 44%, and short-distance migrants by 29%, while partial migrants increased by 29%. Clear-cuts were the most important variable explaining the decline in the total bird density and the density change of long-distance and short-distance migrants and residents. In addition, the higher summer mean temperature was related to the decline of the total bird density and short-distance migrants, which were also moderately negatively affected by the ungulate density. The increase in partial migrants was mostly due to an increase in the numbers of two bird species, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, which have benefitted from human actions in many ways. As a whole, the bird community did not recover to the level that prevailed before the clear-cuts in the study period. This indicates that recolonisation and the recovery rate by birds in maturing young stands cannot fully compensate for the loss of birds resulting from the clear-cuts. Forest management practices should adopt more biodiversity-friendly methods, such as continuous cover forestry, to better maintain populations of forest birds.

AB  - Riparian forests often have a more diverse tree species composition and more woody debris than neighboring upland forests, but little is known about their importance for the conservation of deadwood-dependent species. We studied the forest characteristics and the diversity of wood fungi (poroid Aphyllophorales) in lakeside riparian (flat and sloping topography) and upland boreal forests in eastern Finland. Riparian forests had a higher density of broadleaved trees and broadleaved debris than did upland forests. A total of 48 species of wood fungi were recorded, including eight red-listed or old-growth forest indicator species. Overall, more species and records and greater diversity were observed in the flat riparian sites than in the sloped riparian and upland sites. The mean species richness did not differ significantly among site categories, indicating greater beta diversity among the flat riparian sites. Species composition was more similar between the two riparian categories than between the riparian and upland sites. Riparian sites also hosted more fungal species associated with broadleaved trees. The results show that riparian forests support the diversity of wood fungi in managed boreal forests. Diversity of deadwood-dependent organisms can be promoted by leaving wider and completely unharvested riparian buffer zones.

AB  - Large uprooted trees are typical old-forest structures that provide distinct microsites for sessile organisms. While the habitat value of treefall pits for plants is relatively well known, the characteristic exposed root-plates of treefall mounds, which may require different management, have received less attention. The aim of the current study was to explore key factors of lichen incidence and their community characteristics on root-plates. We mapped and described treefall mounds in 24 stands (2 ha each) in a balanced design representing mixed stands of two site types (mesotrophic; drained swamp) and two management types (old growth, mature commercial forest) in hemiboreal Estonia. First, the occurrence of any lichens and of a specialized pin lichen, Chaenotheca furfuracea, was recorded on all 1207 mounds found. According to multi-level logistic regression models, their incidence depended on every mound-scale variable tested: there were independent positive effects of root-plate area and treefall age, spruce treefall, and the absence of exposed pit. In contrast, weak stand-scale effects only appeared when their interactions with mound-scale variables were included or some main effects were eliminated. C. furfuracea also occurred more frequently where other inhabited root-plates were nearby, and such dispersal limitation interacted with habitat quality. Secondly, full lichen communities were described in detail on a subsample of 84 root-plates of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Altogether 48 lichen species were recorded, including eight red-listed or nationally rare species. The communities on large fresh root-plates and in mature drained stands had distinct species composition, while communities of older mounds and in old-growth stands converged in species composition. We conclude that lichen incidence on root-plates is mostly determined by colonization probability, and commercial forests can support a diverse lichen biota when large treefall mounds, particularly of P. abies and of >10 years age are provided. However, given some differences of lichen communities in old growth, and because treefall issues conflict with other management objectives in commercial forests, optimised management of treefall areas there should be complemented by their strict protection in reserves.

AB  - The development of a forest stand in south-eastern Norway during the last 9000 years is investigated by pollen and charcoal analyses. The aims are to identify factors that have influenced current biodiversity, which includes the lichen Usnea longissima, and examine the immigration and establishment of the current dominant tree Picea abies. Fire has been a variable but major disturbance factor at the site throughout the study period but has ceased during the last 100 years. Picea immigration was primarily a natural process but local establishment occurred after a major disturbance. Cultural impact began 3500 years ago during the Bronze Age, but was most intensive between AD 1600 and AD 1900. It led to the local extinction of deciduous trees and created a biodiversity bottleneck that facilitated the rise to dominance of Picea. Guidelines are proposed for future management designed to preserve and enhance local biological values. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of expert opinions on forest biodiversity indicators for protected areas, using a questionnaire given to forest experts in Turkey and Sweden. Experts were selected according to whether they had studied or worked in areas related to biodiversity, protected areas and sustainable forest management. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the differences between the opinions of Swedish and Turkish experts regarding the indicators. The experts from both countries considered "endemic species" and "naturalness" as the most important indicators, while "overused species", "forest distribution and regeneration", "carrying capacity in terms of important species of area" and "the existence of different conservation status of protected areas" were considered equally as the least important indicators. The most important difference between the two groups was related to the indicators "dead wood" and "hollow trees", which Swedish experts found more important than their Turkish counterparts. Two other large differences were that the Swedish experts found "litter layer" much more important and Turkish experts instead found "plant species composition" much more important. The differences between the two groups reveal different perspectives regarding the planning and management of protected areas in each respective country.

AB  - Increasing competition over the world's forest resources will likely aggravate conflict, though conflict should not be seen as bad per se. As the challenge is to develop institutions and practices capable of handling conflict constructively, various collaborative approaches involving disputing actors are evolving worldwide. In Sweden, most such approaches pertain to protected areas and few involve commercial forestry. The reasons for the rise of different approaches to collaboration in protected areas and commercially managed forest lands are explored through a comparison of two conflicts embedded in different management regimes. The study suggests that actor interdependence is critical to how collaboration evolves. Interdependence is in turn affected by the institutions, discourses, and economic context in which the process is embedded. When contextual factors are unfavourable, power relations too unequal, and interdependencies between dominant and subordinated actors weak, the prospects for collaboration are slim. In an enabling context, in contrast, mobilization may alter power relations and interdependencies, making collaboration possible. This study suggests that the low occurrence of collaborative land use planning in many parts of Sweden may be related to the presence of strong economic land use interests, un-successful mobilization of weaker parties, and absence of enabling institutional and discursive factors.

AB  - Increasing hydropower electricity production constitutes a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change impacts. However, hydropower electricity production also impacts aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity through freshwater habitat alteration, water quality degradation, and land use and land use change (LULUC). Today, no operational model exists that covers any of these cause-effect pathways within life cycle assessment (LCA). This paper contributes to the assessment of LULUC impacts of hydropower electricity production in Norway in LCA. We quantified the inundated land area associated with 107 hydropower reservoirs with remote sensing data and related it to yearly electricity production. Therewith, we calculated an average net land occupation of 0.027 m(2).yr/kWh of Norwegian storage hydropower plants for the life cycle inventory. Further, we calculated an adjusted average land occupation of 0.007 m(2).yr/kWh, accounting for an underestimation of water area in the performed maximum likelihood classification. The calculated land occupation values are the basis to support the development of methods for assessing the land occupation impacts of hydropower on biodiversity in LCA at a damage level.

AB  - To harvest more biofuel from forests, tree stumps are sometimes extracted after clearcutting. Species in different organism groups rely on deadwood, and biofuel extraction reduces their substrate. Our aim was to investigate the potential landscape effects of stump extraction, and compare the effects among trophic levels of deadwood dependent (saproxylic) beetles. We sampled saproxylic beetle species in clearcut stumps using bark sieving. We did the study in 2013 in 49 clearcuts (1-4 years old) in three regions in central Sweden where stump extraction had been performed for six years prior to sampling. We selected landscape buffers with 500m, 1000m, and 2000 m radius with different intensities of stump extraction (0-100%). We show for the first time, based on empirical data, that increasing stump extraction can affect deadwood-dependent species at the landscape level. On average, obligate predators were more negatively affected than cambivores and facultative predators. The 34 studied saproxylic beetle species showed varied responses to stump extraction in the surrounding landscape, including stable (no response), negative, or positive responses. Positive responses could be due to a crowding effect, indicating a time-lagged response to habitat loss. Since stump extraction in the study area started just six years prior to sampling, time-lags in population-level responses could be expected. The age of the sampled clearcuts influenced the abundance of eleven species, but other local factors had little effect on abundance.
   Our results suggest that if stump extraction is widely introduced, deadwood retention planned for both spatial and temporal continuity should be an integrated part of intensified forest management. We suggest monitoring the long-term effects of stump extraction.

AB  - The Norwegian integrated management plan for the Lofoten-Barents Sea areas (BSMP) was initiated in 2002 following an international push for implementing ecosystem-based management, as well as a national drive to make new areas available for petroleum exploitation.. Governance of the plan was achieved through an inter-ministerial steering group working through its underlying institutions that have been tasked to work together during both development and implementation. This has achieved a high degree of integration across sectors and between government levels. Having the dual objectives of sustainable exploitation and conservation gives rise to a conflict over whether or not to allow petroleum industry access to the ecologically most valuable and vulnerable areas. There was an attempt at resolving this conflict by acquiring more knowledge, but the conflict is fundamentally a value-based question, which is impossible to resolve by gathering empirical knowledge alone. Nevertheless, the BSMP has been a positive vehicle for increasing the legitimacy of the complex decisions a modern society has to take in the management of ocean resources.

AB  - Natal dispersal has profound consequences for populations through the movement of individuals and genes. Habitat fragmentation reduces structural connectivity by decreasing patch size and increasing isolation, but understanding of how this impacts dispersal and the functional connectivity of landscapes is limited because many studies are constrained by the size of the study areas or sample sizes to accurately capture natal dispersal. We quantified natal dispersal probability and natal dispersal distances in a small migratory shorebird, the Southern Dunlin Calidris alpina schinzii, with data from two extensively monitored endangered metapopulations breeding in Sweden and Finland. In both metapopulations philopatry was strong, with individuals returning to or close to their natal patches more often than expected by chance, consistent with the patchy distribution of their breeding habitat. Dispersal probabilities were lower and dispersal distances were shorter in Sweden. These results provide a plausible explanation for the observed inbreeding and population decline of the Swedish population. The differences between Sweden and Finland were explained by patch-specific differences. Between-patch dispersal decreased with increasing natal patch size and distance to other patches. Our results suggest that reduced connectivity reduces movements of the philopatric Dunlin, making it vulnerable to the effects of inbreeding. Increasing connectivity between patches should thus be one of the main goals when planning future management. This may be facilitated by creating a network of suitably sized patches (20-100 ha), no more than 20 km apart from each other, from existing active patches that may work as stepping stones for movement, and by increasing nest success and pre-fledging survival in small patches.

AB  - This article investigates how the framing of nature conservation in terms of sustainable development both enables and constrains participation at the grassroots level. The Green Belt of Fennoscandia, an initiative to develop a transnational ecological network between Finland, Russia and Norway, is used as a case study. A desk study and 40 interviews with participants of two regional working groups from this initiative show how the mobilisation of the concept of sustainability encourages actors in rural areas to become leaders of projects in favour of both nature conservation and economic development. This research also describes how the lack of state engagement and potential conflicts between regional and national levels can discourage these actors to commit to the initiative. This research refines previous work on the reduction of the role of the state in conservation, illustrating the scalar dynamics of sustainable development implementation in a European rural context. It provides material to inform the governance of large-scale conservation projects, by highlighting how an approach that aims to boost local participation can in fact discourage it, if the reduction of the role of the state is not accompanied by resources, formal rights to democratic representation or/and an acknowledgement of past work.

AB  - Forestry in Sweden today is in the process of developing forestry methods on commercial sites so that conservation becomes an integral part of profitable forestry. Examples of such silvicultural methods are clearcutting, leaving seed trees of pine, shelterwoods and nurse trees over spruce regeneration. Techniques, methods and machines used in different stages of stand development are discussed. The costs, risks and benefits of the different methods are also discussed. To meet the objectives of pursuing a more efficient, sustainable and ecologically-sound forestry, improved planning and monitoring will be needed. Examples include a broader use of GPS and GIS. There is also development towards more environmentally-sound technology in Swedish forestry machines.

AB  - Land use changes resulting in the loss of farmland have been the focus of growing public concern and have led to the development of preservation policies worldwide. There is a need to develop adequate tools to monitor such changes in order to inform and improve farmland management policies. The present study investigates to what extent the periodic updating of Norwegian land cover data (as part of AR5, the Norwegian land capability classification system and dataset) can satisfy the need to monitor farmland decrease. GIS analysis was performed for two municipalities. Changes during a c.10-year period were analysed and uncertainties in the results explored. The analysis reveals that farmland loss due to reversible processes is far more important than loss through irreversible processes such as development. Uncertainty related to the identified changes is found to be small enough to leave no doubt about the prevailing change processes in the study area, yet could be of great importance for the most minor change processes. Uncertainties in need of further consideration relate to ambiguous categories, such as regrowth processes. Further modelling of border uncertainty and classification uncertainty is needed to understand fully the importance of uncertainty.

AB  - Background Forest management affects the viability of forest grouse populations, causing alterations to habitat quality. At the regional level, common targets for wood harvesting and safeguarding of specific habitats are negotiated between various stakeholders. Analysing potential trade-offs between forest grouse habitats and wood production in the region could support resource-smart decision making. Methods In this paper, we compiled trade-off curves represented as production possibility frontiers demonstrating the relationship between forest grouse habitat area and wood removal, using a Finnish forestry dynamics model and the Finnish Multi-Source National Forest Inventory. For the modelling of forest grouse habitats, a landscape-level occurrence model based on nationwide wildlife triangle census data was used. Five alternative forest scenarios in terms of wood removal were compiled for two study areas in Finland representing two different landscape structures. Results and conclusions Results showed that impacts on forest grouse habitats were case-specific. In the southern study area, increasing the roundwood harvesting rate affected grouse habitats more strongly as forests were already fragmented for other land uses and became more spruce-dominated over time. If the maximum sustainable removal rate was implemented, predicted grouse habitat area was 55% less than in a no-removal scenario. In the eastern study area, a more heavily forested region, the decrease was far lower at 22%. Scenario results were also compared to levels of recorded (business as usual) wood removal and that envisaged by valid regional forestry programmes, and their sustainability in terms of grouse habitat area was discussed. The production possibility frontiers calculated in this study support the evaluation of the loss of suitable habitat caused by different wood harvesting rates, or vice versa, the economic cost of increasing habitat areas.

AB  - Nature conservation in Norway is based on the idea that wilderness and forest nature reserves should be left to develop naturally. Several studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found. It is concluded that to ensure successful conservation of the biodiversity of these and other such forests, former land use practices should be documented, and management schemes should be developed on the basis of the acquired knowledge.

AB  - Modern forestry alters the structure of boreal forest landscapes, and this affects several forest species with different habitat requirements. Quantitative analyses of the structure of real landscapes are scarce, although this information will be needed in landscape-level planning and management applications. We investigated the occurrence and configuration of mature forest (> 80-100 year) in relation to five different extents (ranging from 20 to 7 854 ha) of circular landscapes around random points in managed forest environment in NE Finland. The habitat type was coarsely chosen according to requirements of certain resident birds and mammals. We present an approach where species-specific home-range scales are related to the observed environmental heterogeneity pattern for assessing the potential of actual landscapes to maintain these species. As a result we found that there is a minority of landscapes where total area of mature forest was comparable to species' home ranges. Irrespective of the scale examined, the average proportion of habitat in a landscape was approximately 15%. Besides that the mature forest was physically fragmented already on a scale relevant to individual animals, the variation in habitat proportion between landscapes decreased rapidly when the landscape extent was increased. This decrease of variation occurs on surprisingly small scales; the forest landscape structure is unintentionally altered due to small-patterned land ownership, even age distribution of managed stands, and small variation in regeneration patch size. In terms of related landscape metrics, we also compare our results with patterns achieved in randomly generated neutral landscape models.

AB  - Globally, direct and indirect human impacts have led to the widespread degradation of marine ecosystems. The resulting loss of habitat and marine biodiversity has led to the increased impetus for marine ecosystem restoration at a policy level. The success of such programs relies on an understanding of the nature of public support for marine restoration. This article examines such support through a survey of the attitudes of the general public in Norway and Italy. The results show that among both populations, there is broad support for restoration despite a lack of awareness of marine restoration activity. Differences in responses to the attitudinal questions across countries were tested using standard statistical independence tests and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Results show significant differences between samples in attitudes toward the completion of restoration and attitudes toward how restoration should be funded. Examining within-group variation, for both samples, regression analysis indicates that a mixture of socioeconomic and context-specific variables are significant predictors of awareness and attitudes toward restoration, while environmental awareness is a positive and significant indicator of attitude toward restoration.

AB  - This article explains how infrastructures with a sustainability record may evolve over time into a lock-in that slows the emergence of more sustainable urban infrastructures. A study of waste incineration in the Goteborg Metropolitan Area, Sweden, serves as an illustrative case. Taking leads from Unruh (2000, 2002), four rationales of lock-in are identified in the case: institutional, technical, cultural, and material. The article describes how these rationales, one by one and in collaboration, lock-in waste handling in the Goteborg Metropolitan Area to incineration. The article also suggests that these four rationales could serve as a program to unlock urban infrastructures. Asking the question "Are we in a lock-in?" is featured as a practical starting point for planning changes in urban infrastructure governance that contribute to sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crows have successfully colonized many cities, and urban zoos have been important in this process. To evaluate why zoos attract crows, we quantified crow numbers and behavior in three zoos in Europe (Debrecen, Edinburgh, Vienna) and one in Asia (Sapporo). Data were collected in 445 surveys over 297 days in summer 2014 and winter 2014-2015. We found that crow numbers were highest in Vienna, intermediate in Debrecen and Edinburgh and lowest in Sapporo, increased significantly from summer to winter (Debrecen, Edinburgh, Vienna), and from mornings to afternoons (Debrecen, Sapporo, Vienna), and were higher in sunny weather than in cloudy weather with precipitation and when visitor numbers were low (Debrecen, Vienna). The crows' use of natural food was highest in Vienna, intermediate in Edinburgh and Sapporo, and low in Debrecen. The use of anthropogenic food was high in Debrecen and Sapporo, where the availability of open grassy areas typically used by crows for natural foraging was low. In Sapporo, food availability was more limited than in other zoos, resulting in strong territoriality and few crows in summer, which decreased further in winter. Our study indicates that crows are primarily attracted to zoos by food availability and secondarily by breeding opportunities and that the relative importance of natural versus anthropogenic food sources may vary with zoo habitat structure. Our study draws attention to a previously overlooked role of zoos in urban biodiversity conservation. It may also provide useful information for the management of crow populations, if necessary, and for the planning of urban areas.

AB  - Catchments form an important terrestrial-aquatic habitat complex for biodiversity conservation and human well-being. Riparian and stream components are debated about how much habitat need to be maintained or restored in rivers subject to habitat degradation and fragmentation. Using brown trout as a focal species we tested the hypothesis that presence of suitable habitat in lotic stream sections can be predicted using habitat modelling. We modelled brown trout habitat at the catchment scale in terms of quality, size, juxtaposition of stream segments using digital elevation data, and presence of dams. The habitat models were validated against presence-absence data for local brown trout populations. A self-reproducing brown trout population was defined as having three year-classes. We identified the required minimum length (270 m) of a lotic stream section hosting a local brown trout population, corresponding to 3500 m(2). Adjacent areas of lotic stream habitat between dams had a significant positive effect on brown trout presence. The abundance of brown trout was significantly positively correlated to habitat quality, and negatively to hydropower water regulation. Critical habitat loss thresholds can be used for gap analysis regarding selection of dams to be removed and where restoration measures will be most effective in a catchment.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity's national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) are major mechanisms for mainstreaming biodiversity into national policies. This article examines whether and how the NBSAPs contribute to mainstreaming biodiversity across policy sectors in Finland in order to halt biodiversity loss. We have developed an innovative analytical framework where the concept of responsibility addresses how motivations for mainstreaming can be built, and the concept of social learning outcomes addresses the extent of institutional changes for biodiversity. The Finnish NBSAP processes have been able to build diverse forms of responsibility (liability, accountability, responsiveness and care) in different policy sectors by providing new knowledge, careful process design and developing institutional linkages. Despite pro-biodiversity outcomes in the targeted policy sectors, the responsibilities do not diffuse from the environmental administration to other policy sectors to a sufficient extent. Closing this 'responsibility gap' is a key challenge for building effective environmental policies.

AB  - While sustainable forest management (SFM) policy processes are well developed, implementation on the ground remains a challenge. Given the diversity of biophysical conditions, economic histories and governance systems on the European continent, regionally and temporally adapted and adaptive solutions are needed for both social and ecological systems. To illustrate this, we apply (1) a biographic forest and woodland history approach to central Sweden's Bergslagen region, where boreal sustained yield forestry was widely applied first and (2) a comparative case study approach using five European landscapes that represent different forest history phases in Scotland, Germany, Ukraine and Russia. Additionally, we illustrate the need to learn from reference landscapes for natural forest and cultural woodland systems such as in economically remote regions in Romania, Russia and on the Iberian Peninsula. We conclude that there is great opportunity for innovative knowledge production about both governance and management for different SFM dimensions based on comparisons among concrete landscapes. In addition, there is a need to develop local place-based social learning processes that are characterized by a focus on a geographical area, commitment to SFM policy visions and collaborative approaches to development that include both ecological and social systems.

AB  - A better understanding of how the spatial configuration of cities, understood as urban structure and forms, can achieve sustainable development is needed. This paper presents spatial data and an automated workflow for studying the urban structures (i.e., road and transportation networks) and forms (i.e., building size, position, function and density) of two medium-sized European cities - Bergen, Norway and Zurich, Switzerland. The data focuses on examining correlations between the densification patterns and transport energy usage of these cities de Koning et al., (2020). Spatial and tabular datasets for (i) urban structures, (ii) urban forms, (iii) building density, (iv) road centre lines and (v) transport energy usage are obtained as georeferenced files from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and upon request from collaborating local and national authorities. Transport energy data is derived from traffic data collected from the Norwegian Public Road Authorities or simulated via a traffic model. Opensource data is used wherever possible. Data gaps within proprietary data are supplemented with proxies or open-source data.
   Hand-drawn axial maps drawn by the authors using the Space Syntax methods and analysed via depthmapX software are a crucial dataset presented here. All analysed data are then returned to a Geographical Information System (GIS) platform and processed via an automated workflow of 19 steps built via the ModelBuilderTM tool in ESRI (R) ArcGIS. The automated workflow allows for repetitive cross-city comparison and the compilation of diverse spatial data sources for analysis.
   In combination with the novel workflow, the dataset can be used for future comparative studies in spatial planning, transport planning and management of energy systems to facilitate informed decision-making towards more sustainable developments. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Land use and changes in land use have a significant impact on biodiversity. Still, there is no agreed upon methodology for how this impact should be assessed and included in LCA. This paper presents a methodology for including land use impact on biodiversity in Life Cycle Impact Assessment and provides a case example from forestry operations in Norway.
   Materials and Methods. The methodology presented applies indirect assessments of biodiversity based on knowledge on what key factors are important for maintaining biodiversity in a boreal forest. These are used to construct an index on Conditions for Maintained Biodiversity. In addition the intrinsic quality of an area is assessed on the basis of the Ecosystem Scarcity and Ecosystem Vulnerability. Globally available data on ecoregions are here used. In addition the spatial and temporal impact is assessed based on the annual regrowth of the forest.
   Results. In the case study different forestry management regimes for the ecoregions 'Scandinavian and Russian taiga' and Scandinavian coastal coniferous forests' are compared. Based on the proposed methodology, the intrinsic quality difference of the two ecoregions is estimated to approximately 40% and the reduction in impact on biodiversity from land use by adopting new and realistic targets for the key factor 'areas set aside' is estimated to 20%.
   Discussion. The paper presents a new methodology for how land use impacts on biodiversity can be included in LCA. The methodologv is based upon a proposed framework and the results from the case study show that the methodology is capable to distinguish between different forestry management regimes and forestry in different ecoregions. The data used are readily available, but more research is needed to scale the proposed key factors and also include new key factors. It is at present not possible to validate the size of the differences.
   Conclusions. The importance of land use impact on biodiversity is of major importance and should be included in LCIA. The proposed methodology is developed within a framework developed within the UNTEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative and provides a methodology demonstrated to be able to distinguish between both similar activities in different ecoregions and different management practices within one ecoregion.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. More work is needed to establish a methodology for land use impact on biodiversity in LCIA and due to the importance this should be a prioritized task. The proposed application of indirect indicators to assess impact on biodiversity from land use changes in LCIA should be further explored, but the proposed methodology can already be applied with globally available data on ecoregions. The challenge is to develop sound key factors for the relevant ecosystems.

AB  - Environmental factors are regarded and co-ordinated with timber production on stand level in the presented model. Biodiversity indicators are dimension graded amounts of living and dead wood. The proportions of deciduous tree species, large trees, passability by foot and sight between stems are relevant recreation factors. Three expressions are derived in the range from 0 (no value) to I (best estimated value) to illuminate effects on: (1) timber production; (2) biodiversity; and (3) recreation. The model is applied on forests in southern Sweden, transformed from monocultures of planted softwood stands, into naturally regenerated, mixed stands managed to achieve sustainability.

AB  - The number of longhorn beetles with confirmed aggregation-sex pheromones has increased rapidly in recent years. However, the species that have been studied most intensively are pests, whereas much less is known about the pheromones of longhorn beetles that are rare or threatened. We studied the cerambycid beetle Plagionotus detritus ssp. detritus with the goal of confirming the presence and composition of an aggregation-sex pheromone. This species has suffered widespread population decline due to habitat loss in Western Europe, and it is now considered threatened and near extinction in several countries. Beetles from a captive breeding program in Sweden were used for headspace sampling. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that collections from males contained large quantities of two compounds, identified as (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone (major component) and (S)-2-hydroxy-3-octanone (minor component), in addition to smaller quantities of 2,3-hexanedione and 2,3-octanedione. None of the compounds was present in collections from females. When tested singly in a field bioassay, racemic 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2-hydroxy-3-octanone were not attractive to P. detritus, whereas a 5:1 blend elicited significant attraction. Both compounds are known as components of the pheromones of conspecific beetles, but, to our knowledge, this is the first cerambycid shown to use two compounds with different chain lengths, in which the positions of the hydroxyl and carbonyl functions are interchanged between the two. The pheromone has potential as an efficient tool to detect and monitor populations of P. detritus, and may also be useful in more complex studies on the ecology and conservation requirements of this species.

AB  - Alvar grasslands are thin-soil calcareous grasslands on Silurian and Ordovician limestone bedrock. They are considered unique plant communities for northern Europe and America with a high conservation value. Until now, European alvar grasslands have only been described in Sweden and Estonia. We described species-rich alvar grasslands on the Izhora plateau, NW Russia and compared this vegetation with that of Estonian alvar grasslands. Floristic composition and environmental conditions of Russian alvars were similar to Estonian alvar grasslands on thicker dry soil. Russian alvars are isolated from similar communities in Estonia, but extensive transport of domestic animals from Estonia to NW Russia in past centuries has probably enhanced species dispersal. Some characteristic Estonian alvar species were missing in NW Russia because it lies outside their natural ranges. Other differences in vegetation were explained by higher atmospheric nitrogen deposition and younger age of Russian sites. In NW Russia the alvar grasslands were small, but several red-listed plant species were present. In order to preserve European alvar vegetation effectively, Russian alvar grasslands need further study and conservation as an outpost of this threatened vegetation type.

AB  - The red-listed butterfly Lopinga achine was studied by mark-recapture methods in southern Sweden for three seasons. We examined movement within and between populations and egg production in relation to age. The majority of the movements were small with mean movements between recaptures of 45-54 to for males and 94-116 m for females. There were few movements between sites, 20 of 996 recaptured males moved and 36 of 391 recaptured females, even though the distance to other sites was in many cases < 100 m. The distance moved and the number of females moving between sites increased with increasing age. On average, a female that moves does so after laying two-thirds of its eggs in its natal site. It is therefore important to take account of the proportion of reproductive effort involved in dispersal when estimating colonisation ability. The males did not move more with increasing age. Female behaviour can be seen as a "spread-the-risk" strategy, an adaptation to the successional habitat of L. achine, whose natal site sooner or later will deteriorate. Butterflies like L. achine living in successional habitats may exhibit mobility that is intermediate between butterflies living in ephemeral habitats (very mobile) and in long-lived habitats (sedentary).

AB  - Semi-natural dry grasslands have almost disappeared in the modern farmland of southwestern and central Europe. In the northern and eastern parts of Europe, however, this species-rich habitat is still relatively common, albeit in a phase of rapid loss. To halt this decline the Swedish government started a large-scale subsidy scheme for the management and restoration of semi-natural pastures mainly aimed at increasing botanical values. We compared and contrasted the current management prescriptions with habitat preferences of 23 farmland bird species breeding in 88 dry semi-natural pastures in south-central Sweden. Semi-natural pastures showed very high breeding densities of several farmland birds underlining the importance of this habitat to the conservation of farmland birds. A TWINSPAN classification of all birds identified two groups of pastures with different bird communities. Eleven (48%) of the bird species were significantly more common in a group of pastures situated in open farmland, while only five (22%) species occurred in higher densities in pastures characterised by a high proportion of forest along the borders. Fifteen (83%) of the 18 species occurring in both pasture groups showed significant habitat-abundance relationships related to the management of semi-natural pastures, although in different directions and to different extents. Our results suggest that many farmland bird species require two important factors for their choice of breeding habitat, namely safe nest sites close to good foraging areas. Both factors are partly under the control of farmers and should be invoked in conservation strategies since many farmland birds are declining across Europe. To benefit the conservation of farmland birds in Sweden one should, in contrast to the present botanical-based subsidy scheme, retain greater than or equal to 10% cover of shrubs within pastures and preferentially select pastures in open farmland (i.e. potentially safer nesting sites with better food conditions) for restoration and management plans.

AB  - Ski resorts are important tourist attractions in boreal and alpine regions. However, land use related to development of such mass tourism may damage ecosystems. We investigated the impact of ski resorts on water quality of lakes near two popular ski resorts in Finland. Furthermore, we examined how water quality problems induced by ski resorts relate to effects of agriculture and forestry on similar lake types. Human impact significantly increased nutrient concentrations, although the differences observed between impact and control lakes were generally small. Water quality of the ski resort lakes and lakes polluted by agriculture and forestry appeared to be quite similar, with the exception of a small, humic ski-resort lake with extremely high nutrient concentrations. Two ski-resort lakes and one agricultural lake failed the total phosphorus criteria set for reaching good ecological status. Our results indicate that water protection measures should be considered more carefully in management of ski resorts.

AB  - This article discusses the impact of the Norwegian government's administrative reform on the management of the Norwegian aquaculture industry and coastal areas. The 2010 reform of government administration strengthened the County Councils' role in issues of aquaculture at the expense of the regional offices of the Directorate of Fisheries. The aim of the reform was to increase self-governance through decentralization. However, international trends in coastal zone and marine resource management are moving in the opposite direction, aiming at more integrated and ecosystem-based approaches involving the management of larger, rather than smaller, geographic regions. This article examines the possible effects of this reform in light of the move from government to governance, and in the context of a broad policy shift toward a more integrated, ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the coastal zone. Based on insights from multilevel and coastal zone governance debates, we argue that an unintended consequence of the Norwegian administrative reform could be increased fragmentation of the aquaculture governance system, as well as a reduced capacity to implement EBM-related measures. At the same time, the reform might improve coastal zone planning, although a further step toward integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) would require a greater delegation of authority to the County Councils.

AB  - Norway has a significant aggregate industry and there is potential for further growth. However, there are usually competing land-use interests. Integrated land-use planning requires accessible and unbiased information on natural resources. The Geological Survey of Norway manages and maintains databases of Norwegian aggregates, sand, gravel and hard-rock deposits, with maps, qualitative and quantitative information. In the Jaeren region on the southwestern coast, regional authorities are planning the future supply of aggregates. In a neighbouring region, a quarrying company is developing the Sat hard-rock deposit. These cases are used to underline the importance of geological information in the future development of existing quarries or when there are conflicting land-uses at the planning stage.

AB  - Protecting biodiversity within separate set-aside conservation areas has not been effective enough to halt its loss. Thus, new approaches to conserve biodiversity alongside production are needed. The non-market values of a forest may play an essential role when the forest owner decides the use of their land. However, so far the service offerings other than related to timber production, have been scant. The mismatch between decision support services offered and the service interests of forest owners may result in the objectives of forest owners remaining unfulfilled. The aims of this study were to explore the links between family forest owners' forest management preferences and their objectives for the forest and secondly their preferences for decision support services. Data were collected in a postal survey in the Northern Karelia region, Finland in spring 2014. Data consist of 298 survey answers that were analysed using multi-variate analyses. Two typologies were combined: clustering of forest ownership objectives and the preferred forest management style. We found that the forest owner's objectives were demonstrated by their preferred way of managing the forest. Opinions about different decision aid services varied between cluster groups. The groups emphasizing nature values considered biodiversity related information about their forest more necessary than other groups. They were also less satisfied with the usability of the forest management plan. Forest advisory services should better acknowledge the prevalence of multiple objectives also among forest owners who are interested in timber selling. Developing services for forest owners with diverse socio-economic backgrounds, information needs and objectives is important.

AB  - Urban living lab (ULL) experiments are expected to create grounds for circular city transitions but their temporal dynamics remain understudied. This study investigates the linkages of a particular sanitation experiment to a long-term urban development trajectories in the Hiedanranta ULL in the City of Tampere, Finland. The ethnographical study focuses on the temporal matches and mismatches of three interrelated timescales affecting the transformative potential of the experiment: (1) the experiment's life cycle, (2) the brownfield ULL and (3) the formal land-use planning of the future city district. Temporal analysis showed that the creation of transformative capacity requires a long development trajectory beyond a single experiment. In this case, the long-term development of R&D networks and the persistence and maturation of the ULL with its variety of co-developing experiments enabled experiment implementation; changed the city's sustainability discourse; and nurtured prominent cross-sectoral initiative of a super block. However, further implementation of ULL innovations in urban planning has proven to be difficult without a clear orchestrator. Practical recommendations highlight the need to clarify the strategic role of the ULL in experimental governance, transparent ULL processes that support learning, and overcoming transition barriers in the rigid infrastructure sector.

AB  - The rarefaction technique is applied to two Holocene pollen sequences (covering the last 12,000 calendar years) from two lakes in southern Sweden. One represents an open agricultural landscape, the other a partly wooded and less cultivated landscape. The inferred palynological richness is interpreted as an approximate measure of floristic diversity at the landscape scale. The overall trend is an increased diversity from the mid-Holocene to the Modern period, which is linked to a parallel rise in human impact. The pattern is similar for the two sites with peaks corresponding to archaeological periods characterised by deforestation and expanding settlement and agriculture. The highest diversity was reached during the Medieval period, about A.D. 1,000-1,400. Declining diversity during the last 200 years characterises the agrarian landscape. These results confirm, for southern Scandinavia, the "intermediate disturbance" hypothesis for biodiversity at the landscape scale and on millennial to century time scales. They have implications for landscape management in modern nature conservation that has the purpose of maintaining and promoting biodiversity.

KW  - Food consumption
KW  - Diets
KW  - Life cycle assessment
AB  - Purpose Agricultural land use and land-use change, especially from forests to agricultural land, to satisfy growing demand for food and feed, is a major cause of global biodiversity loss. International trade connects food consumption to land use across the world, leading consumption in one area to affect ecosystems elsewhere. However, methods for evaluating the effects of food consumption on biodiversity are still under development. Here, we evaluate two recent land-use-based biodiversity life cycle impact assessment methods, using the Finnish diet as a case study.
   Methods Two different land-use-based biodiversity impact assessment methods (Chaudhary and Books 2018; Kuipers et al. 2021) were used to evaluate the biodiversity impacts of five dietary scenarios: the current Finnish diet and four alternative scenarios that involve a gradual reduction in the intake of foods of animal origin. The assessment was conducted using the previously developed FoodMin model. The model assesses the climate impact and nutritional quality of diets based on 90 food product groups. The countries of origin for each product group, as well as the land occupation and land-use change associated with the products, were determined using five-year averages from national import and international yield and land-use change statistics.
   Results and discussion The results showed that the biodiversity impacts vary depending on the assessment method used, with the difference in the dietary impacts being 60-fold in magnitude depending on the method. Most of the impacts were related to land-use change, which was linked especially to production of feeds, leading to the dietary impacts being reduced with intake of foods of animal origin. The occupation impacts were associated with different food groups than those of land-use change and were higher than the land-use change impacts for beverages, and sugars and sweets. Trade played a significant role in biodiversity impacts of diets, with over 85% of impacts being linked to imported foods and feeds.
   Conclusions and recommendations A comparison of the two assessment methods for the biodiversity impact of diet scenarios showed that results obtained with these methods should not be compared in absolute terms. Also, on a product-level basis, the methods lead to different relative results, and the choice of method can affect which products appear the most burdensome. The assessment also showed that land-use change had a greater impact than land occupation. Thus, ignoring the impacts of land-use change, particularly in feed production, might underestimate the contribution of animal-source foods. Hence, both factors should be considered in future LCAs. Further research is also needed to develop and unify the biodiversity impact assessment methods, including the clarification of units, improving the accuracy of land-use change methodology, and analyzing the impacts of various agricultural management practices.

AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) has twenty two Member States with common goals of engaging in European space activities. However, the various Member States have a variety of governance structures, strategic priorities regarding space and other sectorial areas depending on their cultural and geopolitical aspirations. The Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, have similarities which result often in common geopolitical and cultural aspects. These in turn shape their respective priorities and interests in setting up their policies in a number of sectorial areas like shipping and fisheries, energy, immigration, agriculture, security and defence, infrastructures, climate change and the Arctic. Space technology, navigation, earth observation, telecommunication and integrated applications can assist the Nordic countries in developing, implementing and monitoring policies of common interest. This paper provides an in-depth overview and a comprehensive assessment of these common interests in policy areas where space can provide support in their realisation. The first part provides a synthesis of the Nordic countries respective priorities through analysing their government programmes and plans. The priorities are classified according to the six areas of sustainability: energy, environment and climate change, transport, knowledge and innovation, natural resources (fisheries, agriculture, forestry, mining, etc), and security and external relations. Although the national strategies present different national perspectives, at the same time, there are a number of similarities when it comes to overall policy objectives in a number of areas such as the Arctic and climate change. In other words, even though the Arctic plays a different role in each country's national context and there are clear differences as regards geography, access to resources and security policies, the strategies display common general interest in sustainable development and management of resources, protection of the environment, international cooperation and regional security. The second part of this paper focuses on the national space strategies and indicates the main priorities and trends. The priorities vary from one country to the other and can include science, navigation, earth observation, human space flight, launchers, technology development, and/or applications. The motivation for investing in space activities also change (e.g. international cooperation, industrial competitiveness, societal benefits, job creation). (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. The loss of semi-natural grasslands in agro-ecosystems has increased the importance of adequate management of remaining grasslands. Recommendations for intensive grazing have been debated because the effects of different management practices may differ between taxa and species. The increased fragmentation of grasslands suggests that the influence of management practices should be studied in a landscape context.
   2. We studied four groups of flower visitors, many of which are pollinators, bees (Apoidea), butterflies (Lepidoptera), hoverflies (Syrphidae) and beetles (Coleoptera), in semi-natural grasslands managed at three intensity levels in eight areas in central Sweden. Local characteristics of the grasslands were recorded and landscape diversity was quantified. Vegetation height was correlated with grazing intensity: intensive grazing with the shortest vegetation and abandoned grassland with the tallest.
   3. The insect groups responded differently to grazing intensity. Species richness and abundance differed between management regimes for beetles and hoverflies but not for bees and butterflies.
   4. The effects of local habitat and landscape composition on species richness, abundance and composition differed between groups. Bee diversity responded to both local and landscape factors. Butterflies were mainly affected by local vegetation height and linear elements in the landscape. More species of hoverflies were recorded in tall vegetation and in landscapes with high forest cover. Beetles responded only to local environment characteristics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the importance of studying different insect groups simultaneously when evaluating habitat and landscape qualities for diversity. The results suggest that planning for conservation of biodiversity at landscape scales may be better than implementing grazing guidelines for individual grasslands. Grazing intensity should vary within or between landscapes to preserve pollinator diversity. Conservation management to encourage flower visitors cannot be generalized to include all groups simultaneously.

TI  - Case studies of success in nature conservation in Europe
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY: A GLANCE FROM THE VII INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ECOLOGY
LA  - English
CP  - 7th International Congress of Ecology
AB  - The "Case studies of success in nature conservation in Europe" presented at the VII International Congress of Ecology in Florence, Italy, dealt with about 15 endangered species, i.e, several plant species from dry to wet agricultural areas in central and north-western Europe, an endemic plant species of rocky area's in southern France (Centaurea corymbosa), butterflies of England, amphibians of southern Switzerland, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) in Hungary, the Capercaille (Tetrao urogallus) in Sweden, several raptors and the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) in Central Europe and the wolf in Italy. All the species (except C, corymbosa) have been decimated and are threatened by human activity. It is encouraging that, at least in the cases reported, this trend could be reversed and that, thanks to conservation, the abundance of the species increased. The case studies show that for achieving this success it is indispensable for scientists and conservationists to collaborate with farmers, foresters, hunters, civil engineers, and planners. As a basis for this collaboration and also for raising the necessary money, a good flow of information and public relations activities are indispensable. Overall, the case studies and the new instrument of the Blue Lists (lists of the successfully maintained or promoted species of the Red Lists) of northern Switzerland show that conservation is often quite successful. But this fact is not well reflected in the scientific literature and not adequately perceived by the general public and by the decision-makers. From the symposium the following new tasks for ecology and particularly conservation emerged: (1) encourage the scientists and practical conservationists to report about their successes in scientific journals, for the general public and for the decision makers. This is important for spreading the know-how on how to promote threatened species, for improving the sometimes negative image of conservation, and for increasing the motivation of the general public and the decision makers for conservation; (2) elaborate methods for an efficient collaboration of the different disciplines and agencies involved in conservation; (3) develop methods for assessing the effect and efficiency of conservation measures and for monitoring biodiversity in general.

AB  - Following the global concern for the loss of biodiversity, biological knowledge has become a central tool in environmental governance. Science studies has addressed the data-driven nature of biodiversity protection and explored various aspects of it, ranging from knowledge infrastructures to engagement of various social groups in knowledge production. This article focuses on how this knowledge is applied in forestry, one of the most threatening socio-economic practices to biodiversity. Drawing from a case study in Finland, carried out as an ethnography of forestry expert practices, I analyse how biodiversity has been institutionalised in forestry operations. Responsible action and pro-environmental behaviour are much debated topics in environmental governance literature. Here the focus is on how they are articulated and enacted as embedded in the expert practices. The practices and techniques of identifying and locating the biological values are thus not viewed as resources for decision making but as performative of the partnerships in environmental governance, shaping the roles of science, corporations, government and civil society. These partnerships and power relations are constituted by the uncertainty of biological knowledge and the instability of biological objects travelling between the realms of science, administration and economy.

AB  - People's perceptions can point to reasons for conservation support or lack thereof. In this study, we surveyed the perceptions of conservation among local stakeholders who participated in protected area (PA) management following a reform towards community-based conservation in Norway. We analyzed the link between perceptions of threats to conservation values, prioritized management actions and trust in PA governance, and assessed how these perceptions aligned with the stakeholders' preferred overarching conservation approach and their support for PAs. Conservation perceptions differed mostly between property owners and representatives of nature conservation (such as NGOs). Property owners perceived modern farming, grazing and hay making, and securing the interests of rights holders as a priority. They had a lower support for PAs and favored a conservation approach focusing on "people and nature". Representatives from nature conservation prioritized management actions to increase biodiversity and reduce land development, had higher trust in environmental authorities and identified motorized vehicle use as a threat to conservation values. They had a high support for PAs and favored a conservation approach that mitigates threats from human activity (i.e. "nature despite people"). The nationwide reform aimed at increasing support for PAs, but 31% of the members of the stakeholder advisory councils were willing to downgrade or degazette PAs for the benefit of economic development, which is much more than general population surveys. However, the level of trust in local governance was less polarized among the members of stakeholder advisory councils compared with the former state governance, which suggests that that the community-based conservation reform has the potential to improve collaboration and conflict mitigation.

AB  - Intensive forest management has caused loss and fragmentation of old-growth forests and reduced the amount of dead wood throughout northwest Europe. Changes in habitat availability are reflected in occurrence patterns of habitat-specialist species only after a certain time lag. Here we analyse the responses of wood-decomposing fungi and saproxylic beetles inhabiting patches of spruce-swamp forest to habitat quality, loss and isolation at three different spatial scales in eastern Finland and adjacent Russian Karelia, where forestry has been very marginal until recently. Both rare specialist species and common generalist species were included in the study to reveal whether their occurrence patterns differ. Variables describing habitat quality (density and continuity of host trees, patch area) turned out significant in explaining species' incidences (proportion of occupied host trees) in only a few cases, probably because of the relatively high quality of all study patches. Despite this fact, and consistent with our hypothesis, incidences of all the eight specialist species were higher in Russia than Finland, and the difference was significant in the two most strict habitat specialists, Pytho kolwensis and Phlebia centrifuga. In contrast, incidences of three out of four generalist species were higher in Finland than in Russia, and the difference was significant in Rhagium inquisitor. In a subset of 21 patches in Finland, we used a metapopulation model to predict the probability of each patch to be currently occupied by a species given the known spatiotemporal distribution of suitable forest stands during the last 50 years. The degree of isolation alone explained significantly the incidences of five species. However, including habitat variables into the models altered some of the effects. Moreover, inconsistent with our hypothesis, isolation appeared to also negatively affect some very common generalist species. Inclusion of these species in the study disclosed that apparently significant effects of spatiotemporal isolation should be interpreted cautiously.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes have become more intensive and monotonous, which may further increase biodiversity loss. Even though Finnish rural landscapes are often heterogeneous, crop choices and rotations lack diversity. The aim of this study was to develop an interactive, multi-step crop rotation tool, which acknowledges farmer's preferences in land allocation for different crops depending on farm and field parcel characteristics. The tool was developed to provide as diverse a 5-year crop rotation plan as possible on the field parcel scale for the farmer's consideration. The tool is flexible and interactive in the sense that it allows a farmer to include or exclude crops and spatially and temporally rearrange them to improve farming logistics. The tool was tested in southern-western Finland with the highest potential for diverse crop choices and sequencing. Test-runs indicated that the tool was powerful in proposing diversified crop rotations: the shares of current monotonous cereal-based rotations collapsed. The final diversification plan always lies in the farmer's hands, who may exclude crop choices and even end up in cereal monoculture rotations. The tool provides estimates on farm economics for each step of the planning process. The tool will be available for all Finnish farmers (similar to 48,000) on the EconomyDoctor-portal with personal access only and the background information is automatically updated annually.

AB  - In the north-western European countries Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland.. variability in the forms, amounts and timing of phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural land is related to national differences in climate, soil, hydrological conditions and agricultural production. The dissolved form of P constitutes 9-93/,, of the total phosphorus (TP) in water, subsurface drainage can contribute 12-60% and surface erosion 40-88% of TP transfer. TP export in small agricultural streams is generally in the range 0.3-6 kg ha(-1) year(-1), with the highest losses in Norway and UK. All four countries are complying with the EU Water Framework Directive and developing a range of measures based on P source with transport controls over P losses. A decreasing trend in TP losses has been detected in agricultural streams following the introduction of measures to reduce erosion in Norway. Average P concentrations in Swedish streams have shown a reduction of nearly 2%, per year since 1993 as a result of measures introduced in southern Sweden. However, in two large rivers in agricultural regions of Sweden, the concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and TP were shown to increase by 0.4% and 0.7% per year, respectively, over the period 1975-2004, possibly as a result of climate change. It is too early to detect trends in agricultural contributions to P in surface waters as a result of catchment-sensitive farming (CSF) in the UK and Ireland.

AB  - Integrated coastal zone planning seeks to balance competing interests, with aquaculture representing an increasing pressure fuelled by a dominant discourse of 'blue growth'. Recently, more regional-level approaches to planning and mapping in the coastal zone have emerged. Maps, however, are not neutral artefacts, but are infused with particular values and meanings, strengthening some interests rather than others. Drawing on a case study from Hordaland in western Norway, we demonstrate how mapping came to play a pivotal role in regional coastal planning - through analysing relevant documents and interviews, we explored how the conflicts between aquaculture and environmental concerns were explicitly visualised and brought to the fore through mapping. This triggered latent conflicts between the local and regional levels of governance, with several municipalities contesting the map. We suggest that the practice of mapping served to strengthen the authority of the regional planning body in mediating between conflicting interests.

AB  - Biodiversity elements with narrow niches and restricted distributions (i.e., 'short range endemics,' SREs) are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The New Mexico Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi obscurus, CWO), an SRE listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act within three sky islands of southwestern North America, is constrained at low elevation by drought and at high elevation by wildfire. We combined long-term recapture and molecular data with demographic and niche modeling to gauge its climate-driven status, distribution, and projected longevity. The largest population (Animas) is numerically constricted (N = 151), with few breeding adults (N-b = 24) and an elevated inbreeding coefficient (Delta F = 0.77; 100 years). Mean home range (0.07km(2)) is significantly smaller compared to other North American rattlesnakes, and movements are within, not among sky islands. Demographic values, when gauged against those displayed by other endangered/Red-Listed reptiles [e.g., Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta)], are either comparable or markedly lower. Survival rate differs significantly between genders (female<male) and life history stages (juvenile<adult) while a steadily declining population trajectory (r = -0.20 +/- 0.03) underscores the shallow predicted-time-to-extinction (17.09 +/- 2.05 years). Core habitat is receding upwards in elevation and will shift 750km NW under conservative climate estimates. While survival is significantly impacted by wildfire at upper elevations, the extinction vortex is driven by small population demographics, a situation comparable to that of the European Adder (Vipera berus), a conservation icon in southern Sweden. Genetic rescue, a management approach successfully employed in similar situations, is ill advised in this situation due to climate-driven habitat change in the sky islands. CWO is a rare organism in a unique environment, with a conserved niche and a predisposition towards extinction. It is a bellwether for the eventual climate-driven collapse of the Madrean pine-oak ecosystem, one of Earth's three recognized megadiversity centers.

AB  - The expansion of the Norwegian aquaculture industry has generated a need for balancing aquaculture with other societal interests in the coastal zone.The interactions, conflicts and synergies of different uses of a Norwegian coastal region heavily influenced by large-scale salmonid aquaculture was analyzed and mapped by means of systematic stakeholder participatory approach and a GIS-based spatial interaction analysis tool, SEAGRID. Our study focused on spatial conflicts/ synergies, whereas non-spatial interactions were taken into account in order to elucidate the spatial effects.The questionnaire analysis showed that there was a large agreement across the respondents that aquaculture and fisheries compete for access to sea areas, which is also in agreement with the SEAGRID analysis. All but one of the interviewees thought that conservation issues will become more important in the future. We found that societal interests and infrastructure obstruct or displace private enterprises and economic interests, whereas environmental protection measures do so to a lesser extent; an exception are coral reefs which seem to be well protected against both fishing operations as well as new aquaculture facilities. Nature protection was not found to affect fisheries nor aquaculture to a large extent, with the exception of the single salmon fjord, which is protected from salmonid aquaculture, but otherwise open to other activities, such as fisheries, tourist fisheries and tourism in general. The restricted military areas had a limited extent, and were not viewed as a cause of conflicts.Stakeholder consultations, like our participatory GIS approach, combined with GIS-based tools for analysis of spatial conflicts/synergies may be useful in identifying areas where aquaculture production can increase with little increase in degree of conflict with fisheries, although some interactions are not strictly spatial. Our results indicated a certain degree of mistrust of management authorities since neither fishermen nor aquaculturists perceived that their own sector was given priority by management authorities, but thought the other sector was prioritized.

AB  - Waterfront areas in cities are subject to constant changes. The desire to integrate the transformed waterside areas with the urban fabric involves shaping high-quality public spaces related to water, which are often referred to as urban blue spaces (UBS). The aim of the research was to examine the transformation processes of urban waterfront areas in the Baltic Sea Region and identify emerging transition models and types of blue public spaces. The methodological framework of this study is based on qualitative analysis of urban form with respect to coastal and riverine waters. An introductory analysis of 50 cases of transformations was conducted, and 12 were selected for further investigation: Tallinn, Parnu (Estonia), Copenhagen, Koge, Aarhus (Denmark), Helsinki, Turku (Finland), Stockholm, Malmo, Lulea, Sundsvall, and Ystad (Sweden). As the outcome of the study, the authors indicate that the existing hard land-water interfaces were transformed into soft transition zones where new types of blue public spaces were created with different relationships to water. Synergies were identified between public space design, flood protection measures, and climate adaptation schemes. Finally, the findings highlight the need to verify the existing planning regulations and make them more flexible and effective in guiding the sustainable waterfront design processes.

AB  - Land-use environmental impacts are gaining attention as global demand for land is increasing. Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) is a useful measure to estimate how much of the net primary production (NPP) available for ecosystem processes is appropriated by humans annually. It accounts for the NPP extracted by biomass harvest, and the NPP losses due to land conversion. Finland is a forested country with good availability of detailed data for calculating HANPP. We estimated HANPP for Finland for a period from 1990 to 2010. Human appropriation of net primary production in Finland was on average 59% of the potential net primary production during the 1990' s and then decreased fairly steadily to 50% in 2010. Net primary production harvested by humans, HANPP(harv), remained fairly constant over the study period, on average 25 Mt carbon. HANPP due to land use change (HANPP(luc)) decreased from 50 Mt to 38 Mt carbon during the past 20 years. The difference between the actual NPP of forests and the potential NPP without any human intervention decreased, mainly due to the growth of wood biomass stock in forests yielding larger amounts of litter production and further larger NPP. Forest HANPP(luc), however contributed as much as 50% of the Finnish total HANPP in 2010. Our study shows for the first time the importance of calculating potential NPP for forests in detail.

AB  - A plethora of new concepts for managing production forests so as to preserve biodiversity have found their way into management procedures without much testing to make them most effective. The general framework fur a new approach has. in most regions. been ecosystem management, although small reserves are still used. as in the Swedish keg; habitat sites. Ecosystem management usually entails a focus on processes rather than on species directly. and the key processes in boreal forests are almost always seen as disturbances. Further. although such disturbances as insect and pathogen outbreaks. windstorms, and snow avalanches can be crucial, the concern has been almost wholly with fire. The idea that production forestry should mimic natural disturbance (fire) regimes is a step in the right direction but too simplistic. What needs to be determined is exactly which aspects of natural disturbance regimes are important to which species. Because different types of disturbance interact with one another. understanding the impacts on biodiversity of complex disturbance regimes will require experiments on a scale relevant to regional conservation. as well as intensive monitoring. So far. the effort on experimentation and monitoring is not nearly sufficient to generate detailed management prescriptions, although many management procedures already in place (e.g., retention of green trees and coarse woody debris) are probably useful.

AB  - Protection of vulnerable species often creates conflicts between land use and conservation management. Particularly challenging is the case of Siberian flying squirrel (SFS; Pteromys volans). SFS favours mature forest habitats, which are often the target for logging, and therefore its protection causes opportunity costs. In our analysis a regional case study was applied as a platform to create alternative forest management scenarios. These scenarios aimed to maintain and improve SFS habitats with varying magnitudes, from no action in SFS habitat improvement to increasing the amount of suitable habitat for SFS. Stand projections for each forest management scenario were modelled with the Motti stand simulator, and the simulated stand structures were further analyzed using specific indexes with Geographic Information System (GIS) methodologies and tools to predict potential nesting and feeding habitats and connectivity for SFS. Connectivity between habitats was assessed with a Least Cost Path analysis. The results showed that some forest management scenarios were more cost-efficient than others in maintaining habitat suitability and connectivity for SFS. Further, with adjusted cutting removals (due to restrictions other than SFS habitat related, mainly recreation) an additional hectare suitable for SFS habitat was considerably more cost-efficient than without the adjustment.

AB  - This final paper of the series discusses implications of various aspects of using clones in forestry. Benefits from using clones are considerable. A large benefit arises from the ability to deploy genetic gain much sooner than is possible through conventional seed orchards. This benefit applies even to the use of clones to implement family forestry, even though the clones themselves are not tested. The requirement for genetic diversity at both the stand and landscape levels requires active management to ensure that diversity is conserved. This is achieved partly through the management of breeding populations, as well as by managing the genetic diversity and number of genotypes deployed in clone mixtures. A numerical example is given comparing diversity of clone and seed orchard deployment over time. Many aspects of managing concerns about using clones are about communication to clarify public perceptions and establishing a code of practice.

AB  - The specialized fauna of peat bogs declines strongly both in species numbers and population density and becomes fragmented because of anthropogenic land use changes. We investigated 15 populations of the stenotopic ground beetle species Agonum ericeti in south Sweden to address the question of reduced genetic variability in populations inhabiting smaller habitat patches. Our results reveal a generally low differentiation and a significant positive relationship between habitat size and allelic richness.

AB  - Slow and complicated wind power planning and permitting procedures have been a large obstacle for wind power diffusion in Sweden and other countries. This paper complements previous siting-oriented literature with a planning perspective on these problems. The focus is two national planning instruments implemented in Sweden in the early 2000s: a national planning target and an appointment of areas of national interest for wind power. The paper identifies different types of conflicts of interest related to wind power - in addition to the conflict between wind power as a national public interest and various local private interests - and analyses the impact of the national planning instruments on the handling of these conflicts in the land-use planning process in the County of Ostergotland. The analysis shows that the planning target actually made local planning officials even more inclined to treat wind power as a private rather than a public interest and that the method used to identify areas of national interest of wind power forced wind power to compete with the combined strengths of all other public interest. The planning instruments thus left wind power to fight an uphill battle rather than to meet other interests face-to-face on a level playing field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Landscape Convention encourages everyone to be part of the management and perception of the landscape. In Swedish forestry today, however, it is experts in biodiversity who are responsible for the management policies used when planning tree retention as a biodiversity conservation strategy. This gives the forest a certain structure, but it is uncertain whether this structure is felt to represent the same biodiversity when assessed by novices rather than biodiversity experts. Using eye tracking and subjective assessment scales, the present study investigates whether biodiversity expertise has an effect on biodiversity rating and its certainty, fixation durations, and dwell times in the field layer in the foreground when assessing images of recently logged forest that has some degree of tree retention. The results show no significant difference in the assessments of the images between the two groups; however, the certainty assessments and the eye-tracking data suggest that there are differences in strategies and behaviour. The findings have implications for the interpretation of self-reported data corresponding to measured behaviour when judging the biodiversity of a forest landscape. The study suggest that there could be differences between user groups that previous studies miss out on, and that eye tracking as a method could help detect these differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During urban planning, city planners and municipal authorities make various choices that impact districts' energy efficiency and emissions significantly. However, they often lack information about the actual effects of the design options. This paper describes a methodology, embedded to a tool called Kurke, that aims to support the planning of sustainable and energy efficient urban areas by analysing the energy performance of city plans and the impacts of their energy design alternatives on carbon dioxide emissions during planning. The methodology supports holistic energy analysis of urban areas, including energy demand of buildings and transport, and comparing 10 alternatives for local energy supply. The methodology is tested in two Finnish residential and mixed-use areas. The improved transportation plans can reduce CO2 emissions 10-20% compared to the business-as-usual design in case areas. CO2 emissions from buildings' heating can be reduced 18-24%. The total CO2 reduction potential of urban planning choices varies from 2% to 78% in case areas. This shows the significant role of urban planning in reducing CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is important that urban planners understand the impacts of the design decisions. Kurke tool offers such support with fast and practical evaluation of the planning options.

AB  - Finnish agriculture is likely to undergo major changes in the near and intermediate future. The future policy context can be examined at a general level by strategic scenario building. Computer-based modelling in combination with agricultural policy scenarios can in turn create a basis for the assessments of changes in environmental quality following possible changes in Finnish agriculture. The analysis of economic consequences is based on the DREMFIA model, which is applied to Study effects of various agricultural policies on land use, animal production, and farmers' income. The model is suitable for an impact analysis covering an extended time span - here up to the year 2015. The changes in land use, obtained with the DREMFIA model assuming rational economic behaviour, form the basis when evaluating environmental impacts of different agricultural policies. The environmental impact assessment is performed using the field scale nutrient transport model ICECREAM. The modelled variables are nitrogen and phosphorus losses in surface runoff and percolation. In this paper the modelling strategy will be presented and highlighted using two case study catchments with varying environmental conditions and land use as an example. In addition, the paper identifies issues arising when connecting policy scenarios with impact modelling.

AB  - A tax-fund system has been proposed to advance Swedish forest conservation. We present a choice experiment with Swedish private forest owners on preferences for attributes of a tax-fund system. Focusing on three aspects: (i) freedom to choose set-asides, (ii) equity issues, and (iii) frequency of nature inventories, we find two groups of forest owners. The first is opposed to interventions that could curtail liberty and oppose frequent nature inventories, while a smaller group would derive positive utility from jointly deciding on the location of set-asides with society. Both groups have a preference for changing the current tax-base to soil productivity or timber volume. The tax-base chosen together with the modalities of re-distributing the funds will determine the program's efficiency. The paper concludes that a tax-fund system could indeed be a way forward but would need to be designed in a participatory manner to reconcile forest owners, forest industry representatives, and conservationists.

AB  - The boreal rainforest in Central Norway is rich in rare and (or) red-listed epiphytic lichens but is subject to forest harvesting. Natural old Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. forests have been replaced increasingly by dense, even-aged plantations. This study aims at increasing our knowledge about populations of old forest associated lichens in P. abies plantations. In differently aged plantations, we measured occurrence of six lichen species and the population size and reproductive effort of :five lichen species. We found that the success of colonizing plantations differed because of species-specific constraints and needs, and that species occurrence depended on stand age and branch quality. A high number of reproducing thalli and small juvenile thalli of the cyanolichen Lobaria scrobiculata (Scop.) DC. and the pendulous lichen Ramalina thrausta (Ach.) Nyl. suggest effective recruitment within plantations. The populations of the cyanolichens Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. and Pseudocphellaria crocata (L.) Vain, were too small to be viable and demand special concern to survive in managed forests. The abundance of old forest associated lichens in a managed boreal rainforest could be promoted by a varied and heterogeneous branch structure, increased rotation periods (increase the value of plantations as propagule sources), small clearcuts and retention trees (shorten the distance between sources of propagules and target substrate), and maintaining Salix and Sorbus trees (important host trees for cyanolichens and thereby important dispersal sources).

AB  - Uneven-aged silviculture may better maintain species assemblages associated with old-growth forests than clear felling in part due to habitat heterogeneity created by maintaining standing retention strips adjacent to harvest trails. Retention strips and harvest trails created at the time of tree removal will likely have different microclimate and may harbor different assemblages. In some cases, the resultant stand heterogeneity associated with uneven-aged silviculture may be similar to natural small-scale disturbances. For beetles, increased light and temperature as well as potential access to young vegetation and deadwood substrates present in harvset trails may harbor beetle assemblages similar to those found in natural gaps. We sampled saproxylic beetles using flight intercept traps placed in harvest corridors and retention strips in 9 replicated uneven-aged spruce stands in central Sweden. We compared abundance, species richness and composition between harvest corridors and retention strips using generalized linear models, rarefaction, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and indicator species analysis. Canopy openness doubled, mean temperature and variability in daily temperature increased and humidity decreased on harvest trails. Beetle richness and abundance were greater in harvests trails than in retention strips and the beetle species composition differed significantly between habitats. Twenty-five species were associated with harvest trails, including three old-growth specialists such as Agathidium discoideum (Erichson), currently red-listed. We observed only one species, Xylechinus pilosus (Ratzeburg) that strongly favored retention strips. Harvest trails foster both open habitat species and old-growth species while retention strips harbored forest interior specialists. The combination of closed canopy, stratified forest in the retention strips and gap-like conditions on the harvest trails thus increases overall species richness and maintains more diverse assemblages at the stand level than would otherwise be seen in less heterogeneous stand types. This suggests that uneven-aged silviculture may provide added conservation benefits for both open habitat and old-growth specialists than silvicultural approaches that reduce stand heterogeneity.

AB  - Crop raiding ungulates can cause costly yield losses and conflicts between agriculture, game management, and conservation. It is therefore crucial to know how, where, and when ungulates use different habitats and crops. In this study we used resource selection functions and GPS-tagged red deer Cervus elaphus (n = 38) in two different study areas (North - mainly forested land and South - mainly arable land), to investigate how red deer use arable land and different crop types in relation to availability and distance to forest cover in Sweden. Our study shows a transitional use of arable land and forests by red deer. Red deer spend on average 45% and 21% of their time in arable land in South and North respectively. In the North, arable land was selected while forest and wetlands were selected in the South. The selection of different crops also differed between the two study areas, for example rapeseed was highly selected during both seasons in South while it was used to a lower degree in relation to its availability in the North. In both study areas the probability of red deer presence on the agricultural fields decreased with distance to forest. The significant use of arable land and unharvested crops by the increasing red deer population in Sweden highlights a risk for crop damage that may need further consideration for farming practices as well as for damage and wildlife management. In our case damage mitigation should focus on rapeseed in the South, whereas there is a less clear pattern of selection among growing crops in the North. The differences in habitat and crop selection between the two areas also highlights the need of knowledge about red deer habitat selection at a regional level to be able to adapt damage mitigation and wildlife management strategies accordingly. Moreover, the transitional use of arable land and forests by red deer in mixed landscapes may imply that consumption of certain crops can affect browsing patterns and damage levels within forests and vice versa, that may have implication for both agriculture and forestry and calls for future studies.

AB  - Traffic accidents between cars and wildlife cause loss of lives, suffering and economic loss. Many studies have quantified the characteristics of accident sites, but factors affecting wildlife behaviour near roads and traffic are less explored. Hence, the mechanisms affecting animal movement and collision risks are poorly understood. Previous work suggests that roads and traffic may alter the behaviour of many animals, with temporal and spatial effects on daily movements, migration patterns and land cover selection. Here we analyze data from GPS-collared female wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Sweden to study factors affecting road crossings and traffic accidents involving wild boar. Our results show that wild boar cross roads in habitats mainly used for foraging. Avoidance of traffic results in few accidents at high traffic levels, causing most accidents to occur at intermediate traffic levels. A conclusion from this study is that wild boar appears to be able to make behavioural adjustments that reduce the risk of close vehicle encounters. Applications of these results for mitigating accidents between wild boar and vehicles involve changes in behavioural patterns of drivers and changes in farming practices close to accident prone roads.

AB  - Floristic diversity in 21 small short-rotation poplar plantations, 0.1 to 13 ha in size and aged 6 to 14 yr, was compared with adjacent agricultural fields of various crop types. The poplars were grown on former agricultural land and most of the study sites were located in southern and central Sweden. Surveys of ground vegetation were carried out by using nested quadrats (plots of 0.25 and 0.016 m(2) size) located along normally five transects running perpendicular to the habitat boundaries. Mean cumulative species number across all sites (all transects and plots included) was around 20 and similar in poplar stands and arable fields. However, the two habitat types shared only 3 to 12 species (mean: 8 species). Mean species number per survey plot was 4.5 in poplar stands compared to 5.3 in arable fields. Classification (TWINSPAN) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) showed some floristic separation of the two habitat types. The results were interpreted in a landscape context. Mainly based on the low quantity of species shared by poplar stands and adjacent arable fields, the results support the hypothesis that small-scale poplar plantations increase floristic diversity in landscapes dominated by agriculture. Compared to old-growth mixed deciduous forests in different regions of Sweden, species richness of poplar plantations was similar or lower.

AB  - Valuable cultural landscapes are challenging to sustain. They are usually rare and reflect unique histories of nature-human interactions. We have studied the influence of environmental factors on the present distribution, age and abundance of oaks in a unique forest site in south-western Finland. The Landscape Change Trajectory Analysis (LCTA) approach was tested to improve management strategies at a local level. We used geospatial analysis in GIS on existing data from a recent forest inventory, a multi-temporal land cover/land use analysis, and a digital elevation model. The results show that mature Pendunculate oaks (Quercus robur) are restricted to the eastern parts of Ruissalo island and their present abundance patterns can be linked with change trajectories as opposed to physical conditions. While the prevailing strategy of strict protection seems to lead to an increasing amount of dead wood, the lack of management hampers the regeneration of oaks. We suggest four principles for future management of these sites that could be applied throughout the hemiboreal region of Europe with similar historical development: (1) management regimes should be spatially explicit in terms of land cover history instead of treating valuable oak biotopes as one homogenous unit: (2) management units should be determined by biotope dynamics and development rattler than present status and distribution; (3) management should allow strict protection of sites with long duration of protection and high abundance of decaying oak wood to support biodiversity; (4) alternative management regimes should be introduced in sites with high potential for re-establishment of light-abundant favourable conditions.

AB  - Impacts of bioeconomy on climate have been much discussed, but less attention has been given to biodiversity deterioration. One approach to assess biodiversity impacts is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Finland is a forested country with intensive forest industries, but only coarse biodiversity LCA methods are available. The aim of this study was to further develop and apply approaches to assess the biodiversity impacts of wood use in Finland. With the species richness approach (all taxons included), biodiversity impacts were higher in Southern than in Northern Finland but impacts in Southern and Northern Finland were lower when mammals, birds and molluscs were included. With the ecosystem indicators approach, if the reference situation were forest in its natural state, biodiversity impacts were higher than in the case where the initial state of forest before final felling was used to derive biodiversity loss. In both cases, the biodiversity impacts were higher in Northern Finland. These results were not coherent as the model applying species richness data assesses biodiversity loss based on all species, whereas the ecosystem indicators approach considers vulnerable species. One limitation of the species richness approach was that there were no reliable datasets available. In the ecosystem indicators approach, it was noticed that the biodiversity of managed Finnish forests is substantially lower than in natural forests. Biodiversity LCA approaches are highly sensitive to reference states, applied model and data. It is essential to develop approaches capable of comparing biodiversity impacts of forest management practices, or when looking at multiple environmental impacts simultaneously with the LCA framework.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in forests but conservation measures to increase CWD must be performed cost efficiently. We estimate least-cost combinations of CWD-increasing measures in a spruce-dominated Swedish forest estate. Specifically, we investigate how using combinations of the measures tree retention, creating high stumps, manual scarification, prolonged rotations, and retention of dying trees impacts the amount of CWD and net present value at the estate level. We found that by combining CWD-increasing measures in an optimal way the amount of CWD on the estate could be increased 322% with a decrease in present value of only 10%. The optimal combination of conservation measures depends on the desired increase in CWD.

AB  - Part of the Vega archipelago in north-western Norway is a cultural landscape listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its buffer zone comprises most of the main island of Vega, where agriculture is an important land use. The authors describe interdisciplinary research carried out in the buffer zone. The research revealed the significant role of agriculture for the maintenance of the traditional open coastal landscape. The finding was further underlined by the fact that many visitors to the site never reach the outer archipelago, which is the core of the listed site. Based on interpretations of aerial photographs, land cover maps were produced for three cross-sections in time (1965, 1986, and 2009). A further reclassification of the land cover was performed to capture the change in openness due to change in land cover. Viewshed maps of each building found on the aerial photographs were overlain with the openness classes to capture the visual consequences of the buildings due to changes in land cover. A marked decrease in open land surrounding the buildings was found in the study area, which comprised Holand and Floa-Kjul in Vega Municipality, which in turn comprises the islands of the Vega archipelago. The regrowth of the land seemed to be happening regardless of building category.

AB  - Urban-based nature conservation elites often condemn rural communities as backwards when they appeal to the value of tradition. Nevertheless, drawing from an interview study of Swedish hunters, we show that appeals to tradition express a coherent, if problematic, philosophical vision. We ask, then, two questions: (1) Do the ideas of Swedish hunters reflect a coherent philosophical vision? (2) Could this vision have a positive function in facilitating improved public dialogue over conservation policy? We examine this overlooked phenomenon of philosophical beliefs as the basis for contesting conservation policy. We also elucidate the negative consequences of this oversight for nature conservation policy debates. Finally, we discuss its positive function in nature conservation policy-making. Overall, we argue that policymakers should strive for a better understanding and appreciation of the hunters' philosophical vision and that the hunters themselves should strive to better articulate this vision rather than their resentments.

AB  - Serbian spruce (Picea omorika Pancic) Purk.) is tertiary relict and endemic species with restricted and fragmented natural range in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly around the mid-course of the Drina river. Serbian spruce has been on The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List (IUCN) of Threatened Species since 1998. In the beginning it was marked as a vulnerable species and since 2010 as an endangered species. Serbian spruce is a tree species which has a wide ecological aspect in relation to the basic ecological factors, and the forest associations that were the subject of this research are among the most valuable forest associations in the region. The research described in this paper conducted with an aim to define the type of forests that contain Serbian spruce as an edifier in the area of mountain Radava in the Republic of Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in order to genetically preserve this rare and endangered tree species from the Balkans. Based on the research of ecological factors of habitats and the definition of production stand characteristics, the production type of forest was singled out - Forest type of European beech, silver fir, Norway spruce and Serbian spruce (Piceo omorikae-Abietetum[5]) on a series of soils on limestone.

AB  - Forest landscapes provide benefits from a wide range of goods, function and intangible values. But what are different forest owner categories' profiles of economic use and non-use values? This study focuses on the complex forest ownership pattern of the River Helge Ayen catchment including the Kristianstad Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve in southern Sweden. We made 89 telephone interviews with informants representing the four main forest owner categories. Our mapping included consumptive and non-consumptive direct use values, indirect use values, and non-use values such as natural and cultural heritage. While the value profiles of non-industrial forest land owners and municipalities included all value categories, the forest companies focused on wood production, and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency on nature protection. We discuss the challenges of communicating different forest owners' economic value profiles among stakeholders, the need for a broader suite of forest management systems, and fora for collaborative planning.

AB  - In recent decades, the land use changes induced by various economic activities in agricultural ecosystems have affected many aspects of human life. This is the reason why land use change is considered as one of the agriculture-related environmental impacts in a sustainability assessment of food and bio-based products. At the same time, the methodology applied for the quantification of land use change effects is still under intensive research, stimulating scientific discussions. The overall objective of this paper is to fill the gap in knowledge of responsible and sustainable land use management. Specifically, the research provides a comprehensive set of land use change indicators in the context of land use change and land use efficiency. The indicators can be measured based on publicly available databases with the applicability to agricultural sustainability assessment of land use change on a local, regional and global scale. The high share of artificial land and dominant agricultural use of land with low land use intensity were noted in Belgium, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Slovenia, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Germany, and United Kingdom. However, land use efficiency was also low. In turn, heterogeneous land cover (but less artificial areas than in other EU countries) and heterogeneous land uses with diverse land use intensity were noted in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden. The challenge in future research could be aggregation of different indicators in assessing the similarity of land use between countries.

AB  - This paper examines the historical phases of Finnish forest planning from the 1960s to the present day in support of the rational future development of forest planning for family-owned forest holdings. The 'historical types' of work-craft work, mass production, process enhancement, and mass customization have been recognized in the Finnish planning discourse to date. Indications of mass customization are typical in the present developmental discussion of forest planning. There are some signals in the current planning debate that are calling for the next activity principle, co-configuration. A forthcoming type of forestry extension activity, labelled adaptive planning, is described in this paper to explicate the demands imposed by a future planning system. The present analysis informs also other contexts outside of Finland, where public and private institutions that support family forest owners face post-industrial challenges.

AB  - An aim for conservation in Norway is preserving the Svalbard archipelago as one of the least disturbed areas in the Arctic. Information on local distribution, population sizes and ecology is summarized for 20 thermophilous vascular plant species. The need for conservation of northern, marginal populations in Svalbard is reviewed, using World Conservation Union categories and criteria at a regional scale. Thirteen species reach their northernmost distribution in Svalbard, the remaining seven in the western Arctic. Nine species have 1 - 8 populations in Svalbard and are assigned to Red List categories endangered or critically endangered: Campanula rotundifolia, Euphrasia frigida, Juncus castaneus, Kobresia simpliciuscula, Rubus chamaemorus, Alchemilla glomerulans, Ranunculus wilanderi, Salix lanata and Vaccinium uliginosum, the last four species needing immediate protective measures. Five species are classified as vulnerable: Betula nana, Carex marina ssp. pseudolagopina, Luzula wahlenbergii, Ranunculus arcticus and Ranunculus pallasii. Six species are considered at lower risk: Calamagrostis stricta, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, Hippuris vulgaris (only occurring on Bjornoya), Juncus triglumis, Ranunculus lapponicus and Rhodiola rosea. The warmer Inner Arctic Fjord Zone of Spitsbergen supports most of the 20 target species and is of particular importance for conservation. Endangered or vulnerable species were found in a variety of edaphic conditions; thus, several kinds of habitats need protection.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a key biodiversity issue in forest planning at the landscape level. More consideration is needed in assessing the choice of the landscape index in spatial forest planning optimizations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of four different landscape indices on the fragmentation when applied to forest planning optimization problems. The indices were included in a long-term planning problem from a case study area in Northern Sweden, with both timber production and biodiversity goals. The results show that different spatial indices affect the landscape structure differently and that the effect of the index is very dependent on the available area of habitat. For mean distance between patches and shape index, for example, very good index values were achieved, but at the cost of total area of habitat. Moreover, the optimization algorithm chose small and regular-shaped patches, which had a positive effect on the index value, but a negative impact on the overall fragmentation pattern. This is an important result for the practical application of landscape indices to forest planning situations: by only tracking the numerical changes in landscape configuration, the detrimental effects of the optimization setup on fragmentation as a whole may be overlooked.

AB  - The effects of circular economy on biodiversity are poorly understood. This study provides observations on approaches for assessing circular economy and illustrates, with a Finnish case study, the potential of circular economy to mitigate pressures on biodiversity. The case study focuses on the construction and real estate sectors, as well as the forest industry. The findings imply that circular economy actions that reduce the extraction of virgin raw materials and relieve land use pressures are effective. Improving material efficiency, increasing the cascading use of wood, and optimizing the use and reuse of materials and products, as well as extending the lifetime of buildings and optimizing space use, have good potential for mitigating pressures on biodiversity in Finland. However, as forest utilization has a major impact on Finnish biodiversity, certain actions that possibly increase the use of forest resources (e.g., replacing fossil-based, concrete, or steel materials with wood-based solutions) may impair biodiversity if biodiversity-enhancing forest management practices are not utilized. Assessing the biodiversity impacts of circular economy is challenging, and the need for further research and the development of indicators and assessment methods is clear.

AB  - The potential impact of climatic change on bird species' distributions in Europe was recently modeled for several scenarios of projected late 21st century climate. The results indicate mean range shifts of hundreds of kilometres north for many of European bird species. Here we consider the implications from such distributional shifts for the bird communities of Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures in southern Sweden, a forest type likely to remain prevalent due to forestry, despite climate change. Our assessment led us to three key findings. First, the monocultures offer suitable habitat to only two bird species projected to extend their breeding distribution northwards into southern Sweden this century. Second, species richness was projected to decline overall, which would accentuate the depauperate nature of these stands. Third, all conifer-associated arboreal granivores and three of four conifer-associated arboreal insectivores were projected not to occur, reducing both the functional richness and functional redundancy. We discuss caveats related to our approach, including the potential for bioclimatic projections - used in this study - to be hampered by the artificial retention of dominant vegetation. We also discuss the implications of our results for avian biodiversity in what is today the most prevalent forest type in southern Sweden and in many other regions of Europe.

TI  - Strategic multiresource planning of a Swedish boreal forest landscape
T2  - FOREST SCENARIO MODELLING FOR ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT AT LANDSCAPE LEVEL
LA  - English
CP  - International Seminar and Summer School on Forest Scenario Modelling for Ecosystem Management at Landscape Level
AB  - In strategic planning of timber production, long-term production potential is sought after. Therefore, planning is preferably based on unbiased data of known precision provided by objective (probability sampling) inventories. Sample plots are located in a grid, in tracts, or in sample stands in the forest area. The sampling procedure can also provide data for individual trees, thus improving the likelihood of good projections. For strategic planning of timber production, spatial aspects have only moderate impact; consequently, samples and nonspatial analyses are sufficient.
   However, concern about non-timber forest resources has increased in the last few decades. For many of these resources, spatial aspects are more important than they are for timber production alone. For example, the spatial distribution of habitats is a significant factor in maintaining biodiversity in managed landscapes. This makes strategic multiresource forest management planning based on traditional samples of plots or stands inappropriate.
   In this study, different management plans were designed aiming at both timber production and maintaining biodiversity in a boreal Swedish forest landscape (of approximately 10 000 ha). The planning procedure was based on timber production data from the stand register and from an inventory of a stratified sample of stands (i.e. acquired by subjective and objective methods respectively) and a survey of nature conservation values. Both timber production outcomes and effects on biodiversity were evaluated. In the different alternative plans, various silvicultural treatments, e.g. thinning regimes, extended rotation ages, prescribed burning, and protected forest, were applied in different areas. The net present value of timber production was maximised under the different management alternatives. This paper describes the procedure for creating a flexible planning process, achieved by delineating areas designated for specific silvicultural treatments in a geographic information system (GIS), overlaying of these maps with the forest map, and creating new strata (i.e. after the field inventory) and artificial sample stands.

AB  - In global imaginaries, wilderness areas are considered to represent the last parts of "original" nature, untouched by civilization and modernization. In most cases, this is misleading as wilderness environments have been exploited, explored and also converted into administrative units in various protected area networks. Indeed, most wilderness areas have been a part of human-environment interactions for a long time and they have been influenced and modified in that interaction. As a result, wilderness is constitutively a cultural and politically loaded idea. While the Western notion of wilderness as a place where "man himself is a visitor who doesn't remain" represents the global hegemonic conservation thinking, it does not necessarily work with different local realities, meanings and use values of "the wild". In addition, in recent decades, the tourism industry has placed an increasing interest on nature-based and adventure tourism products creating new kinds of ideas and use needs for the remaining wilderness environments. This paper analyzes empirically how wilderness environments and their roles are seen in the context of new and traditional anthropogenic uses and meanings of wilderness areas. More specifically, the paper uses a political ecology approach to evaluate the use and management priorities in the Finnish Wilderness system.

AB  - Background Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is key to the success of public transport and for sustainable urban and regional development. Previous research has often focused on delivering TOD in urban areas with high population and building densities. This highlights the need to broaden the scope of TOD approaches to also include less densely populated areas located outside the immediate urban cores as a key concern for policy. Purpose The aim of this paper is to increase the knowledge of how to deliver TOD in such low-density contexts. Methods Three case studies of attempts at delivering TOD in sparsely populated areas in three Swedish city-regions are made. The data for the case studies consist of planning documents and 13 interviews with key stakeholders involved in the planning processes of the three cases. Results The results show that many of the barriers and enablers are rather similar to those identified in research on TOD in much more urban contexts in other parts of the world, but the relationships between them are differently nuanced in low-density contexts. The lack of clear quantified definitions of what TOD is (or is not) allows a more flexible, site-specific understanding of TOD to emerge in this context. Results It is important that a shared vision of TOD in each location is developed by the organizations involved-and such a shared vision appears to be crucial for the development to have a good chance of being delivered. Informal definitions, and individual perceptions (including those of the public) are important; and in locations that are quite "marginal" for TOD, all enablers must interact together positively for the development to have the maximum likelihood of going ahead as planned.

AB  - Forest management in Central and Eastern Europe, under direct or indirect Soviet influence, for a long time followed different management objectives and strategies as compared to the forest management in countries with market economies in Western Europe located in the same biogeographic zones. In the light of the appearing paradigms of natural disturbance regimes and ecosystem-based forest management we evaluate forest management in the former Soviet Union and Sweden with respect to conservation of riparian forest ecotones. We studied the site and forest age class distribution both along watercourses and at randomly selected locations in the surrounding terrain in managed landscapes in Sweden and the former Soviet Union, respectively. Along watercourses in the former Soviet Union 20% of the overall forest cover was classified as old-growth compared with 6% in the surrounding landscape. By contrast, although the proportion of site type distribution was similar, such forests were neither found along watercourses nor in the surrounding landscape in Sweden. The results hence show that the Soviet management policy resulted in better conditions from the biodiversity conservation perspective. We conclude that the forestry decision-making environment does matter for practical forest conservation. We also make the following recommendations to forest and environmental planners and decision-makers: (1) protect existing and restore and re-create riparian corridors in general; (2) maintain riparian forests along streams of all orders, because small rivers are as important for conservation of biodiversity as large rivers; (3) designate riparian corridors for protection not focusing on a single width, but rather based on vegetation site type appropriate for stand types with a continuous forest cover.

AB  - The novel articulations between the state, markets and civil society arising from the shift to networked environmental governance highlight the importance of creating equal participation opportunities. Relevant questions from an environmental justice perspective are not only who participates, but also with whom, in what, why and how. In this paper, we explore public participation in biodiversity governance that has emerged after the initial designation of a Natura 2000 network in Finland, Greece, Poland and the UK by focusing on distributive and procedural justice. Our analysis, based on focus groups and document analysis, shows that new participatory arrangements have taken the modes of project-based, market, interest group and e-governance. These arrangements have been marked by problems in power and knowledge sharing, and in the distribution of conservation costs and benefits, reflecting serious deficits regarding environmental justice. Calls for public participation and wider stakeholder engagement in conservation across Europe should be followed by an acknowledgment of the diversity of perspectives, conflicting interests and social positions and their integration into biodiversity governance.

AB  - Long-term records of environmental history at decadal to millennial time-scales enable an assessment of ecosystem variability and responses to past anthropogenic disturbances and are fundamental for the development of environmental management strategies. This study examines the local variability of land-use history in the South Swedish Uplands over the last 200 years based on pollen records from three lake-sediment successions. Temporal changes in the proportional cover of 14 plant taxa were quantified as percentages using the landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA). The LRA-based estimates of the extent of four land-use categories (cropland, meadows/grassland, wetland, outland/woodland) were compared to corresponding estimates based on historical maps and aerial photographs from ad 1769-1823, 1837-1895, 1946 and 2005. Although the LRA approach tends to overestimate grassland cover by 10-30 % for the two earliest time periods, the reconstructed vegetation composition is generally in good agreement with estimates based on the historical records. Subsequently, the LRA approach was used to reconstruct the 200-year history of local land-use dynamics at 20-year intervals around two small lakes. The qualitative assessment of difference approach, which requires fewer assumptions and parameters than LRA for objective evaluation of between-site differences in plant abundances, provides consistent results in general. Significant differences exist in the land-use history between the sites. Local catchment characteristics, such as soil conditions and wetland cover, appear important for the development of human impact on the landscape. Quantifications of past vegetation dynamics provide information on the amplitude, frequency and duration of the land-use changes and their effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and should be taken into account when nature conservation strategies are developed.

AB  - Over the last two decades intergovernmental organizations have supported the initiation of National Forest Programs (NFPs): forums for joint deliberation by the state, private companies and NGOs that are intended to resolve conflicts over forestry and enhance sustainability. However, NFPs do not always reconcile conflicting perspectives or produce legitimate strategies for sustainable forestry. Thus, further analysis of NFPs organization and processes is required, including exploration of effective means to address such challenges in early stages. These are key concerns of this paper, focusing on the first process to establish a Swedish NFP. Possibilities for an NFP to constitute a new arena for deliberation and consensus-building, producing forest policy statements and action plans considered legitimate by various stakeholders, are discussed. A number of key challenges are identified through a theoretical framework based on notions regarding the input and output legitimacy of collaborative governance. Analysis of official documentation, records of public hearings and stakeholder comments from the establishment phase in 2013-2015 suggests that the process will continually face a number of challenges, including balancing production and conservation values in the new bio-economy and securing equal stakeholder participation. The paper concludes with some remarks on the future of the NFP process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Norway has more than 100,000 km of coastline and associated shore zone. The shore zone is an attractive area for development and infrastructure on the one hand, and recreation and protection of biological diversity on the other. The Norwegian Planning and Building Act contains a general ban on any building in the area between the ordinary high water mark and up to 100 m inland from the shoreline. Exemptions can be granted, however, by the competent municipality through land planning and individual decisions. The importance attached to leaving the shore zone untouched varies from region to region. There are large geographical differences in terms of biodiversity, cultural heritage, landscape, development, development pressure, migration and depopulation, and commercial activity, as well as public access to the coastal areas and the ocean. Since 2011, the entire Norwegian shore zone became subject to guidelines that regulate a geographical differentiation of management and a more severe protection of central areas. This article analyses key aspects of the Norwegian shore zone regulation.

AB  - Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity.
   Methods: This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website.
   Results: Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively.
   Conclusions: This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.

CP  - Symposium on Northern Dimension to Biodiversity - From Arctic to Boreal Environments
AB  - Biodiversity conservation in Finland has developed from old hunting and forest-use regulations towards habitat conservation based on ecological research and international agreements on protection of wildlife. Hunting of game animals and persecution of species considered as pests have been legally regulated in Finland since the Middle Ages. The first attempts to control forest destruction date back to the 1600s. Banning of spring hunting of waterfowl was suggested already in 1769. The rise of "modern" nature conservation in the late 1800s was apparently influenced by the European bird conservation movement (introduced to Finland in 1870 by Z. Topelius), the widespread criticism towards the 1898 Hunting Decree, and the growing interest towards conservation issues among biology and forestry professionals, inspired by an article published by A. E. Nordenskiold. Already in the 1800s both hunting/persecution and habitat changes were perceived as threats to wildlife. The Nature Conservation Act, which became the cornerstone for Finnish conservation policy, was enacted in 1923. In the 20th century the numbers of protected species and conservation areas have increased. For more than a century Finnish conservationists have participated in international conservation efforts, in which Finland now participates as a member of the European Community.

AB  - This article appraises the career of architect Ralph Erskine focusing on the context for his contribution to Swedish and British social housing and planning. Erskine's formative experience during the 1930s and his subsequent transnational career are utilized to explore the mutual influences of planning ideals across national boundaries. The Garden City ideal, Functionalism and the urban village concept are considered for their long-term contribution to his work. In addition, vernacular architecture and participatory planning are explored as influences on the evolution of his community architecture vision by the 1970s. Drawing on evidence from urban developments in Britain and Sweden, the discussion demonstrates that Erskine's cultural transfer of international planning ideals essentialized aspects of British and Swedish historical culture. The article concludes with a discussion of the 1970s and Erskine's role in the redevelopment of Byker in Newcastle upon Tyne. This process was hailed as a pioneer moment in the English community architecture movement. However, this study demonstrates that Erskine should be distinguished from the grassroots activism of the community architecture movement. Rather the discussion emphasizes that his participatory planning was underpinned by a structural tension between social engineering and democratic participation that was generated and reinforced by his transnational career.

AB  - In Swedish boreal landscapes, the loss of species-rich semi-natural grasslands is largely due to a long history of agricultural abandonment. Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe.
   The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The results of this study have implications for forest management practices. Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of habitats for butterflies and other organisms.

AB  - Aquaculture is a major contributor to global food production, but has attracted considerable controversy. Disagreements over the social and ecological impacts of aquaculture (positive and negative) have hindered further expansion of aquaculture production, particularly in wealthy democratic countries. This article presents findings from a series of workshops bringing international aquaculture scholars together from the natural and social sciences to examine and compare socialecological challenges facing aquaculture development in five nations: Canada, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. This multinational comparison provides unique insights into common and particular challenges in aquaculture governance - a dimension that is missing in current literature about the industry. A political ecology framework from the environmental social sciences is used to examine how natural and human phenomena interact to shape these challenges and frame the conflicts that often result. The analysis reveals a wide range of social-ecological factors limiting aquaculture expansion in the five countries, including access to suitable environments, interactions with other sectors, and policy and regulatory gaps - not only with respect to aquaculture, but also on related issues such as marine spatial planning and the involvement of indigenous peoples in decision-making. The findings provide preliminary guidance for future policy development and comparative aquaculture research.

AB  - Declines in European farmland birds over past decades have been attributed to the combined effects of agricultural intensification and abandonment. Consequently, aspirations to stop declines should focus attention on reversing these changes through voluntary or policy-driven interventions. The design of such interventions should ideally be informed by scientific knowledge of which aspects of the transformation of agricultural landscapes have contributed to the farmland bird declines. Declines may be associated with loss of natural habitats or the intensification and homogenization of land use management on production land, and furthermore, these changes may interact. Here, we applied an orthogonal design exploiting spatial variation in land use in a major agricultural region of Sweden to seek evidence for benefits to farmland birds of reversing some of the intensifications on and among arable fields and whether effects are modified by the availability of seminatural habitats (pastures and field borders) in the landscape. We accounted for the potentially confounding effect of interactions between species by using a joint species distribution model explicitly controlling for additional variation and covariation among species. We found that interventions aimed specifically at land in production could provide benefits to farmland birds. Landscapes with a higher proportion leys or fallows and/or with a more diverse set of crops held higher abundances of most farmland birds. However, effects were only apparent in landscapes with low availability of seminatural habitats and were sometimes even negative in landscapes with high amounts of such habitats, demonstrating context dependence. Even if we found little evidence of interactions between species, the joint modeling approach provided several benefits. It allowed information to be shared between species making analyses robust to uncertainty due to low abundances and provided direct information about the mean and variability in effects of studied predictors among species. We also found that care needs to be taken regarding prior and distributional assumptions as the importance of species interactions might otherwise be overstated. We conclude that this approach is well suited for evaluating agricultural policies by providing evidence for or against certain interventions or to be linked to policy scenarios of land use change.

AB  - This study aimed to identify tools for taking capercaillie habitats into consideration in forest management. This would provide new alternatives for ecologically more sustainable forest management. Capercaillie summer and winter locations, from wildlife monitoring counts (1998-2004) in northern Finland, and reference, non-capercaillie locations were combined with forest planning data, and the area proportions of different landscape classes in an 800-m radius circle surrounding capercaillie and reference locations were compared. Thinning stands (in summer and winter) and spruce mires (in summer) were more abundant in capercaillie habitats than in reference landscapes, whereas e.g. seedling stands, mature stands and waste land areas were less abundant. The relative habitat use was highest in mean tree diameter (DBH) classes from 10.5 to 14.5 cm in summer habitats of adult capercaillie in heath forests, whereas in peatland forests, in brood habitats and in winter habitats it peaked in diameter classes 14.5 to 18.5 cm. The tree layer density was positively associated with the relative habitat use. A trend of lower habitat use was detected in the largest diameters (17-40 cm) in comparison to middle-sized diameters (10-16 cm) in heath forests, but not in peatland forests. Relatively young managed forests (age 30-40 years or more) can form suitable capercaillie habitats in north-boreal forests. However, this suitability is not necessarily permanent. Understorey management, longer rotations and multicohort forest management are suitable tools for capercaillie habitat management, because they can increase the available cover close to the ground, canopy cover, overall forest cover at the landscape scale and bilberry cover.

AB  - The most appropriate strategy for preserving fragmented populations depends on a species' ability to colonise distant habitat patches. Insects associated with early decay stages of dead wood are expected to have a high capacity to colonise new habitat patches. To study the dispersal ranges of beetles (Coleoptera) and flat bugs (Hemiptera: Aradidae) dependent on recently dead aspen (Populus tremula) wood in Finland, we set out 58 piles of recently cut aspen logs at various distances up to 1.6 km from forests that contained a high density of old aspen trees. We captured insects by trunk window-traps, and counted beetles' exit holes. Habitat connectivity was measured in terms of the amount of suitable aspen-wood in the surrounding environment, with the closest dead wood items up-weighted by a negative-exponential function. The log-piles attracted many saproxylic insects including four red-listed aspen-specialist species. The exposure of log-piles to the sun, and high levels of habitat connectivity increased the species richness of aspen-specialists, whereas bark peeling by moose decreased richness. The spatial scale at which species richness had its strongest response to habitat was 93 m. Among individual species there was a wide variability in spatial scale of response. This study supports the view that conservation efforts in boreal forests should be concentrated on sites where colonisation by target species is most likely. Restoration of habitat by re-locating logs may be useful at localities with a rich and specialised fauna but which have too low rate of formation of dead wood by natural processes.

AB  - Title of the paper: The history of vegetation dynamics and forest use in the Leopolds-Hochwald, a forest area in the upper range of the Western Bavarian Forest (Vorderer Bayerischer Wald) - a contribution to the importance of forest-historical, archival documents.
   The reconstruction of forest history is possible by means of various methodological approaches. Early forest-historical research mainly used archival documents, that means in particular descriptive sources, to reconstruct former tree species composition as well as forest uses and conditions of forests. In the following decades other methods were established for historical forest and landscape research, e.g. pollen analysis, charcoal analysis and dendrochronology. Up to now those questions are viewed multidisciplinary in many cases. Conclusions are revealed which are not comparable to the results of those acquired by means of one single method. Archival documents are able to contribute important information to this.
   There are a lot of descriptive sources mainly about forest use and tree species composition available about the Leopolds-Hochwald (fig. 1 and 2), a forest area located in the upper range of the Western Bavarian Forest, and the adjacent forest areas in the south (Vorberge). In the 17(th) century forests close to settlements (Vorberge) were considerably over-used already, due to being simple to reach. The removal of timber and firewood has led to a lack of wood, wood pasture and litter utilisation to a degradation of soil and promotion of coniferous trees. Due to its location far away from settlements Leopolds-Hochwald was influenced just a little until the beginning of the 17(th) century, so the composition of tree species was assessed by recent vegetation studies almost natural (beech-fir-mixed forests with little proportion of spruce and maple). As a consequence of decreased resources in the forests close to settlements (Vorberge) forest use also increased in Leopolds-Hochwald, despite of prohibitions and limitations. Nevertheless, at the turn of the 19(th) century Leopolds-Hochwald was still beech-dominated, thus the intensity of forest use was comparatively low in this area. By including historical settlement and economy data, also those of the Eastern Bavarian Forest, it becomes apparent, that forest uses were almost exclusively characterized by rural management and not by industrial, large-scale utilisations like glass or iron industry.
   Despite of its pure descriptive character, archival forest documents allow very detailed temporal and spatial and therefore partially also ecological mapping of historical forest conditions. The results are not only important in forestry planning, they are also an crucial tool in nature conservation. Archival documents contribute to better understanding of current landscape patterns, distribution of forest and open areas as well as vegetation patterns. Moreover, they can give evidence for localisation and management of valuable areas.

AB  - Several international agreements make the preservation of forest biodiversity one of the aims in the utilization of forest resources. This means that the state of forests must be continuously monitored at the national level and attention given to biodiversity in forest management.
   In Finland, the biodiversity debate has recently been extended to parts of Russian Karelia, where wood raw material is being procured for Finnish mills. A study carried out at the European Forest institute has examined the situation in these areas before the introduction of Finnish forestry methods and compared the effects of these methods on the forest environment and its dynamics. The areas included were the southern part of the North Karelia forestry board area in Finland and the wood procurement area used by Ladenso Oy in the Karelian Republic in Russia. The latter area was part of Finland before 1945.

AB  - In Finland, modern forestry has caused the gross modification of native forest habitats and a loss of biological diversity due to intensive management regimes. Although less than 1% of the old-growth forest area remains in southern Finland, the effects of forestry on bird population long-term trends have not been comprehensively studied in this area. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed 30 years of monitoring data of 32 common forest breeders in southern Finland. For each species, we fitted piecewise log-linear trends in two segments: 1984-1998 (period 1) and 1999-2013 (period 2). The estimated trends were analysed in relation to the species-specific habitat preferences, average tree height preference, migratory strategy, and latitudinal distribution. The trends turned on average more negative in period 2 compared to period 1, but the between-species variation in this change was not explained by any of the predictors. For the whole study period, species with a preference for late successional and nutrient-poor habitats (mostly found in northern latitudes) showed more negative population trends. In addition, trends changed on average -3%/500 km latitude. We further developed three summarizing multi-species indices, most of which should be useful for monitoring the general state of breeding forest bird communities in southern Finland. Our results suggest that bird communities are shaped by both a loss of mature forests and by climate warming. The decline of birds preferring native forests, reflected by the mature forest index, could undoubtedly change with an improvement of the conservation effectiveness in southern Finland.

AB  - The basidiomycete Phlebia centrifuga is a wood-decay fungus characteristic for unmanaged old-growth forests of spruce, a habitat that has become increasingly fragmented due to forest management. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic population structures of P. centrifuga in both continuous and fragmented habitats, and estimate the potential impact of fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the fungus. Three hundred fifteen single Spore isolates (representing 47 spore families and 33 single isolates) from eight populations across northern Europe (Russia, Finland, and Sweden) were screened with seven microsatellite markers and arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction with the M13 minisatellite. The two molecular methods generally gave the same pattern for the genetic population structure. There were no significant differences between the observed and the expected heterozygosities, and the inbreeding coefficient (F-IS) did not indicate any inbreeding. The fixation index F-ST) revealed a general pattern with little to moderate genetic differentiation for the majority of populations, while the southernmost Swedish population Norra Kvill was the only one showing high differentiation from about half of the other populations. Swedish population Fiby with the shortest distance to the continuous habitat was moderately differentiated from most of the others and to the largest extent differed from geographically closest population of Norra Kvill. The results indicate that the fragmentation of old-growth forest in Russia and Finland is more recent than the fragmentation in Sweden, and the genetic population structures of P. centrifuga in northern Europe might be related to differences in forest landscape dynamics between the two areas.

AB  - Flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) populations have declined severely during the past few decades and the species has become a focal species in forest management and the conservation debate in Finland. We compared landscape structure around known flying squirrel home ranges with randomly chosen forest sites to determine which landscape patterns characterize the areas occupied by the species in northern Finland. We sought to identify the key characteristics of the landscape that support the remaining flying squirrel populations. We analyzed landscape structure within circular areas with 1- and 3-km radii around 63 forest sites occupied by flying squirrels, and around 96 random sites. We applied stepwise analysis of the landscape structure where landscapes were built up step-by-step by adding patch types in order of their suitability for the flying squirrel. The land-use and forest-resource data for the analysis were derived form multisource national forest inventory and imported to a geographical information system. Landscape patch types were divided into three suitability categories: breeding habitat (mixed spruce-deciduous forests); dispersal habitat (pine and young forests); and unsuitable habitat (young sapling stands, open habitats, water). Flying squirrel landscapes contained more suitable breeding habitat patches and were better connected by dispersal habitats than random landscapes. Our results suggest that for the persistence of the flying squirrel, forest managers should 1) maintain a deciduous mixture, particularly in spruce-dominated forests; 2) maintain physical connectivity between optimal breeding habitats; and 3) impost coarse-grained structures on northeastern Finnish landscapes at current levels of habitat availability.

AB  - New approaches to forest planning are needed to support the transition of European forests to sustainable management. The aim of this study is to review forest planning systems already in place throughout Europe by exploring a set of case-study countries reflecting the main silvicultural schools of Western Europe, including Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, and Slovenia.
   A literature review and case-study data were used to assess the scale factors (vertical logic) as well as the relationships between forest planning and other environmental/land-use planning sectors (horizontal logic). The influence of EU policy on the development of forest planning is also discussed. As assessed using the vertical logic, the multi-scale and multi-topic planning approaches adopted in the countries studied here are highly heterogeneous. The horizontal logic shows that despite the importance of an inter-sectoral and harmonic relational framework between forest planning and the planning efforts of other sectors such as landscape and urban planning, the various plans are barely consistent with each other across the European countries studied here. Although interest is growing in the multi-functionality of forests, their sustainable management calls for the development of better integrated planning approaches across Europe.

AB  - Many environmental patterns that may have profound effects on wildlife communities occur at the landscape scale, e.g. habitat fragmentation, human demography and distribution of various resources. In order to understand how alterations of such patterns could influence e.g. wildlife species occurrences and community composition, it is important to first study these relationships empirically and at the appropriate scale. We surveyed the wildlife community in a boreal ecosystem in central Sweden using pellet group counts, while walking 'wildlife triangles'. Our main aim was to investigate how the distribution of medium- and large-sized wild mammals and large-sized forest birds were affected by environmental variables at the landscape scale. In 2001-2003, pellet groups of mammals and forest birds were counted on 211 triangular routes with a perimeter of 4+4+4 km. The pellet groups which had accumulated after leaf fall were counted in spring. The environmental properties of each triangle, including information on latitude, altitude, infrastructure, land cover, forest type and forest stage, were determined using GIS maps. Statistical analyses involved mainly ordination (Principal Component Analysis, PCA). Significant environmental variables explaining the wildlife community composition and distribution in the boreal ecosystem were altitude, clear-felling and infrastructure. Our conclusion, however, is that most boreal mammal and forest bird species are habitat generalists and show little spatial pattern in distributions at the landscape scale. This indicates that habitat selectiveness probably occurs at a local scale in the boreal forest. Ultimately, our conclusion provides important direction for e.g. conservation measures and wildlife management.

AB  - Greatly reduced area of old-growth forests and the very low amount of dead wood in managed forests in northern Europe have caused a marked decline in the populations of saproxylic species. It is less clear at which spatial and temporal scales these adverse changes are taking place, and more information is needed to reliably predict which species are especially sensitive to loss and fragmentation of habitat. Here we compare species richness, incidence of occurrence in forest fragments, and abundance of polyporous fungal species and species groups between two regions in Finland with contrasting histories of forestry and a marked difference in the amount and spatial configuration of old-growth forests. We also analyse the consequences of increasing loss of connectivity on the presence and abundance of polypores in a study region with a documented short-term history of old-growth fragmentation. Our results show that the species number, incidence of occurrence, and abundance of especially the rare, threatened, and near-threatened species are much lower in the old-growth fragments in Hame in southern Finland in comparison with Kuhmo in eastern Finland, most probably because of the longer history of intensive forestry in Hame. Among the rare species, the species that show the greatest difference between the two regions (at the scale of 500 km) also tended to respond most strongly to the more recent forest fragmentation within the study region in Kuhmo (at the scale of 50 km). Polypores associated with spruce seem to be more strongly affected by forestry than species associated with pine, possibly reflecting the differences in the natural dynamics of spruce-dominated and pine-dominated forests.

AB  - Land-cover change (urbanisation, deforestation, and cultivation) results in increased flood frequency and severity. Mechanisms include reduced infiltration capacity, lower soil porosity, loss of vegetation, and forest clearing, meaning lower evapotranspiration. Major research challenges lie in quantification of effects in terms of flood characteristics under various conditions, ascertaining the combined effects of gradual changes over long time periods, and developing model tools suitable for land-use management. Large floods during the 1990s gave a new focus on these problems. Reference is made to the Norwegian HYDRA research programme on human impacts on floods and flood damage.
   The paper concludes that land-use change effects on floods are most pronounced at small scale and for frequent flood magnitudes. Model simulations of effects of land-use change can now be used to reduce flood risk. Modern flood management strategies have abandoned the position that dams and dikes are the only answers to mitigating flood disasters. Today, the strategic approach is more often: do not keep the water away from the people, keep people away from the water. Flood management strategies should include flood warnings, efficient communication, risk awareness, civil protection and flood preparedness routines, effective land-use policies, flood risk mapping,... as well as structural measures.

AB  - Changing climate and growing human impacts are resulting in globally rising temperatures and the widespread loss of habitats. How species will adapt to these changes is not well understood. The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) can be found across the Holarctic but is coming under more intense pressure in many places. Studies of recent populations in Finland and Denmark have shown a marked decline in body size of Northern Goshawks over the past century. Here we investigate long-term changes to Norwegian populations of Northern Goshawk by including material from the Middle Ages. We measured 240 skeletons of modern Northern Goshawks from Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, and 89 Medieval Goshawk bones. Our results show that Norwegian and Swedish female Goshawks have decreased in size over the past century, whilst males showed little decline. Medieval female Goshawks were larger than contemporary females. A decline in forest habitats and a concomitant shift towards smaller prey likely drove a shift to smaller body size in Northern Goshawks. Our study shows that significant body size changes in birds can occur over relatively short time spans in response to environmental factors, and that these effects can sometimes differ between sexes.

AB  - Understanding whether people view non-native species as belonging in a place will help guide important conservation efforts ranging from eradications of exotics to re-introduction of extirpated species. In this manuscript we describe the degree to which Swedish hunters perceive key wildlife species as belonging in Swedish nature. We surveyed 2014 Swedish hunters randomly selected from a database of all registered hunters with a 47.5% response rate. We measured hunters' perceptions of the belonging of 10 key species on the Swedish landscape, compared them with confidence intervals for proportions, and predicted them using regression models. Construct validity was assessed through pretesting and focus groups. Our results suggest Swedish hunters consider species introduced wholly by humans as less likely to belong in Sweden compared with species that evolved in situ, species with negative socio-economic impact as less likely to belong in Sweden compared with species with no impact or positive economic impacts, and species with wide distributions to be seen as more likely to belong in Sweden compared with those with narrow distributions. Perceptions of wolves, fallow deer, and European rabbits differed from these broad trends potentially due to unique cultural constructions of belonging for the species and the duration since anthropogenic introductions for the latter species. Age was generally negatively related with considering species as belonging in Swedish nature, whereas few effects were detected for other demographic variables. This study suggests multiple drivers of perceived belonging for species exist, and may include where species evolved, socio-economic impacts of species, breadth of distribution, cultural naturalization, and age of stakeholders making assessments. These findings highlight the importance of managing invasive species before they become culturally naturalized or gain broad geographic distribution.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution and predicting suitable habitats for threatened species are central themes in land use management and planning. In this study, we examined the geographic distribution of threatened mire plant species and identified their national hotspots, i.e. areas with high amounts of suitable habitats for threatened mire plant species. We also determined the main environmental correlates related to the distribution patterns of these species. The specific aims were to: (1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of threatened peatland species in a boreal aapa mire zone, Finland; and (2) to identify the richness patterns and hotspots of threatened species. Our results showed that the combination of individual species models offers a useful tool for identifying landscape-scale richness patterns for threatened plant species. The modeling performance was high across the modelled species, and the richness patterns generated by single models coincide with the expected richness pattern based on expert knowledge. The method is therefore a powerful tool for basic biodiversity applications. In cases where reliable models for species occurrences and hotspots can be produced, these models can play a significant role in land-use planning and help managers to meet different conservation challenges.

AB  - There is currently increasing pressure on urban woodland in industrialised countries. Management of such areas is shifting towards multiple-use with focus on both recreation and biodiversity conservation. We examined the concept of "openness" as part of a possible tool for planners and decision makers. Our field studies were conducted in oak-dominated urban woodlands in southern Sweden with the focus on understory density. In a field experiment we found that understory density was greatly influenced by management, but effects appeared to be site-dependent. Photographs from the field sites were shown to panels of students to analyse recreational preferences in relation to openness. The photographs showed similar woodland types but with different understory density, although the quantification of this variation was not revealed to the participants. In general, open forests were considered most attractive for recreation but 74% of the respondents claimed that they preferred a mix of open and closed forest. Frequent forest visitors preferred relatively closed forests but infrequent visitors liked more open forests. As an example of management effects on biodiversity, we examined the density and diversity of woodland birds in relation to the management. We found that bird densities decreased in the plots with extensive removal of understory. We suggest that variables related to openness can be used in the planning process, especially at fine-grained scales, to analyse different management options and make trade-offs between interests in multiple-use woodland sites.

AB  - Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in population biology and conservation. Most studies have dealt with species whose population turnover rate is much higher than the rate of patch turnover. Models of the dynamics in such systems have assumed a static patch landscape. The dynamics of many species, however, are likely to be significantly affected by the dynamics of their patches. We tested the relative importance of local conditions, connectivity, and dynamics of host tree patches on the metapopulation dynamics of a red-listed epiphytic moss, Neckera pennata, in Sweden. Repeated surveys of the species and its host trees were conducted at three sites over a period of six years. There was a positive effect of connectivity, and colonizations mainly occurred in the vicinity of occupied trees. Colonizations were also less likely on strongly leaning trees. Local extinctions sometimes occurred from small trees with low local abundances but were most often caused by treefall. Simulations of the future (100 years) dynamics of the system showed that the metapopulation size will be overestimated unless the increased local extinction rate imposed by the dynamics of the trees is accounted for. The simulations also suggested that local extinctions from standing trees may be disregarded in dynamic models for this species. This implies that the dynamics of N. pennata can be characterized as a patch-tracking metapopulation, where local extinctions are caused by patch destruction.

TI  - Widespread Unquantified Conversion of Old Boreal Forests to Plantations
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
LA  - English
KW  - SWEDEN
AB  - Across the boreal biome, clear-cutting of old, previously non clear-cut forests with high naturalness followed by tree planting or seeding is a major land use change. However, how much previously uncut forest has been converted to plantations remains unquantified. We combine Swedish national databases on clear-cuts and forest inventories to show that at least 19% of all clear-cuts since 2003 have occurred in old forests that were most likely not previously cut and planted or seeded. Old forests have been cut and lost at a steady rate of similar to 1.4% per year for the same period, and at this rate they will disappear by the 2070s. There is further evidence that this type of unreported forest conversion is occurring across much of the world's boreal forest.
   Plain Language Summary Natural ecosystems that have seen limited direct human impact are threatened by land use change. Land use in boreal regions is dominated by forestry but the rate at which older boreal forests with high naturalness are converted to planted and seeded forest for wood harvesting remains unquantified. We used a set of uniquely detailed databases and maps to estimate the share of old and previously uncut forests in annual harvests and at which rate these forests are being lost in Sweden. The results indicate that about a fifth of cut forest area since 2003 was cuts of previously uncut old forest. If the present trajectory continues, the remaining unprotected old and previously uncut forests will be converted to planted and seeded managed forests within a couple of decades. Given the slow development and distinct structural and ecological characteristics of these old forests, this loss may define the landscape for centuries.

AB  - Old forest stands comprise a very small proportion of the managed forested landscapes of Scandinavia today compared with the preindustrial era. Therefore, it is important to develop conservation measures for old forest remnants and temporarily available old stands in managed forests in the most optimal way. This study examines the spatial functionality of old spruce-dominated forest in several regions of Sweden through the perspective of organisms with different ecologies, in terms of their area requirements and mobility. Instead of real species, virtual species were used representing a gradient of these two ecological traits. The main tool was habitat suitability modelling. Countrywide estimates of forest variables derived from the satellite data and field data from the National Forest Inventory using the k-nearest neighbour method were used as sources of habitat distribution data. There was large regional variation in old spruce forest functionality depending on natural conditions and forest history. The relationship between functionality and amount was largely curvilinear. Areas with > 10% of old spruce forest generally had high levels of spatial functionality, whereas high variation in functionality was observed in areas with little old spruce forest cover. This method for multiple-scale assessment of old forest functionality, using virtual species, may be helpful in regional forest biodiversity planning.

AB  - We monitored northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius, 1839) acoustically along a 27 km road transect at weekly intervals in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and again in 2016 and 2017. The methodology of data collection and the transect were the same throughout, except that the insect-attracting mercury-vapour street-lights along parts of the road were replaced by sodium lights between the two survey periods. Counts along sections of the transect with and without street-lights were analysed separately. The frequency of bat encounters in unlit sections showed an average decline of 3.0% per year, corresponding to a reduction of 59% between 1988 and 2017. Sections with street-lights showed an 85% decline over the same period (6.3% per year). The decline represents a real reduction in the abundance of bats rather than an artefact of changed distribution of bats away from roads. Our study conforms with another long-term survey of the same species on the Baltic island of Gotland. Our results agree with predictions based on climate change models. They also indicate that the decline was caused directly by the disuse of the insect-attracting mercury-vapour street-lights, which may have resulted in lower availability of preferred prey (moths). In the 1980s, E. nilssonii was considered the most common bat in Sweden, but the subsequent decline would rather qualify it for vulnerable or endangered status in the national Red List of Threatened Species.

AB  - Finns' preferences about forests and forestry in Finland were clarified via a questionnaire mailed to a sample of citizens. Maintaining the health of forests was regarded the most important objective of forest management. Also forest landowners found that aspect most valuable in the management of their own forests. Wood production and employment got surprisingly low priority compared with other modes of use and values of forests. The results demonstrate the multiple-use nature of the utilization of forests in Finland. Although biodiversity was regarded as quite important, a majority was not ready to pay more taxes for maintaining it. Slightly more than half of the respondents accepted clear-felling of forest. Most would, however, like to see a maximum size set for clear-felling areas. Nearly one out of two of the respondents were of the opinion that the area of forest land under conservation should be increased. Some differences between opinions of different strata were observed. Generally, in the light of public opinion, recent years' changes in forest management directives to more environmental friendly practices in Finland appear to be correct.

AB  - There is currently a growing concern that biocultural heritage is threatened in many landscapes. This paper focuses on biological cultural heritage, broadly meaning biological cultural traces that are considered as heritage, but leaving out other aspects of the biocultural heritage concept. An operational definition of biological cultural heritage (BCH) is suggested, based on niche construction theory: "biological manifestations of culture, reflecting indirect or intentional effects, or domesticated landscapes, resulting from historical human niche construction". Some factors that influence recognition of BCH are discussed, using a comparison between Swedish open to semi-open vs. forested landscapes. While the former landscapes are generally associated with biological cultural values, BCH is generally over-looked in forests. Two main reasons for this are suggested: loss of cultural memory and a perception of forests as wilderness. A conclusion is that recognition of BCH is essential for guiding development of biological conservation programmes in forests, irrespective of whether the conservation goal is to focus on culturally impacted forests or to conserve what is considered as close to pristine forests. Furthermore, recognising BCH in forests will promote interest and learning of the history of forests and their values and will be informative for developing conservation programmes for all biota in forests, not only those that historically were favoured by culture. Hence, there is no inherent conflict between preserving relatively untouched forests and those with remaining traces of pre-industrial forest management. The recognition of BCH in forests will inspire and promote further integration of cultural and natural heritage research.

AB  - Global change is affecting agroforestry and its inherent ecosystems in Sweden. Here we examine the benefits of ecologically adjusted dam regulations to conserve biodiversity under climate change in floodplain habitats, including meadows and riparian mixed forests. The natural flood regime in snow-dominated regions has changed significantly during the last decades, in line with the projections for climate change. The ecosystems of temporary flooded forests show high biodiversity but are dependent on river high flows with long duration. These events are rare in the new climate scenario, but on the other hand, snow-fed rivers are also affected by hydropower dams and regulations. In this study we explored the potential of using reservoir regulation to artificially induce flood events; water management would then be a method to conserve biodiversity in forest habitats and adapt management to climate change. We made detailed calculations in lower Dalalven River, central Sweden, using observed time-series of river flow and dynamic scenario modeling for highly valuable Natura 2000 habitats. Here we show that long-term flooding is less frequent since extensive hydropower was introduced during the 1920s, and moreover, since the 1990's the spring floods are low due to low snow storage and short winter seasons. Sustainable management of 50% of the riparian forest requires flooding by 25 continuous days of 800 m(3) s(-1). We found that artificial floods using new ecological regulation regime of upstream hydropower reservoirs would help, but not be enough, to achieve this goal. The new regulation routines would correspond to a loss of 50-200 GWh in hydropower production for each artificial flood. Sustainable ecosystems in the study site do not request flooding every year, but some every fifth year. For practical implementation, the County Board is currently driving the process locally and we discuss the relevant social features, such as legal and funding aspects, of this adaptive management of water and forests. A smaller part of the forest could probably be rescued and costs could potentially be lowered by using only the most snow rich years and seasonal forecasting of river flow for optimal timing of water release from dams to induce flooding.

AB  - In 2008, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity introduced the scientific-technical concept of describing Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs). These areas are defined as locations with exceptional ecological or biological characteristics. While EBSAs have been identified across the world ' s oceans, they mainly have not been designated at scales relevant for conservation or area-based planning, where decisions are implemented. Here, we describe how the EBSA concept can be applied locally to identify "national EBSAs". We present the process and criteria that were used in Finland to delineate 87 Ecologically Significant Underwater Marine Areas (EMMAs). This was accomplished by participatory approaches, expert knowledge, and spatial prioritization, based on a spatially explicit dataset on marine species and habitats from 160,000 sites, together with environmental drivers and anthropogenic pressures. The spatial scale of EMMAs was tailored to fit national and local decision-making, contributing to maritime spatial planning, environmental permitting, and the development of marine protected area network. We describe the Finnish EMMA process, highlight critical phases of the work using practical examples and discuss the importance of scales in assessing ecologically and biologically significant areas in different types of marine environments.

AB  - An increasing number of land use conflicts involving planning practice, equine activities and businesses and neighbouring landowners and residents have occurred in Swedish peri-urban areas. In a case study the disturbances and benefits arising from horses experienced by residents in two different areas of Sweden were investigated, together with a study of the attitudes of local planners to horse keeping near residential areas and subsequent policy documents. The results from the study found few conflicts between residents and horse keeping but revealed diverging practice and policy between municipalities, which may create a legal insecurity for the involved stakeholders. The results were mirrored in the broader perspective of spatial planning facing new challenges in the wake of the urban-rural diffusion. This was obtained by means of current planning theory discourse in examining the effects of set-back distance from rural contexts when applied in urban areas. The study illustrated a planning problem where the planning tools for managing this issue has been built on the urban-rural dichotomy providing unclear planning practice and policy in a peri-urban context. The result may be used to elucidate the character of this issue in the search for suitable planning tools in peri urban areas.

AB  - PurposeThe concept of green urban mobility has emerged as one of the best approaches for promoting environmental-friendly transportation in local communities. Green urban mobility aims to reshape public transportation system and enhance mobility, with emphasis on deploying digital technologies to promote sustainable public transportation. Therefore, this study aims to analyze existing public transportation policies by exploring how local communities can facilitate green urban mobility by developing a sociotechnical urban-based mobility model highlighting key factors that impact regions transitioning toward sustainable transportation.Design/methodology/approachThis study investigates "the role of data for green urban mobility policies toward sustainable public transportation in local communities" in the form of a systematic literature review and insights from Norway. Secondary data from the literature and qualitative analysis of the national transport plan document was descriptively analyzed to provide inference.FindingsFindings from this study provides specific measures and recommendations as actions for achieving a national green mobility practice. More important, findings from this study offers evidence from the Norwegian context to support decision-makers and stakeholders on how sustainable public transportation can be achieved in local communities. In addition, findings present data-driven initiatives being put in place to promote green urban mobility to decrease the footprint from public transportation in local municipalities.Practical implicationsThis study provides green mobility policies as mechanisms to be used to achieve a sustainable public transportation in local communities. Practically, this study advocates for the use of data to support green urban mobility for transport providers, businesses and municipalities administration by analyzing and forecasting mobility demand and supply in terms of route, cost, time, network connection and mode choice.Social implicationsThis study provides factors that would promote public and nonmotorized transportation and also aid toward achieving a national green urban mobility strategy. Socially, findings from this study provides evidence on specific green urban mobility measures to be adopted by stakeholders in local communities.Originality/valueThis study presents a sociotechnical urban-based mobility model that is positioned between the intersection of "human behavior" and "infrastructural design" grounded on the factors that influence green urban mobility policies for local communities transiting to a sustainable public transportation. Also, this study explores key factors that may influence green urban mobility policies for local communities toward achieving a more sustainable public transportation leading to a more inclusive, equitable and accessible urban environment.

AB  - In Northern Europe, human activities have caused a substantial decrease in the number of old deciduous trees over the last two centuries, leading to a decline in species populations associated with this habitat. One way to mitigate this trend is to increase the abundance of mature and old deciduous trees in commercial forests, such as by tree retention at final harvest. We analysed the biodiversity value of retained mature oaks in the production forests of Norway spruce in southern Sweden, using oaks in pastures as reference. The forest oaks were grown in two different levels of shade. We analysed two categories of saproxylic (i.e. dead wood-dependent) beetles: those utilizing oaks (Group I) and those utilizing oak but not spruce (Group II, which was, therefore, a subcategory of Group I). We found that forest oaks sustained high beetle diversity, in particular, Group I beetles, which were significantly more abundant in forest oaks in heavily thinned patches, as compared with pasture oaks and oaks in moderately thinned patches. For both beetle groups, the composition differed between the forest oaks and pasture oaks, indicating that the forest oaks can be a complementary habitat to that of pasture oaks. There was a positive relationship between oak dead branch diameter and beetle biodiversity, but only for older oaks (similar to 200 years old). We conclude that retaining oaks in production spruce forests can increase the diversity of oak associated beetles at the landscape scale. Since many oak associated species depend on relatively high levels of insolation, management of retained oaks in production forests should include periodic removal of encroaching trees.

AB  - The paper analyses stakeholder involvement and public participation in preparing Regional Forest Programmes (RFP) in Finland. Such programmes establish the outlines for regional forest management, setting targets and action plans for industrial timber use, non-wood production, recreational activities, and nature conservation in each region. Our analysis suggests that the RIP process has brought together a significant cross-section of actors who meet on a regular basis. Hence, it has become an institutionalised cooperation between key stakeholder organisations. It has facilitated information exchange and learning about issues pertaining to forest management practices, timber markets, and protection of biodiversity. Engaging the general public in the RIP process has, however, been mostly ineffectual. The process has also fallen short of the expectations to reconcile different perspectives and produce jointly accepted strategies. The biggest challenges lie in finding approaches to address conflicts constructively and to draw up a RIP that will contribute to actual changes in forest management activities.

AB  - The mining industries of Sweden and Finland currently face several policy issues around investment, stakeholder involvement, and sustainability. Since the two countries garnered significant attention during the mining boom, research from a social sciences perspective grew significantly. One approach to understanding how these issues in Sweden and Finland compare to international examples is through an analysis of the policy development framework. Looking at three factors-institutions, actors, and process-gives a broad overview of the imminent challenges in both Sweden and Finland and potential lessons from existing research that point to similar problems and their solutions. As the mining operations continue to sit at the center of different values, capable policy is required.

AB  - Norwegian Protected Landscapes aim to preserve landscape character. As most of the agricultural land in Protected Landscapes is privately owned, the attitudes and behaviour of farmers are crucial in achieving this goal. We present results of a nationwide questionnaire to farmers who owned or managed farmland in Protected Landscapes. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents claimed that their farm business had been changed as a consequence of landscape protection. Niche products and alternative income possibilities, commonly forwarded as potential benefits of landscape protection status, had generally not been realised. Although we found that most farmers agreed on the importance of taking care of cultural landscapes, 76% felt that this was best done by using rather than protecting the landscape. The study revealed negative attitudes towards municipal authorities. A quarter of respondents were strongly against the establishment of new Protected Landscapes, even if they were compensated for economic losses. Based on results of the study we suggest that major improvements to the protection system could be made by improving communication between management authorities and farmers, and ensuring real involvement of farmers in making and carrying out management plans.

AB  - Soft regulatory measures are argued to represent a useful alternative to hard regulation when policy-makers seek to deal with difficult problems. This article investigates the impact of a national guideline on climate and energy planning adopted in Norway, a soft regulatory instrument, which sought to encourage stronger local climate mitigation policies. To assess the effectiveness of this policy approach the research reported here investigated the impact of the guideline on the institutionalization of local climate policy activity in a set of Norwegian municipalities. Our findings indicate that for municipalities in the early phases of developing their climate mitigation policy the planning guideline contributed to legitimizing climate policy by linking it to other policy areas. For municipalities that had come further in developing their climate mitigation policy, however, the planning guideline made little difference. The findings indicate that even if soft policy instruments might be needed in a situation with complex regulatory issues, it is difficult to achieve results without the support of harder policy measures. This is particularly the case if local authorities face financial constraints and lack manpower in their work in developing effective climate mitigation policy.

AB  - In the last few decades, many cities have experienced structural change with deindustrialisation and public closure as a result. Strategies for regeneration include investments in infrastructures for production, consumption and communication. The transformation process results in deteriorated urban environments, and a change in the use and understanding of the urban landscape. The article discusses structural change and infrastructure planning, and its consequences for cultural heritage and the sense of place. We take the theoretical position that an understanding of place is crucial for sustainable heritage management, and that cultural meanings are generated through a combination of people - place interactions in time and space. Empirical findings are based on a case study of infrastructure planning and heritage management in the town of Soderhamn in northern Sweden. The analysis shows that the planning and management refers to space rather than to qualities of place. A tentative model is presented to draw attention to the importance of comprehensive analysis of investments in infrastructure and its consequences for cultural heritage.

AB  - Seagrass meadows and their associated biodiverse assemblages have declined globally due to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. Restoration of these critical habitats has the potential to reverse coastal biodiversity loss. Here, we tested the role of patch size (which can affect recruitment, food availability, and/or predation) in driving faunal colonization in an eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration trial in Sweden. Eelgrass shoots were transplanted in plots with different configurations (continuous vs. checkerboard patterns with three patch sizes), and we followed invertebrate colonization (biodiversity and functional diversity) during the first two growing seasons. We found rapid faunal colonization following the transplantation of eelgrass shoots in all plots with invertebrate densities reaching 50-80% of the reference meadow after only one growing season (3 months). After two growing seasons (15 months), the faunal density, biodiversity, and functional diversity were similar to the reference meadow, despite eelgrass density and biomass still being lower than the reference meadow. Biodiversity, functional diversity, and community structure were similar among the different planted plots, that is, there was no indication that patch size influenced faunal colonization. We therefore consider that smaller patches embedded within larger restoration plots can be as effective for promoting biodiversity as continuous patches, with reduced costs and fewer shoots required. We also noted high natural variability between years both in the reference meadow and planted plots, showing the dynamic nature of seagrass ecosystems, and the importance of a well-planned monitoring scheme that considers the reference area and restored area within the same temporal scale.

AB  - Municipalities across Finland are promoting wooden multistorey construction as a low-carbon alternative for building construction. However, do attitudes towards implementing these alternatives stem from the opportunity to reduce carbon emissions or because these alternatives are perceived to improve local economies? This research employs a survey to collects the attitudes of Finnish municipal civil servants towards implementing wooden multistorey buildings in their municipalities. The respondents represent a mix of administrative professionals such as planners, real estate managers, building inspectors and other strategic managerial professionals (n = 273, 8% response rate). Their responses reflect views from approximately 8% of all municipal civil servants working on municipal land use and planning issues during 2019. The findings reveal attitudes towards implementing wooden multistorey buildings are engendered by fulfilling ecological development, economic development, technical quality and output efficiency goals. Furthermore, comparing municipal planners to other municipal administrators reveals dissimilar planning logics. Municipal planners holistically prioritize the project's ecological and economic development outcomes. Other administrators chiefly prioritize economic development outcomes. Hence, some municipal administrators may value wooden multistorey construction primarily as an activity to improve municipal vitality rather than as a holistic spatial planning solution. Future research should identify whether these divergences lead to planning tensions within municipal administrations.

AB  - Traditionally managed meadows and pastures are increasingly abandoned or replaced with intensively cultivated arable fields in the UK and Europe. These habitats are important reservoirs of plants valued for their medicinal properties, cultural significance, and genetic diversity. Whether grassland biodiversity will persist without human management is currently unknown. Here, I combine palaeoecological data and modern vegetation surveys to determine the origin of species-rich grassland in Oxfordshire, England and long-term temporal and spatial changes in grassland biodiversity over time. I also examine whether forage crop wild relatives, a group of plant genetic resources, are dependent upon pastoral activities. In situ and ex situ conservation of crop wild relatives is increasingly important because they provide plant breeders with novel sources of genetic diversity to adapt crops to changing climate conditions. I demonstrate that species-rich grasslands only developed around 2000 years ago due to anthropogenic intervention and would revert to oscillating between open grassland and woodland without human management. Temporally and spatially, high levels of biodiversity are associated with the creation of species-rich grasslands. These areas are still hotspots of vegetation diversity today and wild relatives of forage grasses and legumes are closely linked to these areas. I argue that conservation activities should focus their attention on species-rich grasslands located in areas of longterm biodiversity, allowing other sites to revert, and that future research could focus on monitoring, characterizing, and collecting plant genetic resources from these sites.

AB  - Conservation of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, a threatened habitat, is dependent on their ability to disperse between the few and fragmented patches remaining in the landscape. To maintain metapopulations dynamics and reduce the risk of regional extinction, it is essential to know whether other, more widespread, habitats can act as alternative habitat for the biodiversity associated with threatened habitats. Here, we study how four widespread habitat types in boreal landscapes-forest, permanent grassland, abandoned grassland and road verge-can contribute to the conservation of plant species found in semi-natural grasslands which is a species-rich ecosystem important for plant and pollinator diversity that has experienced extensive reduction, fragmentation and isolation. We compare richness of all vascular plants, insect-pollinated plants and semi-natural grassland specialists among habitat types in two regions is Norway where semi-natural grasslands are few and fragmented. Based on overlap in community composition and local species richness, road verges were the most promising alternative habitat for both insect-pollinated plants and semi-natural grasslands specialists. Several habitat specialist species were, however, only found in semi-natural grasslands and, for these species, no other habitat can be considered suitable as alternative habitat. Our results highlight that a holistic management perspective is needed to maintain biodiversity associated with semi-natural grasslands. Thus, both the protection of remaining patches of the primary, threatened habitats as well as management of widespread, alternative habitats in the landscape should be prioritized.

AB  - 1. The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding success of three forest grouse species in Finland.
   2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to the Akaike information criterion.
   3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most intensive.
   4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect, but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are likely to involve drowning of chicks.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining ones.

AB  - The LIM project (Landscape Inventory and Monitoring) is a new and the first long-range survey of the Swedish rural landscape, and is a part of the nationwide environmental monitoring system. It is designed to evaluate the effects of food policy in biodiversity and cultural heritage on various scale levels and from landscape ecological perspectives. Three different central authorities are responsible, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Central Board of Antiquities and the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Data are collected in three different, integrated levels. The first level is nationwide statistics on land-use holdings collected from Farm Register and Agricultural Census. The intermediate level, the most important, is regional data from twenty reference areas, one parish, on landscape features and patterns, vegetation types and biotopes and their management, interpreted in colour infrared aerial photographs. It also includes data about farm buildings and ancient monuments. The third level contains regional data supplemented by strategically and systematically selected samples of species from field inventories. The data were collected in 1992 and 1996, and are analysed together with a historical layer in maps from about 1900. In this paper, the basic concept will be outlined and the first results of status, changes and transitions will be given. During this period, 1992-1996, Sweden shows abandonment and marginalisation in several areas, and slight intensification in a few parts. Different types of changes are distinguished, and Sweden is grouped into four different regions.

AB  - We studied survival and cause-specific mortality of radio-marked capercaillie Tetrao urogallus females relative to habitat type in northern Sweden during 2000-2004. Our high-mountain area (1,600 km(2)) consisted of the alpine transition zone from Norway spruce Picea abies-dominated forest, mountain birch Betula pubescens and alpine heath. Our low-mountain areas consisted of two forest areas (300 and 160 km(2)) dominated by Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and characterised by more intensive forestry than the first-mentioned area. Predation was the most common cause of mortality in both the high-mountain (70%) and low-mountain (90%) areas. We attributed 10% of mortality in both areas to hunting. Collisions with cars and power lines were only documented in the high-mountain area. A Cox-proportional regression model stratified by year suggested that hazard was lower for yearlings and birds using low-mountain areas, but these estimates were associated with large uncertainties. Pooling all individuals showed an average annual survival probability of 0.68 (0.62-0.75; 95% CI), with no tendency for hazard to vary among seasons. Because survival of females was comparable to those reported in other studies and the harvest mortality was low, we suggest that the capercaillie population in the Swedish high-mountain region does not need any changes in the present management strategy.

AB  - While the role of forestry in mitigating climate change is increasingly subject to political commitment, other areas, such as water protection, may be at risk. In this study, we ask whether surface waters are sufficiently safeguarded in relation to the 2015 launch of a series of measures to intensify forest management for mitigation of climate change in Norway. First, we assess how impacts on water are accounted for in existing regulations for sustainable forestry. Secondly, we provide an overview of the impacts of forestry on water quality relevant to three support schemes: afforestation on new areas, increased stocking density in existing forests, and forest fertilisation. Lastly, we assess the uncertainties that exist with regard to surface waters in the implementation of these measures. We find that the safeguards in place are adequate to protect water resources at the point of initiation, but there is a large degree of uncertainty as to the long-term effect of these mitigation measures.

AB  - Patch, matrix and human-induced disturbance variables are important in determining the structure of urban bird communities. Although green spaces in urban core areas are usually small and disturbed, they can be important for local bird diversity. Because such areas are often overlooked, their study is critical for successfully incorporating biodiversity conservation in urban planning. Furthermore, comparing bird communities from different biogeographical areas would help identify generalizable patterns and propose common management actions. We compared the structure of breeding season bird assemblages of managed small public green spaces in the urban core areas of two similar-sized European cities, Kavala (Greece) and Rovaniemi (Finland), and studied the influence of environmental variables on community structure. Species composition differed between the cities. Abundance and evenness were higher in Kavala, while richness and diversity did not differ between the cities. Abundance did not respond in a general way to the same variables in the two cities. It increased with decreasing shrub cover and distance from the city center and with increasing midday noise and ground cover in Kavala, but increased with increasing distance from the city center and decreased with increasing car traffic and midday noise in Rovaniemi. This might be explained by the lower abundance of bird dwellers in Rovaniemi. Primarily gray cover, but also other variables, at both the patch and matrix levels (e.g., noise, car traffic, distance from the city center), negatively affected richness, evenness and diversity in both cities. Green space size was positively correlated with richness and diversity in Kavala, but not in Rovaniemi, possibly due to the smaller size variation in Rovaniemi. Results emphasized that increasing gray cover is harmful for birds in small-sized green spaces in urban core areas. However, urban managers should note that not all bird community metrics responded in similar ways to same environmental variables. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, approximately 300 km2 of lakes and wetlands, representing 29% of the River Kavlingean catchment in Southern Sweden, were drained to make land available for agriculture. Published accounts of nutrient loads from the catchment indicated that until the mid 20th century, factories and urban point sources were the major contributors of both nitrogen and phosphorus. By the middle of the 20th century, the construction of sewage treatment plants had effectively reduced phosphorus pollution. Concurrently, the land drained in the previous century underwent a more intense cultivation, with productivity being maintained by commercial fertilizers. Subsequently, net nutrient loads from agriculture continued to increase, reaching an annual load of 2652 tons total-nitrogen and 70 tons total-phosphorus for the River Kavlingean. Whilst high nutrient leakage from agricultural watersheds may be a problem which is only recently recognized, it had its origins in nearly a hundred years of commonly accepted agricultural policy.
   To assess the importance of agriculture as the major source of nutrients to the River Kavlingean system, three tributary catchment areas, differing in terms of their land use patterns (high, medium and low intensity of agricultural use), were studied and compared with literature figures. Results indicated that agricultural nutrient loss areal coefficients were substantially higher than the literature figures, demonstrating the role of agriculture as source of nutrients to the River Kavlingean system. The agricultural land use policies of the last fifty years were revealed to be most important with regard to this role. Of such land use policies, the cultivation of the last 10-15% of land employed for agricultural use (primarily riparian ecotones) may be of most significance. The literature indicates that intense agricultural use of this final 10-15% may account for a ca. 50% increase in nitrogen loss. This suggests that one solution to the problem of agricultural diffuse pollution may lie in the restoration and sustainable management of riparian ecotones of agricultural streams.

AB  - Questions Rates of plant community shifts after environmental changes depend on how quickly affected species are gained and lost. Understanding how the balance between extinction and colonisation varies over time, and how it is influenced by local and landscape factors, is essential to understanding overall change trajectories. Investigating change requires data at several time steps over sufficient periods, and the paucity of such data represents an important knowledge gap. We ask: (a) how variation over time in the rates of species' extinction and species' colonization controls the trajectory of biodiversity change in abandoned semi-natural grasslands? and (b) can landscape composition and habitat history modify change trajectories by acting independently on groups within plant communities? Location Sweden, Stockholm Archipelago. Methods We use data on plant composition, management history and landscape context in former grasslands, abandoned at different points since 1901, in a space-for-time analysis, comparing rates of grassland species loss and forest species establishment and investigating resulting biodiversity trajectories. Results Grassland species declined steeply in recently abandoned habitats before levelling off, while the accumulation of forest species was linear, with no plateau reached even at the longest time since abandonment. Hence, we observed a trough in biodiversity, with an initial decline in overall species richness followed by a partial recovery. Only forest species gain was enhanced by nearby habitat availability. Conclusions Information on community compositional changes over short time periods may be misleading about the extent and even direction of ongoing biodiversity gains and losses. Moreover, the non-linear changes observed suggest thresholds in time, after which succession to the forest community accelerates and the ability to manage a return to the grassland community diminishes. Accounting for the combined influence of landscape composition and history is key to fully understanding community shifts over time.

AB  - While strengthening public-private interplay is expected to improve the climate profile of urban planning in terms of mitigation and adaptation, less is known about the practice of such new interactive modes of governing. The paper critically examines the role, benefits and limitations of extended public-private interplay in developing a new housing district in Sweden. The developer dialogue between municipal officials and property developers confirms mutual interests, shared understandings and the added value of interacting. However, the closer the dialogue comes to settling agreements, the more difficult it gets for municipal officials to steer the process and its outcomes in favor of climate proofing. Complications with adapting to the new interactive setting means that municipal officials balance between acting as facilitators and/or regulators and property developers between acting as partners, competitors and/or defenders. Refining steering-strategies for sustaining commitments and securing formal agreements are pertinent for using public-private interplay to climate-proof urban planning.

AB  - Abstract
   The main purpose of this article is to portray locals' perception of tourism impact, rural development and the role of the local communities in two World Heritage (WH) sites. The impact of WH on tourism is a much-debated matter for both WH practitioners and academics while United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) during the last 10 years has emphasised the concept of "community" as an integrated feature of the WH strategy. The results are based on an empirical attitude study in combination with focus group interviews portraying local residents' perception of WH designation and tourism in the transnational WH High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago situated in Sweden and Finland. The overall local perception of WH designation is quite similar in both countries, although ways of administrating WH sites differ. The results show an overall positive attitude towards local tourism development, but a relatively low understanding of UNESCO WH concept. High Coast residents seem to be overall more positive than the locals in Kvarken to the WH designation and a possible increase in tourism. The Finnish authorities, on the one hand, seem to have a stronger urge to benefit from the WH status than their Swedish counterparts. Nevertheless, the WH status in the rural areas of the High Coast region fits into a larger destination building and does not alone constitute the driving force for regional tourism development. Both WH sites show a limited and partly conflict-laden collaboration between communities and authorities in WH planning. Improved cooperation between actors would give WH and tourism a better chance to develop and at the same time display a more positive image of the WH sites.

AB  - Aims Present-day large-scale and plot-based vegetation analyses contribute to the transnational characterization and interpretation of biodiversity patterns and to habitat typologies, which are important for planning, monitoring and decision making in nature conservation. Many historical vegetation surveys applied cover abundance, relative occurrence or density scales (species-quantity scales) that are nowadays poorly known and consequently disregarded or misinterpreted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to put effort into making them compatible with the datasets sampled using mainstream methods. Within Europe, this especially applies to historical data from Fennoscandia. Here, we aim to propose how to transform the species-quantity scales frequently used in Fennoscandia into percentage cover scales, based on the conversion of their individual grades. Study area Fennoscandia, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Fennoscandian part of Russia (Republic of Karelia, Karelian Isthmus, Murmansk Region). Methods and results We inventoried Fennoscandian vegetation plot studies and identified that the most frequently applied species-quantity scales were those of Norrlin, Hult-Sernander and Drude. We reviewed the definitions and applications of these scales in the literature and, if not available, calculated hypothetical species covers to approximate realistic conversions to the percentage scale. As a result, we propose alternative ways of conversion of the individual scale grades to mid-percentage cover values. Conclusion Historical vegetation plot data from Fennoscandia can be used as quantitative information for vegetation research if their grades are consistently transformed into percentage cover values using the proposals presented in this paper.

AB  - Here we use long-term data from Holocene archaeological bone assemblages in order to investigate how changes in climate, vegetation and human land use might have influenced the distribution of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Norway during the Holocene. We combine four lines of evidence: an analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in a time series of subfossil teeth, distribution data of bone finds from 31 archaeological sites, changes in the relative abundance of wild ungulates from four of these sites and historical documents. A significant change in Sus diet, indicated by delta(15)N levels, was found. This coincided with the spread of agriculture and indicates a change from wild boar to domestic pigs. Based on this finding the distributional data show that the Norwegian wild boar was limited to the coastal broadleaved forests even during the most optimal climatic period. A reduction in the relative abundance of wild boar, and later extinction, seems to coincide with a reduction in such habitat, caused partly by climatic change but more pronouncedly by human habitat alterations, and competition with domestic animals. The data indicate that the primary factor limiting the northern distribution of wild boar is the availability of food resources.

AB  - IntroductionThis paper focuses on how a (assumed) entrepreneurial shift in urban planning and development has been implemented in a medium-sized city in northern Sweden, and how sustainability-as in sustainable urban development-can be argued to be a second shift in urban planning and development or represents an alternative form of neoliberal governance.MethodTo explore how and when urban entrepreneurialism and sustainability are interlinked, as well as when they are not, urban policy documents from 1988, 2007 and 2016 focusing on the development of Sundsvall city center has been examined using thematic content analysis.ResultsThe result shows that the 1988 document is significantly influenced by social democratic welfare politics, with prioritizing social bonds and the Sundsvall resident being the focus, while the newer documents emphasize visitors, potential residents and architectural design to promote the flow of people, money and goods. In this sustainability is put forward as a mobilizing metaphor, and serves to conceal the potential paradoxes of the priorities of the strategy, which involve the contradictions between economic, environmental and social values.DiscussionConsequently, it is possible to claim that sustainability, as a concept, has acquired a new function: to disguise the less palatable consequences of growth by evoking sustainability as a guarantee of the strategy's quality.

AB  - The Chilean fjord region includes many remote and poorly known areas where management plans for the marine living resources and conservation strategies are urgently needed. Few data are available about the spatial distribution of its marine invertebrate fauna, prevalently influenced by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, animal behavior and human activities. Patagonian fjords are a hotspot for finfish aquaculture, elevating Chile to the world's second producer of farmed salmon, after Norway, a condition that emphasizes the necessity to develop strategies for a sustainable aquaculture management. The present study focuses on the emblematic cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus, dwelling the Comau Fjord from shallow to deep waters, with the aim to illustrate population structure, demography and adaptation of the species and its potential use for the development of a sustainable conservation and management plan for human activities. The analyses of microsatellite loci of D. dianthus individuals from four sampling localities along horizontal and vertical gradients of Comau Fjord, lead to identify them as a panmictic population. The results also contributed to consider a careful examination of the synchrony between the temporal and spatial variations of environmental factors and the biological cycle of the species as key role player in the inference of autecology of the species. The discussion stresses the importance of molecular analyses as extremely helpful tools for studies focusing on remote areas and non-model organisms, where logistic difficulties and limited scientific knowledge hamper a better management and conservation of marine resources, and in particular the relevance of multidisciplinary approaches to reduce the extensive knowledge gap on the remote fjord ecosystems of Patagonia. This study also highlights the importance of oceanographic information in the entire process of the analyses and interpretation of genetic results.

AB  - Urbanisation has strong effects on biodiversity patterns, but impacts vary among species groups and across spatial scales. From a local biodiversity management perspective, a more general understanding of species richness across taxonomic groups is required. This study aims to investigate how fine-scale land-cover variables influence species richness patterns of locally threatened and alien species. The study was performed in Trondheim, Norway, covering a steep urbanisation gradient. Spatially correlated Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Models predicting the number of all-, threatened-and alien species by taxon, habitat, habitat heterogeneity and mean aspect within 500mx500m grid cells were constructed. The habitat categories were based on detailed land-cover maps. The highest number of threatened species was found in habitats relatively less affected by humans, whereas the number of alien species were only dependent on taxonomic group and spatial correlation. It is shown that land-cover variables within an administrative border can be used to make predictions on species richness within overarching species groups. Recommendations to biodiversity management agencies are to ensure protection of natural habitats to favour locally threatened species, and closely monitor urban areas to mitigate the introduction and spread of alien species.

AB  - Analysing forest history is crucial to understanding how shifting harvesting methods have different effects on forest landscape structure. Two main harvesting regimes in a Norwegian boreal forest landscape over a period of 150 years were detected by the study. A homogeneous impact regime resulting from selective logging changed the forest structure by logging the oldest and largest trees evenly throughout the forest, resulting in a homogeneous landscape structure. However, population growth in the 19th century led to a substantial increase in traditional subsistence forestry to obtain building materials, firewood, etc. The most intensive stage of this regime started in c.1860 when farmers began selling logging contracts to companies and timber traders. Despite this being termed a homogeneous landscape impact, the actual exploitation of the forest was strongly influenced by local factors such as the location of farms, summer farms, lakes, and rivers. Clear-cutting from the 1950s has resulted in a new heterogeneous impact regime, giving a landscape structure dominated by patches of even-aged stands. This regime still predominates. The analysis is based on a study of Nordli and the SandOla drainage basin in Nord-TrOndelag. Such studies should give a better understanding of the interaction between natural ecological conditions in and human impact on boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - Decision-makers, planners and administrators involved in different policy domains at different governance levels face the important challenge of fostering more balanced, sustainable and territorially integrated development. Well-designed, multi-level, multi-sector and multi-actor governance arrangements can play a key role in this process through orchestrating the interplay between different spheres, activities, actors and interests. In this paper, we examine the role of spatial planning in improving the relations between rural, peri-urban and urban areas. We analyse the strengths and limitations of spatial planning and explore the connections with territorial development. The methodology used for this analysis combines regional case studies in seven European locations-Ede, Frankfurt/Rhein-Main, Styria/Graz, Helsinki, Lisbon, Lucca and Mid Wales, with rapid appraisals, the analysis of published data, expert judgement and triangulation. We ask under which conditions spatial planning can induce more balanced, sustainable territorial relations, and look at the contribution planning can make to achieving sustainable development goals. The problem of ineffective (or toothless) plan implementation provides the entry point into the analysis and discussion. We illustrate why mutually beneficial relations between urban, peri-urban and rural communities (and territories) cannot simply be planned. Instead, these relationships need to be supported by strategies, policy instruments and governance arrangements that foster synergies between different actors and activities. The planning process itself needs to become more transparent and participatory. We conclude that the questions addressed in this article in an exploratory fashion merit further research especially as a more sustainable and territorially integrated development is becoming increasingly important in European policy making.

AB  - Inorganic nitrogen (N) loading was simulated by the catchment scale INCA-N model from two large river basins with contrasting land use. The main aim was to analyze the timing and origin of inorganic N loading and the effectiveness of different water protection methods. Predicted changes in precipitation and temperature increases the nutrient load from catchments to water bodies in future climate. The total inorganic N load from the forested Simojoki river basin located in northern Finland was about 5% of that from the Loimijoki river basin in south western Finland. In the Loimijoki river basin agriculture dominated inorganic N loading. When applying realistic water protection methods (limits on manure spreading) the simulated inorganic N load from the river basin decreased by 11%. With more drastic methods (no manure spreading + catch crop) a decrease up to 34% was achieved. In the Simojoki river basin there were several equally significant sources, so suitable combinations of different water protection measures would be the most efficient way to decrease the inorganic N load. As the inorganic N load may be composed of very different sources, depending on land use in the river basin, efficient allocation of water protection measures requires detailed analysis of different sources of loading.

AB  - The growth of the Finnish wolf (Canis lupus) population during the last years has highlighted people's contradictory attitudes toward wolves. The supranational conservation objectives brought on by Finland's membership in the European Union (EU) and the regional application of the official policy on wolves have led to conflicts. This article is based on the preparation process of the wolf management plan in Finland. As a part of the process, a nationwide hearing was arranged in 2004. Fear of wolves is widespread and even more common in areas with low wolf population. People living in areas where wolves occur feel that they can no longer influence decision making which affects them and that the authorities, conservationists, and the EU do not listen to their opinions. Numerous requests have been made for the legislation and its interpretation, and concessions to these requests would promote consensus and increase tolerance for wolves. Proposed changes include reforming the damage compensation system and formulating a clearer interpretation of the conservation status of wolves. However, it seems impossible to create a policy that would be universally supported. As the wolf question has become more central in environmental policy, the conservation and management of the species have become more complicated, and the cooperation between various interest groups has declined. The wolf conflict could be mitigated by compromises, but because the conflict is value-based, solutions are illusive.

AB  - Fine root (Fr) biomass, soil organic matter (SOM), and soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks are affected by land use. Conversion of woodland to agricultural land is reported to result in depletion of SOC and STN stocks. However, information on Fr biomass, and SOC and STN stocks changes following conversion of miombo woodlands to shifting cultivation lands is lacking and might be highly variable depending on the shifting cultivation system practiced. Swidden agriculture is the most complex and multifaceted form of agriculture in the world and it is a highly diverse land use system. It was expected that conversion of miombo woodlands to shifting cultivation lands would result in decreased Fr biomass, soil organic matter (SOM), and SOC and STN stocks as a result of the removal of the trees, soil burning, and other vegetation disturbances typical of this agricultural system. The results showed that the conversion of miombo woodlands to swidden agriculture lands did not impact SOM, SOC and STN stocks; however, it led to a loss of 52% of Fr biomass. In miombo woodlands, Fr biomass and the soil properties (SOM, SOC, STN) were significantly dependent on basal area (m(2) ha(-1)). In swidden agriculture lands, they were dependent on stump cross-sectional area (m(2) ha(-1)). Shifting cultivation lands have the potential to store as much organic matter, C and N in the soil as miombo woodlands, depending on the form of shifting cultivation practiced. Further researches are required on different forms of shifting cultivation practices and its impacts on soil properties.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands in Sweden are threatened by land-use change and lack of management with attendant risk to their biodiversity. We present a model to explore the effects of grazing frequency and intensity on plant species persistence, and the relative effects of grassland size and pattern. We used a landscape modelling platform, LAMOS (LAndscape MOdelling Shell), to design a landscape model of vegetation dynamics incorporating the effects of local succession, dispersal and grazing disturbance. Five plant functional groups (PFG), representing various combinations of persistence and dispersal character, light requirements and disturbance responses, were defined to model species dynamics. Based on old cadastral maps three different landscapes were designed representing specific time-layers, i.e., a historical (17th to 18th century), a pre-modern (1940s) and a present-day landscape. Simulations showed that a threshold was crossed when grasslands decreased in area to about 10 - 30% of the modelled area, and as a consequence the biomass of grassland-specific PFGs was strongly reduced. These competition sensitive groups did not persist in the model even with intense grazing in the present-day landscape, where grasslands occupy 11% of the total area. However, all grassland species would have been able to persist in the historical landscape, where grasslands occupied 59% of the total area, even without grazing. Our results suggest that continuous but low-intensity grazing is more positive for grassland PFGs than discontinuous but highly intensive grazing. This effect was particularly strong when the frequency and/or intensity of grazing dropped below a threshold of 20%. Simulations using three landscape maps designed to explore effects of further fragmentation and habitat loss showed that the spatial pattern of remaining grasslands is important for the persistence of grassland-specific PFG. The model presented here is an advance towards more realistic grazing models to explore the effects of prescribed grazing and landscape fragmentation on the persistence species or plant functional groups.

AB  - In a period of agricultural decline in the uplands of Europe, agriculture is ceasing to provide the primary rationale for the organisation, utilisation and functioning of rural space. Policy reform, market trends and changes to the way citizens and consumers think about the countryside all suggest a need for thinking strategically about the future development of these areas. However, without a broad involvement of stakeholders, land use conflicts, and social and cultural conflicts in general, may increase. Involving stakeholders in upland areas can be facilitated by using scenario technique and by discussing alternative futures in local stakeholder panels. In this paper we present four scenarios of land-use change for the year 2030, and their assessments by stakeholder panels in Scotland, France, Norway, Switzerland, Slovakia and Greece. The aim of the paper is to explore the ways in which stakeholders in these locations advocate and assess these scenarios. We also explore how stakeholders in different countries weight the visual landscape impacts, the livelihood and biodiversity aspects of the scenarios in their assessment, and the reasons for their prioritising. The cross-country analysis shows that stakeholders across the study areas are united in their overall rejection of agricultural liberalisation, advocating a production-oriented, but multifunctional and environmentally-friendly agriculture that maintains landscapes and biodiversity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to reveal possible reasons for unfavorable decisions in transit planning that weaken the possibility of increasing transit competitiveness versus the private car. The paper is based upon a qualitative case study of two Norwegian cities that have initiated projects to increase transit competitiveness versus the private car. Interviews and document studies have been conducted and interpreted using existing theories and case studies to determine possible reasons for decisions that are unfavorable for transit competitiveness. In this paper, it is concluded that conflicting politics is the main reason for unfavorable decisions in transit planning. Though the planning practitioners in the transit projects make effort to communicate to the politicians how the conflicting politics are limiting the possibility to increase transit competitiveness versus the private car, this effort has little effect. It is suggested in this work that the role of the urban planner should be extended to not only inform but also awaken a need for more knowledge among politicians and decisionmakers to help prevent unfavorable decisions being made within transit, and urban planning.

AB  - Long-term monitoring data from catchments with relatively uniform land use is important in order to cover management needs such as implementation of various EU Directives. This paper in a uniform fashion examines the temporal trends in nitrogen (N) concentrations and losses from agricultural catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Thirty-five (35) catchments (range 0.1-33 km(2)) in Norway (9), Denmark (5), Sweden (8), Finland (4), Estonia (3), Latvia (3) and Lithuania (3) were selected for this study. The longest time series were 23 years (1988-2010), while the shortest one was 10 years (2002-2011). The monthly nitrogen concentration and loss data series were tested for statistical trends (p < 0.05; two-sided test) using the partial Mann-Kendall (PMK) test with stream discharge as an explanatory variable.
   The study results show a large variation in nitrogen concentrations and losses among the studied catchments, with a large interannual variability in all catchments. For nitrogen losses, 11 statistically significant trends were detected. Nine of these were downward (four out of five Danish catchments; four out of eight in Sweden; one out of three in Finland). Upward trends were detected in two catchments (one in Estonia and one in Latvia). For nitrogen concentrations, 13 statistically significant trends were detected. 10 of these were downward. Among the 11 catchments that showed trends in nitrogen losses, nine catchments also showed statistically significant trends in the in-stream concentration series. In addition, three more Swedish catchments showed downward trends in the concentration series, and one Estonian catchment showed an upward trend. These results indicate that targeted strategies towards reduced nitrogen losses from agricultural land (as in the case of Denmark and Sweden) may significantly improve nutrient surface water quality in small agricultural catchments (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Norway is the world's leader in the production and export of farmed Atlantic salmon, and authorities there recently established a new management regime for the industry with a view to promoting substantial long-term growth in the industry. The decision by the government suggests broad acceptance for the industry in Norway, but there have been some danger signs with respect to the industry's social acceptance. This paper examines the comments submitted by a wide variety of key stakeholders on the 2014 management proposal to extract the major concerns of Norwegian stakeholders, map how wide-spread these are and evaluate whether they suggest a problem for the social acceptance of the industry at the general and local levels. Findings are analyzed using Wiistenhagen et al.'s three-fold classification of social acceptance: socio-political, community and market acceptance. In addition, findings are compared to six factors commonly suggested to affect community acceptance for innovations such as aquaculture sites. Results suggest that there are widespread environmental and socio-economic concerns with respect to the salmon aquaculture industry. Stakeholder concerns regarding issues of distributional justice may be addressed while stakeholders with strong concerns about the environmental impact of the industry are unlikely to be appeased, especially if environmental concerns are related to issues of identity or aesthetics. Submissions from Northern Norway, likely to be a major area for industry expansion indicate, a strong division on the social acceptability of the industry.

AB  - Increasingly, Protected Areas (PAs) are sustained by a multilevel governance where demands for public participation have occurred against the backdrop of state reconfiguration. Little scholarly attention has been paid to how these shifts have taken place; this paper aims to diachronically assess the involvement of non-state actors in the governance of PAs in Portugal. Our findings indicate that while the range of actors involved in the decision-making process has progressively widened, their engagement remains mainly consultative. Moreover, PAs managed by local authorities and private actors have been recognised, yet local authorities' involvement in PAs managed by state actors has been recently reduced. These apparently contradictory trends seem to illustrate a common rationale: state actors are fighting to retain control while adapting to the broadening role of multiple actors in nature conservation policies. We conclude that new governance approaches do not necessarily pave the way for more public participation in conservation.

AB  - Studies on the effectiveness of forest buffer strips left along streams after logging have long overlooked the biota of the buffers themselves, despite their high species richness. We investigated mosses and liverworts (bryophytes), abundant and species-rich groups in boreal forests, before and 2.5 years after logging along 15 small streams. In each Site, two 1000-m(2) (20 X 50 m) plots along the stream were inventoried; one plot in an area subjected to clear-cutting, and another in a buffer strip (10 m wide on each side of the stream). Ten plots along small streams in forest reserves in the same region were used as references. We found that less than half as many bryophyte species per plot disappeared after logging in the buffer strips compared to the clearcuts. The changes in bryophyte cover and in species composition were smaller in the buffer strips, and the species that were negatively affected in the clearcuts were less affected in the buffer strips. However, there was a significant change in species composition in the buffer strips compared to the references. Substrate form. and taxonomic group were important factors in understanding this turnover. Many species growing on substrates with a convex form (e.g., logs, tree bases, and mesic ground) decreased or disappeared, while species on concave substrates were rather unaffected. This held for both mosses and liverworts, although liverworts were generally more sensitive than mosses. The difference in response of assemblages on convex vs. concave substrates makes changes in microclimate due to logging a likely explanation. The species in most need of protection (i.e., the red-listed species) were among the ones with strongest declines in the 20 m wide buffer strips. In order to function optimally for bryophyte conservation, forests along small streams need to be protected from high wind-throw frequency and strong edge effects. Increasing the width of buffer strips at sites with known or potential values (e.g., large amounts of woody debris or boulders) should be considered a better strategy than using narrow buffer strips with a fixed width.

AB  - Aquaculture expansion is a political priority in Norway, despite simmering conflicts, and competing claims. We expand on this hypothesis and analyze the Norwegian governance system by adding stakeholder theory in case of a simulated model of the effects of municipal coastal zone planning in the municipality of Froya, Norway. One cannot analyze the governance system in Norway without fully comprehending the perspectives of the stakeholders involved. Different stakeholders will react and respond differently and have conflicting presumptions basing their actions toward the planning process for coastal areas. They will also have different levels of power and abilities to influence the system. The article presents the interdisciplinary, first generation development of an agent based simulation model that mimics the outcomes of coastal zone planning for a stakeholder groups, the commercial fishers and the aquaculture industry, based on qualitative input from legislation, regulations, and stakeholder workshops. We proceed with verifying the applicability of this simulator in light of the key actors involved, namely the commercial fishers. We found that the simulator had two outcomes for the commercial fishers that were consistently recurring, namely "collapse" and "stability," based on the simulated occurrences of complaints by the stakeholders, with the latter being the de facto perceptions of actuality by the commercial fishers. Using stakeholder theory, we argue that the aquaculture industry's role has the saliency of an Important Stakeholder in Froya has steered the commercial fishers, who has the role of Dependent Stakeholders according to stakeholder theory, to no longer see any legitimacy in the process in that their complaints were never upheld because of their lack of the attribute Power.

AB  - This paper deals with the relation between protection of land and local and regional development through a power and democracy perspective on planning. A Swedish case is used to illustrate the connection between planning, local power and local development, with reference to tourism in a Nordic context. When areas are protected, planning automatically becomes centralized, taking the planning process out of the hands of the local authorities. Within these state territories of set rules, regulations and institutionalized systems - eco-protectorates - the local population becomes powerless when it comes to making decisions about land-use and is unable to engage in economically viable tourism enterprises because of centralized decision-making. Even in nature-based tourism where the quality of nature is important, it could therefore be more advantageous to have access to non-protected land for nature tourism. This is even more so because the idea of regional and local development often appears to have been "attached" as an afterthought or pious wish to the central planning documents. With genuine intention to stimulate local and regional development, protection should itself be based on geographical awareness and sensitivity to the diverse conditions in which such development is visualized. Local initiatives regarding land-use and protection do not have to be in conflict with national and international ambitions and regulations but they easily can be.

AB  - An increasing complexity is seen in global governance systems for forests, with multiple policy processes providing binding and non-binding commitments and partly conflicting objectives. This paper intends to contribute to clarifying domestic influences of global initiatives, by an exploratory contrasting of two alternative analytical perspectives. For the first perspective, regime effects, two cases of policy changes in Norway revealed variation in effects depending on the scope of analysis and reference points used for measurement. Compared to a situation with no regime, an effect is revealed for the climate regime, while for biodiversity, the effect is uncertain. For problem-solving achievements, both cases of policy change indicate difficulties in determining effects, due to ambiguity in regime objectives. The initial contrasting of regime effects with global governance influences, the second perspective, find that these are incompatible concepts, with the governance influences encompassing broader sources of influences and their dynamic interactions. The explorations point to the need for clarity in what is the topic under study (effect of one or more regimes, or governance influences) and to the analytical delimitations (regime obligations, process-generated effects of regime, broader regime consequences, or governance influences). Finally, promising topics for extending our understanding of national-global interactions are identified.

AB  - Corvids, mainly Hooded Crows (Corvus cornix L.) and Rooks (Corvus frugilegus L.) have colonised and spread in many European cities in recent decades. They are often considered as pests due to their noise, littering, aggression to humans and pets, and predation on birds of urban environments. Consequently, the control and/or management of corvids may become necessary in many cities in the future. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different trap types in catching crows and rooks in an urban environment. We experimentally tested four types of traps in the winter of 2014: bow net, Larsen trap, Swedish trap, and ladder entrance trap. As bait, we used bread, meat, fish, and live decoy birds. In 269 trap-days, we captured 23 Hooded Crows (with three birds recaptured 10 times), 34 Rooks (three recaptured 11 times), and 3 Magpies. The side-opening Larsen trap (0.46 captures/trap-day) and the ladder entrance trap (0.37) were the most effective. We caught only juvenile Hooded Crows, and both juvenile and adult Rooks, likely related to the wariness of adult crows. If a bird was captured in one type of trap, it was never recaptured in that type of trap. Our study suggests that trapping may be an effective way to catch crows and rooks and that some trap types may be more efficient than others. We present detailed guidelines for trapping, which will be useful in environmental management, urban planning and development, nature conservation and wildlife management.

AB  - Modification, fragmentation and loss of boreal forest habitats have been intensive during the last century due to forestry practises and land use. This has been related to population declines of many forest species, yet the mechanisms affecting on the background are largely unknown. The willow tit, a primary cavity-nesting species that was once the 4th most common bird species in Finland is nowadays endangered. Earlier findings suggest that the willow tit population is affected by the reduction of nesting sites, decaying snags in forests and the loss of mature forests which contain the food storages during the winter. In this study we are searching for the mechanisms how the forest management methods could explain the decline of the willow tit population. We used long-term breeding data of the willow tit nesting sites from 1990 to 2020 collected in a study area in northern Finland to analyse if forest management affected nearest neighbour distances and natal dispersal and breeding dispersal distances. We used Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to combine the ecological breeding data to accurate spatial forest management and habitat quality data. The data was analysed with linear mixed models. We found that clear-cuttings affected the willow tit dispersal and neighbouring nest distances more than thinnings. Both clear-cuttings and thinnings increased the nearest neighbour distances. The natal and breeding dispersal distances were lengthened by increasing proportions of clear-cuttings. The habitat loss caused by clear-cuttings and the decrease in habitat quality caused by thinnings has had a major role in the decline of the willow tit population. The forest management actions were estimated to explain about 65 % of the willow tit breeding density decrease in the study area. The effects of forest management were witnessed in a cumulative 0-30-year period meaning that forest management causes long-term habitat degradation and loss. Availability of deciduous snags in the forests can compensate the habitat loss to some extent by providing better breeding opportunities. As the effects of clear-cutting were more severe to the willow tit than thinning, we recommend using other forest management methods than clear-cutting as the main management method.

AB  - The White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), one of the rarest European woodpeckers, is an old-growth deciduous forest specialist which has shown widespread decline over most of its distribution range. In this study, I extend earlier analyses concerning range contraction and explore whether there exists a threshold in the amount of suitable habitat below which the species will not persist, and if there is a nonlinear decline in population size as suitable habitat in the forest landscape is reduced. A metapopulation model was parameterized with data from a stable population and an analytical estimated extinction threshold was tested on two data sets on population decline and range contraction.
   The species disappears from regions when the amount of deciduous forest declines below a certain level. One isolated Swedish sub-population, which had withdrawn to a forest-landscape with resources below the habitat threshold, became extinct in 1996. The two other Swedish sub-populations are in forest landscapes below the minimum habitat threshold and both these populations are declining. Finnish sub-populations persist in a landscape below the habitat threshold, however. Reanalyzing data for Finland indicates a time delay in population response as habitat is destroyed and when the amount of suitable habitat falls below 10% there is an accelerated decline in population size; Tn today's intensively managed forests in Sweden and Finland, with low proportions of suitable habitat in the forest landscape, the immediate danger for the species is that the population will suffer from isolation.

AB  - Root rot in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) causes substantial economic losses to the forestry sector. In this study, we developed a probability model for decay at breast height utilizing 18,141 increment cores sampled on temporary plots of the Norwegian National Forest Inventory. The final model showed a good fit to the data and retained significant relationships between decay and a suite of tree, stand and site variables, including diameter at breast height, stand age, altitude, growing season temperature sum (threshold 5 degrees C), and vegetation type. By comparing model predictions with recorded decay at stump height in an independent data set, we estimated a proportionality function to adjust for the inherent underestimation of total rot that will be obtained by applying a probability model derived from increment cores sampled at breast height. We conclude that the developed model is appropriate for national and regional scenario analyses in Norway, and could also be useful as a tool for operational forestry planning. This would however require further testing on independent data, to assess how well the new model predicts decay at local scales.

AB  - Heritage conservation and management of landscapes is evident in many recent European policies and national reports on the state of the environment. To assist in the management of heritage resources, we present a landscape approach to the identification of localities with a high probability of possessing cultural heritage interests. The low proportion of sites registered in Norway (an estimated 20%) combined with current rates of damage gives the location of archaeological sites and their vulnerability to land use change high priority. To optimise use of the results for landscape planning, the study describes analysis at two hierarchical scales: (1) the regional level-where the aim was to locate combinations of environmental resources suitable for human use-for application in strategic planning; and (2) the landscape level-where identifying and delimiting cultural environments for local planning was the aim. This paper focuses on one type of archaeological site, Bronze and Iron Age grave mounds. The project used geographic information systems (GIS) for the analysis and mapping of landscape characteristics that indicate zones with a high probability of possessing cultural heritage interest. These zones covered ca. 12% of the forested areas of the region yet captured 94% of the registered grave mounds. New fieldwork confirmed the presence of new sites in the zones identified. Results have increased our understanding of archaeological site location in Norway and the close links between landscape ecology and archaeology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transportation plays a key role in urban sustainability planning and urban greenhouse gas emission reductions. Globally, cities have established sustainability agendas and policies to guide the shift from traditional private automobile dependent transportation systems towards an increased use of public transportation, cycling, and walking. While the surrounding physical urban form and governance structures condition public transportation services, there are also many other factors to consider when discussing sustainability. As such, comprehensive planning and policy-oriented assessment frameworks that are independent of local conditions are still largely missing in literature. This paper presents a Public Transportation Sustainability Indicator List (PTSIL) that provides a platform for an integrated assessment of environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability through an indicator-based approach. To demonstrate its use, the PTSIL is applied to analyze the policy documents of public transportation agencies in Helsinki, Finland, and Toronto, Canada. The results show that while both cities achieve relatively high scores in all dimensions, there is still high variability among individual indicators. The PTSIL presents a missed stepping stone between descriptive definitions of transportation sustainability and case specific sustainability performance assessments, offering an opportunity within the planning and policy-making sectors to review, assess, and develop public transportation services comprehensively.

AB  - Logging and modern forest management reduced the frequency of key features of old-growth forest, especially old, dying and dead trees in the Scandinavian boreal forest during the 20th century. To quantify the decline and spatial differences, we have analysed density changes of old trees between 1926 and 1996 on a regional scale (approximately 50,000 kin 2) in boreal Sweden. The occurrence of old-conifer trees (+159 years) has dramatically decreased in the studied area and today only one third as many old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) can be found as in the 1920s. However, the density of old deciduous trees (+99 years) has not decreased since the early 20th century. Historical baseline data such as these are needed for modern forest management, conservation programmes and ecological restoration projects. Existing old trees are very important for biodiversity, and may also preserve elements of cultural heritage from pre-industrial times. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CP  - Symposium on Innovative Silviculture Systems in Boreal Forests
AB  - A "green revolution" has quietly taken place within Swedish forestry. Large-scale forestry operations,featuring clearcuts and standardized regeneration methods are being replaced by site-adapted operations. An ecological, holistic approach is gradually permeating day-to-day forestry work with the realization that respect for nature is just as important as timber production. At AssiDoman we give equal weigh: to environmental and production goals. Thr management goals of AssiDoman are: 1) to achieve a high and sustainable economic yield, 2) to sustain the production capacity of timberlands and 3) to preserve the biological diversify of the forest. These goals can be integrated. One prerequisite is that operations within each individual area are adapted to the particular natural and productive conditions of that area and its environmental values.
   Since 1990, we have conducted a broad training program for our forest workers within the "green" sector. Today the regeneration planning is carried out by the machine operators of the logging crews. This allows for concordance between planning and realization.
   The results are followed up and presented in an ecological balance-sheet which is based on apt inventory of about 200 randomly-selected final felling each year. In 1994, AssiDoman presented its first-ever ecological balance-sheet for the day-to-day forestry operations. Within a few, years the balance-sheet will also reflect our ecological performance at the landscape level.

AB  - The bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) are important pollinators in many ecosystems, but their diversity has declined in Europe during the past century, mainly due to habitat loss. However, some of the habitat requirements of wild bees are met in anthropogenic landscape elements, such as road sides, power-line strips and field edges. Moreover, as the bee species assemblages change throughout the season the habitat requirements of the bee fauna may change accordingly. Understanding such seasonally distinct responses of solitary bees with different phenologies may be of high value for local conservation planning. The purpose of this study was to examine if the habitat quality of field edges for solitary bees change throughout the season, and how this temporal variation relates to local habitat and landscape conditions. By sampling solitary bees in 18 field edges in southeast Norway throughout the season we found that the species richness and abundance of bees was highest in sun exposed field edges, independently of the season. However, we found phenologically distinct responses to the landscape context. Moreover, field edges situated in landscapes with a high proportion of forests and semi-natural landscape elements hosted the most phenologically diverse bee species assemblages. We conclude that in order to fulfil the habitat requirements of bee species assemblages throughout the season, one should conserve and direct habitat restoration schemes towards increasing sun exposure at field edges with a diverse flora and a high proportion of semi-natural areas in the vicinity.

AB  - We analyzed the applicability of forest planning data in predicting the occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) in managed northern boreal forests, in northeast Finland. Forest planning data is a source of information about forest characteristics for forest managers that may be used in estimating the availability of certain habitats for species conservation. Flying squirrel populations have declined in Finland, most probably due to habitat change and loss and maintenance of suitable habitats can be seen as a fundamental task in species conservation. First, we Surveyed 715 ha of older spruce-dominated forest consisting of 91 stands, of which 35 were found occupied by flying squirrel. Flying squirrels inhabited larger stands, which had a higher volume of spruce and birch. Occupied stands also had more good quality forests surrounding them than the unoccupied stands. We based the model building on already existing knowledge of the habitat preferences of the species and built four alternative predictive models with logistic regression. Forest planning data seemed useful in estimating the forest quality and the Suitability of habitats for the flying squirrel, with a model fit of ca. 72% with the original data. Second, we built the predictive models similarly with data from another study area (n = 98) situating ca. 150 km south from the first area. Third, we evaluated the first models using data of the second study area and also using new independent data from three municipalities situating almost in between the two study areas. Moreover, we reciprocally evaluated one model of the second study area using data of the first study area and of the three municipalities. The prediction success of our models indicated some applicability to other areas. The results also showed that the structure of the surrounding landscape is more important in a coarse-grained landscape than in a fine-grained landscape. However, because of some inaccuracies, predictive occupancy models built for the flying squirrel cannot replace field surveys and their generalizations to other areas must be made with caution.

AB  - Global attention has focused on how to utilize wood resources with less impact on ecological services generated by forests, and governments are restructuring the subsidy system to achieve effective resource governance. We examined (1) the changes in wood utilization against growing wood stock among high-income countries; (2) regional differences in the Norwegian wood stock and its utilization and (3) the allocation system of public subsidies for forestry under the request of balance between wood production and conservation of forests in Norway. The utilization rate of wood differed significantly between the eastern and central-western regions of the country (P<0.01), but there was no significant difference in the growing wood stock per ha (127.7 +/- 10.9 m(3) ha(-1) in the eastern region and 119.2 +/- 21.1 m(3) ha(-1) in the central-western region). The difference in utilization status was significantly correlated with the share of harvestable forest areas located in steeper slopes (r=-0.935, P<0.001) and the forest road density (r=0.735, P<0.01). The government strategically implemented both financial support and regulations in each region on the basis of regional differences in wood resource conditions. As is the most of the western countries, Norway faced the competition between conservation and production of forests, and terminated public subsidy for forest in 2003. However, because a change in utilization of Norwegian wood stock (-2.2% yr(-1)) was one of the lowest values among the high-income group between 1990 and 2005, the subsidy was recovered and targeted to galvanize wood production with guidelines of mitigating environmental degradation. The proper allocation of both incentives and disincentives for forest management is pivotal to achieve the sustainable utilization of wood resources in developed countries, which might alleviate the transfer of environmental burden to developing nations through trade.

AB  - Eurasian lynx are often regarded as being particularly sensitive to human land-use. However, in the European context where human influence is pervasive, the conservation of lynx requires that they be integrated into the human-dominated landscape. Although previous studies have looked at how lynx respond to human land-use in a broad sense, they have failed to examine the details of how different types of human induced impacts (forest fragmentation, human density, different types of transport infrastructure) influence distinct lynx behaviors. Furthermore, they have not examined the extent to which lynx modify their fine scaled avoidance behavior of anthropogenic landscape features according to the specific behaviors (resting sites, kill sites, movement) in which they are engaged and how these relationships are modified by prey density or the sex of the lynx. We used Resource Selection Functions to examine how 19 GPS-marked lynx in southeastern Norway responded to an index of cumulative human habitat modification while engaged in different activities. We found that lynx select for areas with medium levels of human modification, avoiding both the very highly modified and the areas with low degrees of modification. Females in general appear to be less tolerant of human modification than males, especially when it comes to resting sites. Terrain (ruggedness and elevation) appears to be important in permitting lynx to exploit heavily modified areas. Our study demonstrates that lynx show a nuanced response to human habitat modification, which offers hope for their conservation in Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the relationship between landscape composition and capercaillie density in 50 km x 50 km grids in Finland, where modem forestry started in the 1950s and most of the forests are in commercial use. Capercaillie density was positively associated with the young thinning stand proportion throughout the country, but unlike in numerous older studies, it wasn't positively associated with the mature stand proportion in any part of the country. In central Finland this relationship was even negative. In central and southern Finland capercaillie density was associated positively with the forest land proportion, and negatively with the open area proportion. Results suggest that the overall amount of the forest cover is important for the capercaillie, and that clear-cut areas in the 1950s and 1960s, known as 'large age classes', have developed as suitable for them. A new aspect based on results is the potential reduction in the mature forest quality as capercaillie habitats.

AB  - This study explores the implications of improved access to national rail and road infrastructure for urban planning and land use in two small Swedish towns. The promotion of sustainable mobility is considered a strategic objective at the municipal level, yet the study questions the extent to which national investments, and increased access to regional labour markets, support local efforts to increase sustainable mobility. The results indicate that municipalities struggle to adopt coherent approaches to increasing sustainable mobility and continue to develop physical plans that induce use of motor vehicles, a trend reinforced by national investments in road infrastructure in peri-urban areas.

AB  - This paper summarizes the objectives, activities initiated and approaches used in developing Atlantic salmon stock re-building programmes in three large river systems in northern Finland in order to identify the priorities for research and management for further restoration and rehabilitation steps. Until recently, these historically renowned major salmon rivers have been harnessed for hydropower for 4060 years without provisions for fish passage. Hydropower companies are obliged to compensate for the losses caused by dam construction by annual fish releases, including juveniles of Atlantic salmon and migratory brown trout. Returning fish are harvested in the designated terminal fishery areas at river mouths. Recently, activities aimed at restoring salmonid stocks have started in all these rivers. First fishways at the dams closest to the river mouths were constructed on two rivers, and preliminary projects were completed to review the preconditions for restoration, options for bypassing the dams, and to study the performance of these fishways. New projects incorporating further detailed fishway planning are underway. The various projects have proved successful in bringing together authorities, hydropower companies, local organizations, and expertise from various institutions for a joint effort to tackle these multifaceted and multidisciplinary problems.

AB  - We examined the behavioral response to habitat loss and fragmentation of willow tits (Parus montanus) in winter in a mosaic forest landscape in northern Finland. We studied habitat preference, flock size and home range size of 16 flocks, half of which had their territories in forests fragmented by forestry and half in continuous forest. We predicted that birds would respond to habitat loss by enlarging their home range and/or diminishing group size. In addition, to compensate for fragmentation effects, willow tits might be expected to include more optimal habitat into their territories. Flocks included on average 3.9 birds and occupied territories of 12.6 ha. Willow tits avoided open areas (clear cuts and young sapling stands) and preferred mature forests and older sapling stands or pine bogs equally. Birds responded to habitat loss by enlarging their home ranges but not by reducing the group size. Large territories included a smaller proportion of mature forests, but the proportion of sapling and pine bog habitat did not change. Birds on territories that included a large proportion of open habitat localized their activity on several distinct habitat patches that were distributed over a wide area. We conclude that willow tits adjust territory use to compensate for the inclusion of unsuitable habitat within home ranges, and older sapling areas and pine bogs serve as surrogates for mature forests. However, birds did not enlarge the proportion of forest habitat in their territories with increasing habitat loss. Thus, our data do not suggest a strong effect of fragmentation, but imply that forestry practices reduce suitable wintering habitat and carrying capacity in the area. Thus winter habitat loss may explain the observed population decline of willow tits in Finland during recent decades.

AB  - In order to safeguard biodiversity in forest we need to know how forest policy instruments work. Here we use a nationwide network of 9400 plots in productive forest to analyze to what extent large-scale policy instruments, individually and together, target forest of high conservation value in Norway. We studied both instruments working through direct regulation; Strict Protection and Landscape Protection, and instruments working through management planning and voluntary schemes of forest certification; Wilderness Area and Mountain Forest. As forest of high conservation value (HCV-forest) we considered the extent of 12 Biodiversity Habitats and the extent of Old-Age Forest. We found that 22% of productive forest area contained Biodiversity Habitats. More than 70% of this area was not covered by any large-scale instruments. Mountain Forest covered 23%, while Strict Protection and Wilderness both covered 5% of the Biodiversity Habitat area. A total of 9% of productive forest area contained Old-Age Forest, and the relative coverage of the four instruments was similar as for Biodiversity Habitats. For all instruments, except Landscape Protection, the targeted areas contained significantly higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas not targeted by these instruments. Areas targeted by Strict Protection had higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas targeted by other instruments, except for areas targeted by Wilderness Area which showed similar proportions of Biodiversity Habitats. There was a substantial amount of spatial overlap between the policy tools, but no incremental conservation effect of overlapping instruments in terms of contributing to higher percentages of targeted HCV-forest. Our results reveal that although the current policy mix has an above average representation of forest of high conservation value, the targeting efficiency in terms of area overlap is limited. There is a need to improve forest conservation and a potential to cover this need by better targeting high conservation value areas.

AB  - Climate change, land-use change and introductions of non-native species are key determinants of biodiversity change worldwide. However, the extent to which anthropogenic drivers of environmental change interact to affect biological communities is largely unknown, especially over longer time periods. Here, we show that plant community composition in 996 Swedish landscapes has consistently shifted to reflect the warmer and wetter climate that the region has experienced during the second half of the 20th century. Using community climatic indices, which reflect the average climatic associations of the species within each landscape at each time period, we found that species compositions in 74% of landscapes now have a higher representation of warm-associated species than they did previously, while 84% of landscapes now host more species associated with higher levels of precipitation. In addition to a warmer and wetter climate, there have also been large shifts in land use across the region, while the fraction of non-native species has increased in the majority of landscapes. Climatic warming at the landscape level appeared to favour the colonization of warm-associated species, while also potentially driving losses in cool-associated species. However, the resulting increases in community thermal means were apparently buffered by landscape simplification (reduction in habitat heterogeneity within landscapes) in the form of increased forest cover. Increases in non-native species, which generally originate from warmer climates than Sweden, were a strong driver of community-level warming. In terms of precipitation, both landscape simplification and increases in non-natives appeared to favour species associated with drier climatic conditions, to some extent counteracting the climate-driven shift towards wetter communities. Anthropogenic drivers can act both synergistically and antagonistically to determine trajectories of change in biological communities over time. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple drivers of global change when trying to understand, manage and predict biodiversity in the future.

AB  - Wetlands are one of the world's most important, economically valuable, and diverse ecosystems. A major proportion of wetland biodiversity is composed of aquatic invertebrates, which are essential for secondary production in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Urban areas have intensified the challenges wetlands encounter by increasing the area of impermeable surfaces and the levels of nutrient and pollutant overflows. We investigated how urban infrastructure affects the aquatic invertebrate fauna of urban wetlands in metropolitan Helsinki, southern Finland. We measured riparian canopy cover, emergent vegetation coverage, and various land cover and road variables. Recreation area, forests, and open natural areas were the most important landscape features positively influencing aquatic invertebrate family richness, whereas buildings and roads had a negative effect on family richness and abundances of many taxa. Recreation area and the various forest types also positively affected the alpha-diversity indices of wetlands. On the other hand, fish assemblage did not affect either family richness or abundances of the studied taxa. Furthermore, trees growing on the shoreline negatively affected the diversity of aquatic invertebrate families. Invertebrate family diversity was greatest at well-connected wetlands, as these areas added to the regional species pool by over 33%. Our results show that connectivity and green areas near wetlands increase aquatic invertebrate family diversity, and our results could be utilized in urban planning.

AB  - The conflicts and potential trade-offs between renewable energy development and nature protection are evident in policies aimed at promoting windpower, particularly in nature areas under high pressure from human activities. However, surprisingly little is known about the influence of political steering on windpower licensing practices. This article examines how political steering has affected the weight accorded to environmental considerations in the licensing practices of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). We find that the NVE enjoys significant discretion in interpreting and implementing political decisions, and that the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (OED) has not provided clear steering signals regarding nature protection. Political pressures for expanded renewable energy production are reflected in the significant attention paid to economic and technical considerations in the licensing process. We conclude that ministerial steering signals and the NVE's technocratic culture have pushed in the same direction: greater development of windpower, at the expense of transparent and predictable consideration for nature concerns.

AB  - For decades Brazil has faced a dilemma based on a perceived dichotomy between natural preservation and economic progress. Since 1988, more than 446,000 km2 of native land has been cleared by clearcutting in Brazilian Legal Amazon alone, an area comparable to Sweden. In addition to the biodiversity loss associated with this activity, it is a significant global warming source since more than 72% of gross CO2e emissions of Brazil come from land use, land-use change, forestry, and agriculture. As such, the national commitment to reduce green-house gas emissions by 37% by 2025 and 43% by 2030, with respect to 2005 levels, is likely to be at risk. Here, a simulation model has been created to provide decision-makers with knowledge about the future of Brazilian farming production in deforestation, neutral net land-use change, and reforestation scenarios. It has been found that farming demand and capital supply impact farming production significantly more than land availability. If reforestation policies to 2005 natural coverage levels were to be implemented, there would be no significant differences in Brazilian major farming crop production to a reference scenario of continuous deforestation. However, this would be at the expense of secondary crops usually earmarked for the domestic market. For Brazil to preserve its natural coverage, it must also inevitably improve crop productivity, especially in the Northeast region, while also being cognizant of the impact on domestic food prices. Lastly, Brazil needs to have incentives to foster intensive livestock farming. These results provide evidence that can support policies towards the profitable and sustainable scenarios described in the simulations.

AB  - The temporal changes and spatial variability of phosphorus and nitrogen losses and concentrations in Finland during the period 1981-1997 were studied in 15 small agricultural and forested catchments. In addition, four coastal river basins with high agricultural land use located in southern Finland were included in the study in order to assess the representativeness of agricultural loss estimates from small agricultural catchments. The mean annual loss specific for agricultural land was estimated to be on average 110 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1500 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from small agricultural catchments were in agreement with the corresponding loss estimates from rivers, with an average of 137 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total phosphorus and 1800 kg km(-2) a(-1) for total nitrogen. The results from the studied agricultural catchments and rivers during the period 1981-1997 suggest that weather-driven fluctuation in discharge was usually the main reason for changes in nutrient losses, and little or no impact of changes in agricultural production or management practises can be observed. In forested areas the total phosphorus loss (average 9 kg km(-2) a(-1)) and total nitrogen loss (average 250 kg km(-2) a(-1)) were lower than in agricultural areas. In forested catchments the impact of forestry operations, such as clear-cutting and fertilization, and the impact of atmospheric nitrogen deposition can be seen in changes in nutrient losses.

AB  - During the last few decades many European countries have developed policies directed towards mineral deposit safeguarding. However, as other land uses often are in conflict with mineral deposit safeguarding, the implementation of these policies is many times more difficult in practice. The aim of this paper is to investigate the link between land use planning and mineral resources, when using a shared value perspective. The analysis is focused on the mineral-rich Nordic countries-Sweden, Norway and Finland-and a number of mining projects are analyzed. The analysis rests in Porter and Kramer's arguments for the importance of creating shared values. The results indicate that a shared value perspective has been present in the analyzed case studies, as many of the key ways for creating shared value are identified in the projects. This illustrates the importance of linking social value to economic value in mining projects, even if this is not clearly stated in the relevant legislation. As it is often the unpredictability of the regulatory framework that hinders mineral extraction, it is suggested that Social Impact Assessments (or similar) are formalized in the regulatory framework to ensure that social value is linked more clearly to the land use process related to access to minerals.

AB  - Over the last decades, dramatic changes in agricultural practices have led to important modifications of land-use, as well as landscape structure, and to a general biodiversity loss in agro-ecosystems. During 2008 we investigated the small mammal communities of Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) stands in Northern Italy. We live-trapped small mammals, during summer and autumn, in different types of SRF stands and surrounding habitats and compared capture rates. We evaluated the influence on small mammals abundance of the distance between the stands and other habitats offering woody or bushy cover. Our results showed that SRF plantations are widely exploited by small mammals, especially in autumn and that capture rate is the highest in "double-row" stands. The distance from woods or other arboriculture stands was negatively correlated to small mammals abundance. We conclude that SRF plantations can be considered a suitable habitat for small mammals and may work as a "corridor habitat" between fragmented patches of suitable habitats.

AB  - Strategic spatial planning has been suggested as a means for environmental sustainability. However, there are significant challenges with operationalising and integrating policy-driven strategic spatial planning within the standardised and process-oriented management systems of local authorities. This aspect has motivated discussions on how implementation of strategic spatial planning with a focus on environmental sustainability is conditioned by management systems. The empirical case is local planning and management practices in a local authority in Sweden. Interviews with planners, together with planning and policy documents, make up the empirical material. The analysis proposes that the integration of environmental perspectives into strategic spatial planning processes depends on (i) the overall concerns for environmental issues in local policy, and (ii) how administrative management systems can facilitate transformative practice in planning. In conclusion, this article illustrates how environmental sustainability in strategic spatial planning is formed and conditioned through interplay between local policy and administrative management procedures.

AB  - In the paper, the author argues that cultural strategies and theories about urban planning may be irrelevant or even counterproductive outside urban and suburban contexts. In many rural settings the problem is not the destruction of the cultural heritage or how to counterbalance the influence from corporate interests, but rather the absence of such interests in the first place. From a study of two rural municipalities in southern Norway, the author demonstrates that culture-led strategies may be more of a distraction than an instrument for creating economic growth. Measured by the common goals for rural development in Norway, the cultural strategy has only been a success in one of the cases, whereas in the other case ideas about culture-led redevelopment have not prevented economic and demographic decline. The author concludes that while culture can be instrumental in creating growth in rural municipalities, it might also hamper their development.

AB  - The remnants of primeval Norway spruce forests in the European temperate zone are crucial for maintaining forest biodiversity in high mountain landscapes. This paper presents results of a multidisciplinary research and evaluation project on the management practices for mountain spruce forests in the Natura 2000 site (National Nature Reserve Serak-Keprnik in the Hruby Jesenik Mountains, the Czech Republic). Results are based on combining research on the historical development of the forest ecosystem and predictions of future dynamics using a forest growth simulation model. The presented results show that a non-intervention management strategy for mountain spruce forest in the next 50 years complies with the Natura 2000 requirement to maintain the existing character of the forest habitat. Thus, the results indicate that the current management plan for the spruce forests does not require significant corrections in the context of its conservation goals (i.e., maintaining biodiversity and current character of the forest ecosystem dominated by Norway spruce). The results of this study suggest that combining the knowledge of historical development with forest inventory data using forest growth simulation represents a suitable support tool for the assessment of management practices for forest habitats in protected areas.

AB  - In many national guidelines and policies regarding protection of freshwater systems from stressors associated with forestry, riparian buffer width is a commonly prescribed strategy, typically with no other refinements of protection measures. In Sweden, the Strategic Management Objectives (SMOs) were developed to ensure that riparian buffers that are left after harvesting sustain important ecosystem attributes in aquatic systems, referred to as objectives, namely shading, biodiversity, reduction of sedimentation, and provision of deadwood and food. However, little specification is given on threshold targets or how to manage riparian zones to effectively provide these objectives. In this paper, we evaluated whether existing riparian buffers of different widths along small, recently harvested (<8 years) streams were able to provide proxies of these targeted objectives, and further compared harvested streams to counterparts situated in mature unharvested production forests (reference) in northern and southern Sweden. The influence of buffer width varied with objective and geographic location. In both regions, canopy cover (proxy for shading) increased with riparian width, and riparian deadwood was highest in no buffer sites. Organic matter (OM; proxy for food) was highest in the northern no buffer streams, while in the south OM increased with buffer width. All other parameters tested had no relationship to buffer width. These differing responses even in streams subjected to similar land-use and management within a close vicinity and region, suggest that the contemporary strategy of prescribing fixed buffer widths and/or stating objectives without defined guidelines for what constitutes an effective riparian buffer is insufficient given the large variability of stream ecosystems across small spatial scales. More comprehensive consideration synergistically accounting for site-specificity and land mosaic planning are needed to develop functionally effective buffers that can mitigate forestry impacts on stream ecosystems.

AB  - Culturally modified trees, or CMTs, are a phenomenon of forest-dwelling peoples worldwide, front North America to Scandinavia, to Turkey, to Australia. Living trees front which materials are harvested (edible inner bark, pitch and resin, bark, branches), or Which are modified through coppicing and pollarding to produce wood of a certain size and quality, or which are marked in some way for purposes of art, ceremony, or to indicate boundary lines or trails, all represent the potential of sustainable use and management of trees and forested regions. Often their use is associated with particular belief systems or approaches to other lifeforms that result in conservation of standing trees and forests, and preserving or enhancing their habitat value and productivity, even while they serve as resources for people. Various types of culturally modified trees have religious or spiritual significance, tying people to their ancestors who used the trees before them, and signifying traditional use and occupancy of a given region. Although some CMTs are legally protected to some extent in some jurisdictions, many are at risk from industrial forestry, urban expansion and clearing land for agriculture, and immense numbers of CMTs front past centuries and decades have already been destroyed. The diverse types, and the patterns of CMT creation and use, need further study; these trees, collectively, are an important part of our human heritage.

AB  - Aim We examined the responses of the beta diversity of aquatic and terrestrial beetles to ecogeographical variables, including climate, land cover and land use, across Northern Europe. Location Northern Europe (Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland). Methods Information on the occurrence of ground beetles and diving beetles across Northern European biogeographical provinces was collated from literature sources. Beta diversity was examined using Jaccard dissimilarity coefficient as well as its replacement and richness difference components. Each of the three dissimilarity matrices (responses) was modelled using various ecogeographical variables (predictors) by generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). Results The magnitude of total beta diversity was relatively similar between ground beetles and diving beetles, but the richness difference component contributed more than the replacement component to total beta diversity in ground beetles, whereas the opposite was true for diving beetles. The predictor variables most influential in GDM in accounting for spatial variation in beta diversity varied between the two beetle groups as well as between the replacement and richness difference components. In general, the richness difference component of ground beetles responded strongly to latitude and associated climatic variables, whereas the replacement component of diving beetles varied strongly along the same geographical gradient. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the study of the determinants of biodiversity patterns benefits from the partitioning of beta diversity into different components and from comparing terrestrial and aquatic groups. For example, our findings suggest that the strong climatic and land use-related gradients in beta diversity have important implications for predicting and mitigating the effect of ongoing global change on the composition of regional biotas.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are essential to prevent further biodiversity loss yet their effectiveness varies largely with governance and external threats. Although methodological advances have permitted assessments of PA effectiveness in mitigating deforestation, we still lack similar studies for the impact of PAs on wildlife populations. Here we use an innovative combination of matching methods and hurdle-mixed models with a large-scale and long-term dataset for Finland's large carnivore species. We show that the national PA network does not support higher densities than non-protected habitat for 3 of the 4 species investigated. For some species, PA effects interact with region or time, i.e., wolverine densities decreased inside PAs over the study period and lynx densities increased inside eastern PAs. We support the application of matching methods in combination of additional analytical frameworks for deeper understanding of conservation impacts on wildlife populations. These methodological advances are crucial for preparing ambitious PA targets post-2020. Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas for wildlife conservation is challenging. Here, Terraube et al. combine statistical matching and hurdle mixed-effects models to show that PAs have limited impact on population densities of large carnivores across Finland.

AB  - One of the main goals in nature conservation and land use planning is to identify areas important for biodiversity. One possible cost-effective surrogate for deriving appropriate estimates of spatial patterns of species richness is provided by predictive modeling based on remote sensing and topographic data. Using bird species richness data from a spatial grid system (105 squares of 0.25 km(2) within an area of 26.25 km(2)), we tested the usefulness of Landsat TM satellite-based remote sensing and topographic data in bird species richness modeling in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in southwestern Finland. We built generalized linear models for the bird species richness and validated the accuracy of the models with an independent test area of 50 grid squares (12.5 km(2)). We evaluated separately the modeling performance of habitat structure, habitat composition, topographical-moisture variables and all variables in the model-building and model-test areas.
   Areas of high observed and predicted bird species richness in the boreal agricultural-forest mosaic were mainly concentrated along river valleys in the grid squares with a high habitat diversity and steep topography. This landscape type also has the highest cover of habitats important for nature conservation: seminatural grasslands, deciduous forests, and watercourses. The covers of deciduous forests and serninatural grassland were included as explanatory variables of the bird species richness model, although they both cover only about 5% of the land in the study area. When the four models were evaluated by fitting them to the model test area, the explanatory power of the topography-moisture model decreased clearly, whereas the habitat-composition, habitat-structure, and all-variables models were more rigorous. Finally, we extrapolated the models to the whole study area of 600 km(2) and produced bird species richness probability maps using GIS techniques.
   We conclude that, instead of scattered study plots in which birds are counted, predictive modeling requires large study areas where the variation within the whole landscape can be taken into account. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing data produces the most reliable data sets, which can be used when predicting species richness in other landscapes.

AB  - Many plants can persist in landscapes for a long time after focal habitats have disappeared or become fragmented, which might contribute to an extinction debt. Delayed responses of plant occurrence have recently received great attention, particularly in conservation, although evidence for extinction debts is incongruent. Here we asked if we could detect an extinction debt for plant species after 100 years of fragmentation, depending on regional or local (gamma or alpha respectively) diversity measure used, and if all plant species or only habitat specialists were investigated. Historical and contemporary grassland patterns were analysed in 33 rural landscapes (each 1 km(2) in diameter) in south-eastern Sweden. Results show that managed semi-natural grassland had declined from 39% to 3% in 100 years. Diversity measured at regional scale was best explained by grassland extent 100 years ago, for both all species and grassland specialists. Present-day management, but neither present nor past grassland extent, was important for grassland specialists' occurrence at the local scale, although present-day grassland proportion had a positive influence on species richness at the local scale. We found evidence of an extinction debt at both local and regional scale when all species were included in the analysis, but not for grassland specialist species at the local scale. However, the extinction debt is still to be settled for grassland specialists at the regional scale, and therefore the estimation of extinction debts in fragmented habitats presents one of the greatest challenges for conservation today and in the future.

AB  - Changes in land use during the last century have caused fragmentation and a reduction in area of many species-rich habitats in the hemiboreal region. We examined abundances of plant species and their occurrence in different habitats in south-east Sweden. We found 361 plant species in 146 sample sites, which represented 14 different types of habitat. Most species were rare and occurred only in a few habitats. Almost half of all species (49%) were found in one or two habitats. Of these, 99 species occurred in one habitat only. The habitats with largest number of restricted species, i.e. habitat specialists, were dry to mesic semi-natural grasslands and remnant habitats such as road verges and midfield islets. The occurrence of 52 species was analysed with respect to topography, top- and subsoil and land use history. Few of the 52 species were affected by aspect or type of topsoil. Subsoil affected nearly half of the species and habitats with a convex landform influenced occurrence of > 90% of the species. Seventeen species were positively associated with a long continuity of grassland management, whereas two species were associated with lack of management. Open grasslands that are encroached by trees and shrubs show a decline in species number. Deciduous forests, especially wet deciduous forests, have a potential for restoring moist to mesic grassland habitats. Small remnant habitats are important for many of the species restricted to semi-natural grasslands. These habitats may function as "rescue sites" for the species, which in turn may promote dispersal and increase likelihood of restoration success. Therefore, remnant habitats are important for maintaining and restoring species richness in rural landscapes.

AB  - Two aquatic moss species, Calliergon megalophyllum and Drepanocladus sordidus (Amblystegiaceae, Bryophyta), which had been considered extinct in the Czech Republic, were found in the Trebon Basin, South Bohemia, in 2016-2017. They co-occurred in extensive reed- and sedge-dominated fen pools with humic water on the shore of an old fishpond and the former species was also discovered in a small humic pool in an old shallow sand-pit. The new Czech sites of these rare boreal species represent one of the southernmost known outposts within their entire European range. Previously, the two species were only known from single records in the Czech Republic from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To confirm our morphological observations, we used phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence variation in four chloroplast loci (atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, rpl16, trnG) and one nuclear region, the internal transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA (ITS). We found (1) monophyly of all Calliergon megalophyllum specimens tested; (2) based on chloroplast DNA sequences, monophyly among all Drepanocladus sordidus specimens and representatives of Pseudocalliergon turgescens and P. lycopodioides moss species; (3) based on nuclear ITS sequences, monophyly of all original D. sordidus specimens. These results corroborate morphological studies and thus confirm the existence of natural sites for the studied moss species in the Trebon Basin, South Bohemia, Czech Republic.

AB  - Mitigating future forest risks, safeguarding timber revenues and improving biodiversity are key considerations for current boreal forest management. Alternatives to rotation forestry likely have an important role, but how they will perform under a changing climate remains unclear. We used a boreal forest growth simulator to explore how variations on traditional clear-cutting, in rotation length, thinning intensity, and increasing number of remaining trees after final harvest (green tree retention), and on extent of continuous cover forestry will affect stand-level probability of wind damage, timber production, deadwood volume, and habitats for forest species. We used business-as-usual rotation forestry as a baseline and compared alternative management adaptations under the reference and two climate change scenarios. Climate change increased overall timber production and had lower impacts on biodiversity compared to management adaptations. Shortening the rotation length reduced the probability of wind damage compared to business-as-usual, but also decreased both deadwood volume and suitable habitats for our focal species. Continuous cover forestry, and management with refraining from thinnings, and extension of rotation length represent complementary approaches benefiting biodiversity, with respective effects of improving timber revenues, reducing wind damage risk, and benefiting old-growth forest structures. However, extensive application of rotation length shortening to mitigate wind damage risk may be detrimental for forest biodiversity. To safeguard forest biodiversity over the landscape, shortening of the rotation length could be complemented with widespread application of regimes promoting old-growth forest structures.

AB  - Peatlands are significant to global efforts to combat climate change. However, to date, they have been a missing piece in the climate change mitigation policy puzzle in the European Union (EU). Taking a policy coherence perspective, we investigate how policies from different governance levels-that is, EU, member state, and regional levels-support and impede existing and new policies for climate-friendly peatland usage. We put a particular focus on incentive-based policy instruments, because such incentives are often advocated as promising policy instruments for supporting the transition to the sustainable management of peatlands. We selected the three peatland-rich EU countries Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Based on semi-structured interviews with 35 experts, we indicate a lack of horizontal policy coherence between agriculture, nature conservation, water management, forestry, energy, and climate policies in terms of climate change mitigation measures on peatlands. At the EU level, most prominently, the Common Agricultural Policy counteracts climate targets because direct payments currently encourage the unsustainable management of peatlands. At the national and subnational levels, water quality in Finland, nature conservation in Germany, and subsidence in the Netherlands were primary objectives of peatland relevant policies. Due to a lack of clear guidance on raising the groundwater table, the current incentive-based policy instruments are ineffective for reducing emissions. Despite its higher mitigation potential, potential incentive-based policies for rewetting encounter various regulatory barriers caused by the policy incoherence. We conclude that the transition to climate-friendly peatland usage requires coherent regulatory frameworks and incentive-based policies supporting rewetting.

AB  - Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most biodiversity-rich terrestrial ecosystems, and are managed for conservation purposes in most of Europe, including Sweden. Romania has some of Europe's largest areas of grasslands still managed with traditional methods. Through interviews and field studies, current management practices were investigated in two Romanian villages, and compared with CAP-generated grassland management in Swedish hay meadows and historical Swedish management of grasslands. The study evaluated the effect of the eligibility criteria within both countries' National Rural Development Programmes (NRDPs) on different ecologically important components of hay meadow management. The success of Swedish management was measured by assessing population trends for 25 grassland plant species. Current management proved to be considerably more diverse in Romania than in Sweden, but historical Swedish management was similar to management in Romania. Both countries' NRDPs provide support for some management components, but create barriers against other components. The Romanian NRDP contained more barriers than the Swedish NRDP, yet Swedish management showed little success in preserving grassland plants. NRDPs should nourish the use of local and traditional knowledge in order to preserve biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands. There are major limitations in both countries' NRDPs.

AB  - Current global environmental change calls for comprehensive and complementing approaches for biodiversity conservation. According to recent research, consideration of the diversity of Earth's abiotic features (i.e. geodiversity) could provide new insights and applications into the investigation and management of biodiversity. However, methods to map and quantify geodiversity at local scale have not been developed although this scale is important for conservation planning. Here, we introduce a field methodology for observing plot-scale geodiversity, pilot the method in an Arctic-alpine tundra environment, provide empirical evidence on the plot-scale biodiversity-geodiversity relationship and give guidance for practitioners on the implementation of the method. The field method is based on observation of geofeatures, that is, elements of geology, geomorphology and hydrology, from a given area surrounding a location of species observations. As a result, the method provides novel information on the variation of abiotic nature for biodiversity research and management. The method was piloted in northern Norway and Finland by observing geofeatures from 76 sites at three scales (5, 10 and 25 m radii). To explore the relationship between measures of biodiversity and geodiversity, the occurrence of vascular plant species was recorded from 2 m x 2 m plots at the same sites. According to the results, vascular plant species richness was positively correlated with the richness of geofeatures (R-s = 0.18-0.59). The connection was strongest in habitats characterized by deciduous shrubs. The method has a high potential for observing geofeatures without extensive geological or geomorphological training or field survey experience and could be applied by conservation practitioners. Synthesis and applications. Consideration of geodiversity in understanding, analysing and conserving biodiversity could facilitate environmental management and ensure the long-term sustainability of ecosystem functions. With the developed method, it is possible to cost-efficiently observe the elements of geodiversity that are useful in ecology and biodiversity conservation. Our approach can be adapted in different ecosystems and biodiversity investigations. The method can be adjusted depending on the abiotic conditions, expertise of the observer(s) and the equipment available.

AB  - Questions: Boreal forests along small streams are bryophyte diversity hotspots because they are moist, productive and relatively high pH. Do these factors also explain the large differences in species richness and species composition found among streamside sites? Do the species of species-poor sites represent nested subsets of the species of more species-rich sites? How do the results apply to conservation?
   Location: Forests along small streams in mid-boreal Sweden.
   Methods: Survey of the flora of liverworts and mosses and habitat properties, including calculation of a pH-index based on species indicator values, in 37 sites (1000-m(2) plots). Results: The number of bryophyte species per plot ranged from 34 to 125. Neither soil moisture nor basal area of trees (a proxy for productivity) correlated significantly with species richness and composition, whereas pH-index and cover of boulders did. Species richness and composition were more strongly correlated with pH-index for mosses than for liverworts. The richness and composition of bryophyte species most frequently found on moist ground, stream channel margins and, most unexpected, woody debris were all more strongly associated with the pH-index than with other habitat properties. Although species composition was significantly nested, there was still some turnover of species along the first ordination axis.
   Conclusions: To attain high numbers of species, streamside forests need to have boulders and at least pockets with higher soil and stream-water pH. The number of Red list species was weakly correlated with total species richness and the most species-rich sites contained many species found more in nonforest habitats. Hence, bryophyte conservation in streamside forests should not focus on species-rich sites but on the quality and quantity of substrate available for assemblages of forest species that are strongly disfavoured by forestry.

LA  - English
CP  - 5th World Archaeology Conference
AB  - Many countries in southern and eastern Africa share a similar range of rock art and archaeological sites and a similar philosophy regarding their conservation and the intangible heritage related to them. It is therefore possible, at least theoretically, to apply lessons learned in one country to issues that arise in another. Several programs stimulated by the World Heritage Centre, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Norwegian Agency for Development Co-operation (NORAD), the Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency (SIDA), and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) over the past two decades have begun to build capacity and integrate heritage research practice and conservation at a regional level in southern Africa. This paper discusses the Southern African Rock Art Project (SARAP), which has identified rock art as a shared resource in the region and has played an important role in encouraging participating countries to nominate rock art sites for World Heritage listing and to develop appropriate conservation management plans. To succeed, archaeological conservation programs require close cooperation with local communities, as well as an external stimulus, agreement on appropriate behavior toward the sites or resources, and a governmental infrastructure capable of funding, implementing, and monitoring management plans.

AB  - Recent years have shown a rapid increase in the number of published studies that advocate network analysis (graph theory) to ecologically manage landscapes that suffer from fragmentation and loss of connectivity. This paper studies the reasons, benefits and difficulties of using network analysis to manage landscape fragmentation in the practice of land-use planning. The results are based on interviews with thirteen municipal ecologists and environmental planners in Stockholm, Sweden, who had been introduced to a GIS-tool for network-based connectivity analysis. Our results indicate that fragmentation is not considered enough in municipal planning and demonstrate that none of the interviewed practitioners used systematic methods to assess landscape connectivity. The practitioners anticipate that network-level and patch-level connectivity measures and maps would help them to communicate the meaning and implications of connectivity to other actors in the planning process, and to better assess the importance of certain habitats affected by detailed plans. The main difficulties of implementing network-based connectivity analyses reported by the respondents related to the choice of focal species and the lack of model input in terms of landscape data and dispersal distances. The main strengths were expressed by the practitioners as graphical, quantitative and credible results; the ability to compare planning alternatives and to find critical sites in a more objective manner than today; and to relate local planning and ecology to the regional structure of the landscape. Many respondents stressed the role of fragmentation assessments in the endeavor to overcome current spatial mismatches of ecological and administrative scales. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2010, the Finnish Ministry of the Environment launched a re-evaluation and revision of the 1993 inventory of Nationally Valuable Landscape Areas (NVLAs). While the inventory works for implementation of the National Land Use Guidelines, it also showcases the use of landscapes in Finnish national heritage policy. Based on critical readings of three influential Finnish administrative landscape policy reports, I claim that NVLAs, as tools of heritage policy, are based on the approaches and methodologies that have supported Finland's development into a modern nation state by providing tools for intellectual governance of the national past and territory. Rather than meeting the diversity of landscape conceptions, as defined in the European Landscape Convention, the NVLAs run a risk of being in conflict with citizens and actors that do not share the administrative assumption of landscapes as public containers of national heritage.

AB  - Arctic and northern coastal regions are among the least developed in the world in terms of density of settlements, population and resource exploitation. It is often assumed that these regions will be frontiers of future change, conflict and opportunity due to climate change, new transportation routes, geopolitical tensions and increasing demands for their natural resources. But to what degree do global discourses about future challenges in northern coastal areas align with the perceptions and concerns of people living there? Identifying the mainstream public concepts of change can be essential for developing effective and legitimate policies for coastal regions. We surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Lofoten Vesteralen archipelago in Northern Norway to identify their perceptions of the main conflict issues and drivers of change facing their region. Petroleum exploration, infrastructure development, the fishing industry, and uncertainty about future municipal governance and public services emerged as the key conflict themes. Perceptions of drivers group in positive forces; developments and improvements in transportation, the fishing industry, tourism, new marine industries and cultural heritage protection, as well as negative factors; climate change, aging and declining rural populations, degrading of the cultural landscape due to reduced grazing, and bureaucratic obstacles in the fishing industry. The main attention is on social and economic drivers of change, as well as "doorstep" concerns rather than global discourses. National or global environmental and geopolitical issues are largely absent in the responses. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - POLICY ANALYSIS SIMULATION MODEL
KW  - FOREST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
KW  - SUSTAINABLE YIELD
AB  - This article demonstrates that the opportunity cost (return forgone) of cutting principles imposed by the Swedish forest policy is economically significant. The Swedish Forestry Act of 1979 recommends a management strategy for sustaining high yields of valuable timber referred to here as the Balance Strategy. However, the Forestry Act allows for a range of different forest management strategies. The Act establishes both a minimum cutting volume for a ten-year-period and a maximum final cut area referred to here as the Minimum and Maximum Strategies, respectively. These strategies were compared to a management plan, referred to as the Economic Strategy, for minimizing the opportunity cost for the forest owner. Based on data from a recent forest management plan, a simulation model was used to predict yields and economic returns for a period of one hundred years. The results show that at a 4% interest rate the Economic Strategy produces a gain of approximately 8200 SEK ha-1. The Economic Strategy, however, emphasizes volume and its implementation results in a forest far different from that developed under the Balance Strategy, in which quality timber is also produced. The Economic Strategy may also have less favourable effects on biodiversity, conservation of the natural environment and the recreational value of the forest.

AB  - Our work focuses on the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), one of the most stringent, but also contested certificationschemes for sustainable forestry. Responding to criticisms concerning inconsistency at the national level, FSC-International recentlyincreased the prescriptiveness of its international standards, including the development of biodiversity-related International GenericIndicators (IGIs). We aim to understand recent efforts in Canada, Sweden, and Russia to revise national-level FSC standards in linewith biodiversity-related IGIs. What were the key factors influencing the standard-development process and its outcomes? Werestakeholders satisfied with the negotiations and what was finally achieved? The data were drawn from semi-structured interviews withkey participants, a comparative analysis of biodiversity-related indicators in newly approved FSC standards, and analysis of reportsprepared by national FSC offices. We applied the Institutional Development and Analysis framework within a complex systems approachto identify multiple interconnected factors that shaped standard-development processes and outcomes in each country. Our findingsindicate that despite persistent efforts of FSC-International to harmonize FSC standards across all countries, there are a number ofinterrelated key factors, which influence outcomes at the national level. Four common clusters of endogenous factors were key tostandard-development processes and outcomes in each of these countries: process-related factors, biodiversity-related actions, desiredlevel of control over biodiversity-related outcomes, and adequacy of available knowledge about biodiversity. Forest governance wasthe only common cluster of key exogenous factors in Sweden and Russia, many of which were identified as constraining the emergenceof a consensus-oriented negotiation process. Our findings indicate that efforts to enhance the consistent performance of forestcertification for biodiversity conservation require an improved understanding of negotiation outcomes as the emergent products ofinteractions between multiple exogenous and endogenous factors. This implies a need for a greater focus on process management aspectsduring future negotiations.

AB  - Urban streets are an integral part of the public realm. Streets are commonly planned following normative design prin-ciples focused on the connectivity of road networks and urban morphology. Beyond their function as mobility infras-tructure, streetscapes' aesthetic, social, and cultural qualities also have an important impact on the experience of the overall urban environment and human well-being. This study explores how urban design and planning can facilitate the design, management, and use of streetscapes that consider their role as social infrastructure. A paradigmatic case study of Hornsbergs Strand in the City of Stockholm is performed, incorporating spatial and temporal aspects. The case study area is chosen because it is both an attractive and "overcrowded" public space frequently discussed in the Swedish media. Data sources for the study include reviews of public documents such as Stockholm's city planning strategies, local media reports, a report from a resident workgroup, as well as walk-through observations and semi-structured expert interviews. The results highlight the potential of urban design strategies to develop streetscapes as social infrastructure through both permanent design measures and temporary design interventions. The tendency of the change in people's perception and attitude toward the place over time illustrates that design interventions are a continual process. The implications for pub-lic policy, urban development and investment in social infrastructure employing place strategies and design interventions are discussed.

AB  - The European red click beetle, Elater ferrugineus L., is associated with wood mould in old hollow deciduous trees. As a result of severe habitat fragmentation caused by human disturbance, it is threatened throughout its distribution range. A new pheromone-based survey method, which is very efficient in detecting the species, was used in the present study to relate the occurrence of E. ferrugineus to the density of deciduous trees. The latter data were from a recently completed regional survey in SE Sweden recording >120,000 deciduous trees. The occurrence of E. ferrugineus increased with increasing amount of large hollow and large non-hollow trees in the surrounding landscape. Quercus robur (oak) was found to be the most important substrate for E. ferrugineus, whereas two groups of tree species (Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra, vs. Acer platanoides, Aesculus hippocastanum, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia cordata) were less important but may be a complement to oak in sustaining populations of the beetle. The occurrence of E. ferrugineus was explained by the density of oaks at two different spatial scales, within the circle radii 327 m and 4658 m. In conclusion, priority should be given to oaks in conservation management of E. ferrugineus, and then to the deciduous trees in the genera listed above. Conservation planning at large spatial and temporal scales appears to be essential for long-term persistence of E. ferrugineus. We also show that occurrence models based on strategic sampling might result in pessimistic predictions. This study demonstrates how pheromone-based monitoring make insects excellent tools for sustained feedback to models for landscape conservation management.

AB  - Former industrial areas in Europe are being redeveloped into residential and recreational spaces, often including sustainability initiatives. This study explores how the co-governance and management of a productive urban open space contributes to sustainable transformations, and aims to identify the opportunities and challenges that multi-actor design teams face when co-designing sustainable solutions. To achieve this goal, the landscape design process in Klosteroya urban park in Skien municipality, Norway, a privately owned yet publicly regulated park, is used as a case study in co-governance and analysed using the theoretical combined governance and management model developed. Data were collected through the observations of project meetings, document analysis and semi-structured interviews with the multi-actor design team. The results indicated that the working method, through co-creation, produced opportunities for sustainable urban agriculture, enhanced biodiversity, testbeds and water and resource circularities in the landscape, while ensuring a learning process and users' involvement. Willingness to invest due to the lack of technical knowledge and soil contamination are revealed as key challenges. Conclusions emphasise the significance of co-creative landscape practices for productive urban open spaces and sustainable urban transformations, providing insights for an informed analysis of co-governance cases through the combined governance and management model.

AB  - A White Paper on a new integrated management plan for the Norwegian Sea was launched by the Norwegian government in May 2009. Following international guidelines for ecosystem-based management, the plan provides an overall framework for managing all human activities (mainly oil and gas industry, fishing, and shipping) in the area to ensure the continued production and function of the ecosystem. The plan is based on an assessment of the present and projected future impact of human activities and of the interactions between them, taking into account deficits in current knowledge of ecosystem state and dynamics. Areas of particular value in terms of biodiversity or biological production were identified. In each of these valuable areas, any access for substantial human activity is to be carefully managed. To monitor the overall development of the Norwegian Sea, a set of indicators with associated environmental quality objectives have been selected. The approach used builds upon experience gained from the first integrated Norwegian management plan for a marine area, the Barents Sea-Lofoten region, developed in 2002-2006. Work towards a Norwegian management plan for the North Sea, including Skagerrak, was initiated in 2009. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most of Europe's rivers are highly fragmented by barriers. This study examines legal protection schemes, that specifically aim at preserving the free-flowing character of rivers. Based on national legislation, such schemes are found in seven European countries: Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, France and Spain as well as Norway and Iceland. The study provides an overview of the individual schemes and their respective scope, compares their protection mechanisms and assesses their effectiveness. As Europe's the remaining free-flowing rivers are threatened by hydropower and other development, the need for effective legal protection, comparable to the designation of Wild and Scenic Rivers in the United States, is urgent. Similarly, any ambitious strategy for the restoration of free-flowing rivers should be complemented with a mechanism for their permanent protection once dams and other barriers are removed. The investigated legal protection schemes constitute a starting point for envisioning a more cohesive European network of strictly protected free-flowing rivers.

AB  - Birds were counted in Northern Finnish Lapland in an area situated 200 km north of the Arctic Circle in virgin forests in the 1940-50s, and both in virgin and managed forests in 1982-89.  The area consisted of very large habitat patches:  blocks of virgin and managed forests were separated and covered hundreds of square kilometers.  The most abundant species fluctuated similarly both in virgin and managed forests in the 1980s.  The yearly total density of tropical migrants (insectivores) was negatively correlated with the number of cold days in spring.  Short-distance migrants were probably more affected by weather conditions during migration and wintering area.  Species which increased and those which decreased in Northern Finland due to habitat alteration had no such trends in large virgin forests, either from the 1940-50s to the 1980s or during the 1980s.  The brambling Fringilla montifringilla was the only species having a significant within-habitat trend:  it increased from 1940 to the 1950s but decreased in the 1980s.  The brambling is a forest-habitat generalist, and therefore its trends are not likely to be explained by habitat alterations caused by forestry.
   Year-to-year variations in densities of species seem to reflect stochastic environmental changes, such as in weather conditions and seed crop.  Regional population changes caused by habitat alteration are not reflected in population densities in large virgin forests.  The northern taiga species preferring virgin forests (Tetrao urogallus, Picoides tridactylus, Parus cinctus, Perisoreus infaustus and Pinicola enucleator) have drastically declined in the whole of Northern Finland due to habitat loss caused by forest management.  These decreased species seem to survive in large, virgin forests, and therefore the protection of these old-aged coniferous forests is essential.

AB  - Identification of conservation priorities is a fundamental issue for successful nature conservation. This can be done by looking at population trends of species in different habitats. Boreal zone is the key breeding area for many Eurasian waterbirds. Wetlands of the boreal zone can be roughly classified into two different groups: nutrient-poor oligotrophic and nutrient-rich eutrophic water ecosystems. Earlier work has shown that eutrophic lake-specialist species have declined compared with generalists and species preferring oligotrophic lakes. However, it is not known if species that live in both habitats show habitat-specific population trends. We used monitoring data of breeding waterbirds in Finland from 1986 to 2013 to evaluate habitat-specific population trends in five generalist duck species, which mostly overwinter in the coastal waters of West Europe. Population trend of tufted duck was highly significantly more positive in oligotrophic wetlands compared with populations in eutrophic wetlands, and two other species had similar but weaker effects. In addition, we established bird population state indicators for oligotrophic and eutrophic water ecosystems in Finland. The indicators revealed that the populations in eutrophic wetlands have on average halved since early 1990s. The populations in oligotrophic wetlands have remained stable, except a moderate decline since the late 2000s. Our findings support the idea that the waterbird populations of the eutrophic wetlands are in serious trouble. This is likely due to over-eutrophication of these ecosystems. Conservation and management actions should be urgently taken to halt the loss of biodiversity in these globally threatened freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - For a quarter of a century, sustainable development has been on the political and research agendas. Within the field of landscape ecology, a wide array of research has documented the effects of alternative land uses, analysed driving forces of land use change and developed tools for measuring such changes, to mention but a few developments. There have also been great advances in technology and data management. Nevertheless, unsustainable land use continues to occur and the science of landscape ecology has had less influence on landscape change than aimed for. In this paper we use Norwegian examples to discuss some of the reasons for this. We examine mismatches in the spatial and temporal scales considered by scientists, decision-makers and those who carry out land use change, consider how this and other factors hinder effective communication between scientists and practitioners, and urge for a stronger focus on what it is that motivates people to action. We suggest that the concept of landscape services can be useful not only for researchers but also provide valuable communication and planning tools. Finally, we suggest more emphasis on applying adaptive management in landscape ecology to help close the gaps, both between researchers and policy and, even more crucially, between researchers and practitioners.

AB  - With a changing climate, storm and wind throw is becoming an increasing risk to forest. However, Swedish forest management practices have so far involved relatively little consideration of adaptation to climate change. This study examined resistance and alternatives to business as usual forest management, drawing upon material obtained in interviews with individual forest owners who spontaneously identified and discussed storm and wind throw as a risk to their forest. They thereby expressed a logic differing from that of the forest industry in Sweden, which has largely normalised storm risk rather than considering it in climate change adaptation work. The present analysis illustrates the broad and largely concerned position of individual forest owners, in contrast with a more established industry position on storm as an accepted and existing risk. Overall, the study highlights the diversity, agency and power relations within Swedish forestry and the forested landscape - aspects that are vital to better understanding processes relevant to forest and climate change adaptation.

AB  - This paper examines the sustainability of urban housing in the European Union. It outlines a number of key criteria for assessing the sustainability of urban housing including mixed-use developments, higher residential densities, high-quality dwellings and neighbourhoods, affordability and food production. Utilizing the 2007 tranche of the European Quality of Life Survey, it finds significant variations between countries in the sustainability of urban housing and communities and highlights the leaders and laggards in this regard. The relative success of urban areas in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland deserves some additional research, although there is scope for considerable improvement even in these "leader" countries. The paper highlights significant problems with housing and communities in some urban locations which must significantly retract from (a) the quality of life of residents in these locations and (b) the sustainability of their cities.

AB  - Increasing numbers of horses are being kept for sports and leisure purposes in pen-urban areas throughout the Western world. This expansion of the equestrian sector represents a multifunctional transition, with new production of rural goods and services and increasing influence on land use.
   In Sweden, the number of horses has increased from 70,000 to approximately 300,000 over the last 30 years. This increase is putting pressure on the traditional Right of Public Access, an old custom allowing the public to walk, cycle or ride on private or state-owned property.
   This paper analyses multifunctional land use in pen-urban areas in order to provide a deeper understanding of the potential conflicts arising due to the expanding equine sector and to assess how these can affect the Swedish right of public access and spatial planning.
   A survey of horse riders and landowners in three pen-urban regions of Sweden revealed that these groups differ in their attitudes towards the Right of Public Access. The data also showed that the expanding equine sector is generating new demands on rural areas and there are questions regarding how the current system of open accessibility can meet the increasing market for equestrian leisure activities. The main conclusion is that there seems to be a strong need for intervention and deliberate creation of new ways of handling the accessibility question, where both a bottom-up and top-down approach may be useful.

AB  - The different approaches that other countries take to land use reflect many national variables, including planning systems, institutional structures, socio-cultural characteristics. population pressures and environmental priorities. Literature reviews of relevant land-use issues in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden provided the background material for this paper. Other European countries appear to offer models of more pro-active and indicative land-use planning, in contrast to the adversarial system in the UK, and a much stronger regional focus. This seems to have made it easier to implement other policies, for example on renewable energy. Experience with liberalisation of agricultural markets, and the promotion of environmentally Sustainable farming are both relevant to an increasingly polarised agricultural sector in the UK. Cutting across all these themes is a reflection on governance of land use. Of the countries considered, Sweden's focus on environmental sustainability, international responsibility and long-term consistency of direction appears to be most closely aligned to the coming land-use challenges. When drawing conclusions from this review it is important to bear in mind the effect of differences in bio-geographic factors, socio-economic conditions and political Culture, both in other countries and within the UK.

AB  - Norway is the largest hydropower producer in Europe and provides currently 96% of domestic electricity supplies. Hydropower is a renewable and climate friendly source of energy, but causes an impairment on local environmental conditions, recreational use and aesthetics in and along impacted watercourses and lakes. Around 70% of the larger Norwegian watercourses and half of the country`s total water-covered areas are regulated for hydropower production. By 2022, up to 430 hydropower licences will come up for revisions to implement the European Water Framework Directive in Norway. These have considerable potential to increase environmental and aesthetic conditions in Norwegian watercourses. We examine the decision-making of five completed licence revisions by means of document analyses of all relevant written sources, showing the content, methods and procedural qualities of the revision process. Despite case-specific differences, there are significant commonalities which form the basis for recommendations. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to improve the documentation of physical impacts and value judgements in hydropower decision-making processes. We analyse the perception of main interest groups with regards to the use of MCDA in future revisions. There exists a rather strong resistance to using MCDA due to a variety of political and regulatory reasons.

AB  - Forest use in Sweden may be seen as constituting an essentially conflicted area, in which a number of actors position themselves. Based on a review of policy documents, this study reviews discourses on forest amongst major organisational actors between 2001 and 2011, with the aim of discussing the ways in which discourse may have changed following increasing criticism of the previously dominating production paradigm during the period. The study also discusses the ways in which forest discourses at present may also exclude areas that are relevant to forest planning. Results illustrates the continuous role of, on the one hand, production and private ownership discourses among the forest industry, and, on the other, conservation and public access discourses, among environmental and other NGOs. Large differences thus continue to exist despite the double aim towards production and protection in Swedish forest law. Areas that are not directly related to this nexus although related to land use at large, such as municipal planning, on the other hand, are largely absent from discourse even if, for instance, shore planning and wind power issues that are related to municipal planning are taken up.

AB  - Marine macro algae may play a significant role in the transformation to the future post fossil fuel and low carbon society. Previous research shows that high expectations for future and large-scale algae cultivation in European waters are often followed by identification of a wide range of challenges linked to the same development. This paper specifically investigates the locational challenges for algae cultivation in spatial planning at the local level along the Norwegian coast. Based on statistics from Norwegian Fisheries Directorate and a survey to Norwegian spatial managers, we explore in detail the challenges for communities, when prioritizing and allocating areas for industrial production of algae. The data suggest some areas for concern that a future upscaling effort would likely need to address. First, the possible encroachment on already established aquaculture should not be underestimated. Uncertainty related to the suitability of areas for algae production combined with a generally more area demanding activity contributes to this. Second, this uncertainty also points to a general knowledge gap on the part of local planners. Finally, the data also suggest other areas for concern that a future upscaling effort would likely need to address, namely that an upscaling of algae production needs to be sensitive to local contexts. The data suggest that a lack of expertise on aquaculture is linked to both lower industry satisfaction, higher levels of conflict, less experience with aquaculture in general, and smaller municipalities.

AB  - Research Highlights: We show the difference in the long-term effects on economic and ecological forest values between four forest management scenarios of a large representative forest landscape. The scenarios were largely formulated by stakeholders representing the main views on how to manage north-European forests. Background and Objectives: Views on how to balance forest management between wood production and biodiversity differ widely between different stakeholder groups. We aim to show the long-term consequences of stakeholder-defined management scenarios, in terms of ecological and economic forest values. Materials and Methods: We simulated management scenarios for a forest landscape in Sweden, based on the management objectives and strategies of key stakeholders. We specifically investigated the difference in economic forest values coupled to wood supply and ecological indicators coupled to structural biodiversity between the scenarios over a 100-year period. The indicators were net present value, harvest, growing stock and increment, along with deadwood volume, the density of large trees, area of old forests and mature broadleaf-rich forests. Results: We show that the scenarios have widely different outcomes in terms of the studied indicators, and that differences in indicator outcome were largely due to different distributions in management regimes, i.e., the proportion of forest left unmanaged or under even-aged management or continuous cover forest, as well as specific retention practices. Retention and continuous cover forestry mitigate the negative effects that clear-cut forestry has upon biodiversity. Conclusions: We found that an increase in the forest area under the continuous cover forestry regime could be a cost-efficient way to increase structural diversity in managed boreal forests. On the other hand, no single management regime performed best with respect to all indicators, which means that a mixture of several management regimes is needed to balance conflicting objectives. We also show that the trade-off between economic and ecological indicators was not directly proportional, meaning that an increase in structural biodiversity may be obtained at a proportionally low cost with appropriate management planning.

AB  - Conservation assessments of lichens have usually been based on scattered and methodologically diverse data. We illustrate the contribution of standardized inventories to conventional data sources by assessing the status of two conspicuous epixylic Cladonia species of conservation concern in Estonia. A time-limited inventory of all lichen species was carried out in 92 stands (2 ha each) in a balanced design of forests and clear-cuts. Cladonia parasitica (previously considered Regionally Extinct) was present in 13 stands with a total of 33 individual records, almost exclusively in dry boreal old-growth forests and clear-cuts. Thirty-six records of C. norvegica (previously six records) were made in 17 stands, most frequently in mature meso-eutrophic forests. On average, 1.5 hours of inventory were needed to discover C. parasitica in a stand, and 2 hours for C. norvegica. The scarcity of old records was probably due to the low local abundance of the species, their habitats being unpopular among lichenologists and expenditure of too short an inventory time in the field. Using habitat and frequency data, we estimate that the national Population sizes of the species clearly exceed those set as IUCN criteria for species at risk. The key issue is the expected trend in substratum abundance, which suggests C. parasitica to be Near Threatened. We recommend stratified random sampling as an efficient method to collect quantitative information for lichen flora assessments.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat modification and fragmentation is considered one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. To develop effective conservation strategies towards such pressures we need to improve our understanding of how species richness and community composition are shaped by species' responses to landscape patterns. In this study we tested relationships between patch size and isolation, species richness and species traits in a fragmented landscape of calcareous grasslands-a diversity hotspot in Southern Norway. We recorded a total of 381 vascular plant species, of which 50 are considered habitat specialists, distributed among 86 habitat patches (50-9,475 m(2)) in 22 of 50 randomly sampled 500 x 500 m-plots. We found that large habitat patches held more species of both generalists and specialists than small habitat patches and that well-connected patches held more specialist species than isolated patches. About 1/3 of the habitat specialists in this study system showed vulnerability to isolation, i.e. lower probability of occurrence in isolated patches. Traits related both to persistence (short lifespan) and colonization ability (low seed production per plant) were predictors of vulnerability to isolation. Our results indicate that both colonization and extinction processes affect species composition and richness, and that the rescue-effect-mitigation of local, area-dependent extinctions through colonization-is reduced in isolated patches. These findings suggest that conservation strategies should place greater emphasis on the spatial configuration of the habitat network, and on the preservation of colonization processes to ensure regional persistence of species.

AB  - Climate change poses a serious challenge to sustainable urban development worldwide. In Sweden, climate change work at the city level emerged in 1996 and has long had a focus on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. City planners' "adaptation turn" is recent and still ongoing. This paper presents a meta-evaluation of Swedish municipal adaptation approaches, and how they relate to institutional structures at different levels. The results show that although increasing efforts are being put into the identification of barriers to adaptation planning, in contrast, there is little assessment or systematization of the actual adaptation measures and mainstreaming strategies taken. On this basis, opportunities for advancing a more comprehensive approach to sustainable adaptation planning at both the local and institutional level are discussed.

AB  - Ash generated by the combustion of solid biofuels is increasingly being returned to the fuel's place of origin (mostly forests). In this way, nutrient depletion and acidification caused by biofuel harvest is counteracted and a waste problem is solved. Concerns about the potential negative effects of ash spreading on forest biodiversity (in particular mosses) have been raised, but little is known. I studied the effects of the application of two types of ash (the most used self-hardened crushed ash including fine particles and a less reactive type, pellets without fine particles) on 28 moss species and 17 liverwort species. In two field experiments, one on transplants of ground-living species and one on wood-inhabiting species in situ, I measured the response during the first two months after ash application. Visible damage (discoloration from green to brown) was assessed for all species and the growth response was measured for 24 ground-living species. The responses to crushed ash were clearly related to the species' pH ecology and phylogenetic position. The growth of bryophytes associated with acidic conditions (pooled data from 10 species) or considered as being indifferent to pH (4 species) was negatively affected, whereas there was no effect on the growth of bryophytes of non-acidic habitats (10 species). The connection to phylogeny was even clearer. Most taxa responded negatively, but transplants from the moss order Bryales (4 species) and the family Brachytheciaceae (2 species; order Hypnales) grew better when treated with ash. The genera with the clearest negative responses were Sphagnum mosses (5 species), Tetraphis mosses (1 species), Dicranum mosses (6 species), and Barbilophozia liverworts (2 species). The four red-listed wood-inhabiting liverworts studied were not significantly damaged. Concerning ash type, pellets caused smaller effects than crushed ash, both on the positive and negative side. The results show that responses to ash recycling of the bryophyte species included in this study are predictable from their phylogenetic position and/or pH ecology. Further studies are needed to determine the generality of these results and to sort out if phylogeny or current relationship to pH is the primary determinant of the response. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Sustainable land use in post-mining areas has received more attention only recently. This study examined landscape characteristics and post-mining land use in 51 metal mining sites in Finland. Studied mines were closed during the period of 1924-2016, and over half of them had been active more than 10 years. Mines were typically located in sparsely populated forest landscapes. Cultural and recreational functions were found in one third of the sites, especially in significant historical mining areas close to the population centers. Further, nearly one third of the post-mining sites included new activities related to industry and infrastructure. The diversity of post-mining functions was generally limited in small and isolated sites. Re-opening of five closed mines was planned or under development, and exploration permits (or claims) were applied or admitted for half of the post-mining areas. The results showed that every closed mine is unique and thus, sustainable post-mining land use requires careful evaluation of potentials and limitations (e.g., contamination and other hazards) of the sites. Increasing sizes of new mining projects calls for paying more attention on future post-mining landscapes in order to avoid degraded and underused areas from environmental, social and economic perspectives.

AB  - Forest fragmentation increases the amount of edges in the landscape. Differences in wind, radiation, and vegetation structure create edge-to-interior gradients in forest microclimate, and these gradients are likely to be more pronounced during droughts and heatwaves. Although the effects of climate extremes on edge influences have potentially strong and long-lasting impacts on forest understory biodiversity, they are not well understood and are not often considered in management and landscape planning. Here we used a novel method of retrospectively quantifying growth to assess biologically relevant edge influences likely caused by microclimate using Hylocomium splendens, a moss with annual segments. We examined how spatio-temporal variation in drought across 3 years and 46 sites in central Sweden, affected the depth and magnitude of edge influences. We also investigated whether edge effects during drought were influenced by differences in forest structure. Edge effects were almost twice as strong in the drought year compared to the non-drought years, but we did not find clear evidence that they penetrated deeper into the forest in the drought year. Edge influences were also greater in areas that had fewer days with rain during the drought year. Higher levels of forest canopy cover and tree height buffered the magnitude of edge influence in times of drought. Our results demonstrate that edge effects are amplified by drought, suggesting that fragmentation effects are aggravated when droughts become more frequent and severe. Our results suggest that dense edges and buffer zones with high canopy cover can be important ways to mitigate negative drought impacts in forest edges.

AB  - The state of sea trout in 1251 Norwegian watercourses was assessed based on a scoring system for human pressures, abundance data, and local knowledge.Over 16,000 km of rivers and lakes were available to sea trout in these watercourses, spanning from the temperate to Arctic regions.Sea trout were classified to be in a good or very good state in fewer than 25% of the watercourses and in a poor or very poor state in almost 40%. Twenty-nine watercourses had lost their sea trout populations. Salmon lice from aquaculture salmon farms had by far the largest adverse effect on sea trout among the human impact factors, both in the number of watercourses (83%) and river area affected (60%), and the total effect on sea trout abundance. Agriculture and hydropower production also had strong adverse impacts (35% and 19% of watercourses), but substantially lower than that caused by salmon lice. Culverts related to road crossings and other habitat alterations also had impacts on sea trout in many watercourses (27%). Exploitation of sea trout has been reduced in Norway in recent years, both in the marine and freshwater fisheries. Yet, the exploitation pressure was moderate or high in almost 14% of the watercourses where the state of sea trout was poor or very poor, suggesting a high potential for overexploitation in these.The state of sea trout was best in the northern sparsely populated areas. However, distribution of watercourses with sea trout in a poor or very poor state was more linked to aquaculture, agriculture, and hydropower production than human population density.The developed approach for large-scale mapping of state and pressures, which is vital for prioritizing management measures, may inspire other nations in their conservation effort for this important species.

AB  - Eutrophication problems in the Baltic Sea have drawn attention to the contribution of nutrients from surrounding countries. By using the HBV-N model in southern Sweden (145 000 km(2)) daily nitrogen leaching, reduction in rivers and lakes, net transport to the sea and source apportionment have been calculated in 3725 subbasins for the period 1985-1994, with calibration at 722 sites against measured time series. On average, 48% of the nonpoint losses from agriculture were reduced during the transport towards the sea, which left about 33 500 tonnes in annual mean net transport. This represents 45% of the total land-based load. Land cover and emissions for the years of 1985 and 1994 were used in two separate simulations of the 10-year period. The normalized gross leakage from arable land in 1985 was estimated to 29 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), which corresponds to 15 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in net leakage to the sea. In 1994 these transports were reduced by 20 and 15%, and thereby the total load on the sea was decreased by 7%. This is still far from the Swedish goal of 50% reduction. The article presents the spatial variation of nitrogen leakage and retention within the southern half of Sweden, and emphasizes the importance of allocating measures where down-stream retention is low in order to achieve efficiency with respect to the sea. It is shown that the model approach may be used in the decision making process for best management practices in watersheds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper studies adaptive water governance in the context of hydropower and flood-risk management. The Kemi River basin acts as an empirical setting to study the environmental change and the capacity of the management system to respond to it. Hydropower and reservoir development has been a source of a decade-long environmental conflict in the river basin. This study aims to find out how governance structures are adapting to the environmental change brought on by climate change. The study is based on case study research, and it combines long-term monitoring data, semi-structured interviews conducted in December 2020 and January 2021, and Finnish administrative court rulings. The results reveal that the water governance in the Kemi River basin is based on a technology driven aquatic regime, which has been a source of persistent environmental conflict between technology and nature. The flood-risk management is based on adaptive planning cycles and is implemented in a participatory manner, although it is strengthening the conflict in the area, as some stakeholders suggests reservoirs as a solution, which neglects the potential of integrative river basin management.

AB  - Large carnivores are often used as focal species (indicators, umbrellas, flagships or keystones) in conservation strategies either aimed at conserving carnivores, the rest of the biodiversity that occupies their habitats, or both. We evaluate their suitability for these roles in the context of boreal forest biodiversity conservation in the muti-use landscapes of Scandinavia. The enormous conflicts, especially with livestock, that carnivores cause in these areas makes them very controversial flagships to the extent that it may affect rural people's attitudes to conservation in general. Because of the broad habitat tolerance of large carnivores and their prey, and the difficulties in surveying carnivore numbers, they are very insensitive and impractical indicators of forest biodiversity. This ability of large carnivores to thrive in industrial forests means that the many species that are sensitive to modern forestry will not fall under the umbrella of areas managed for large carnivores. If large carnivores have a keystone function with respect to affecting the density of their ungulate prey it is likely to lead to even further conflicts with hunters who gain economic benefit from harvesting wild ungulates. In other words, none of the classic 'ecological' arguments are likely to help justify large carnivore conservation, and large carnivore conservation is unlikely to help conserve the rest of the boreal forest's biodiversity. Based on these arguments we recommend that (1) justification for large carnivore conservation focus on the real philosophical and value orientated reasons rather than ecological justifications, (2) that this conservation should be brought about in practice by dedicated management programs that specifically address the conflicts caused by large carnivores, and (3) that boreal forest biodiversity is best conserved by specific actions designed to establish reserves or change forestry practices.

AB  - This interdisciplinary study examined how perceived legitimacy and empowerment as well as expectations concerning positive outcomes in forest conservation explained forest owners' willingness to cooperate with environmental officials in the context of voluntary nature conservation. The views of 965 forest owners in southern Finland, where national forest conservation policy has been recently discussed and renewed, were analysed by structural equation modelling of questionnaire responses. Based on the models, perceived legitimacy and empowerment predicted forest owners' willingness to cooperate with environmental officials in nature conservation via the expectation that nature conservation would lead to positive outcomes. In addition, a significant interaction between legitimacy and empowerment was found: forest owners' empowerment perceptions increased the willingness to cooperate only among those owners who perceived the legitimacy of nature conservation to be low. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for research on legitimacy and empowerment as well as the application of nature conservation policies.

AB  - The use of quantitative analysis and related metrics has traditionally been unusual for assessment of ecological impacts in urban planning. Since 2010, however, quantitative modelling has been increasingly used in such contexts in Sweden to analyze ecological connectivity. The study reviews and analyses 21 connectivity analysis reports (CAR) based on 17 criteria. Despite the use of quantitative analysis, CARs primarily leverage qualitative aspects of modelling results. Most CARs comply with about 50% of the proposed criteria and close to 90% of the reports fail to address some issues related to modelling transparency and therefore jeopardize an adequate ecological interpretation of the results. The results demonstrate that the primary accomplishment during the last decade is an increase in awareness and acceptance of ecological connectivity among practitioners and decisionmakers. Results point to that an increased use of quantitative methods per se will not deliver more sustainable outcomes, and that an increased use of quantitative methods for ecological impact assessment in urban planning needs to be accompanied by guidelines, standards, and a continuous science - practice knowledge exchange.

AB  - This article describes the transformation of old-growth forest to managed forests, in North (N) Sweden and boreal regions of North-West (BNW) Russia, from economic, social and ecological perspectives. Whereas in BNW Russia, the logging frontier could be kept moving into unharvested regions, N Sweden earlier had to develop solutions where large-scale logging had already taken place. In 1950-1990, Swedish strategies included rationing of old forest, effective regeneration and also precommercial and commercial thinning. Supporting means were legislation, government-funded subsidies and collaboration among enterprises, researchers and political leaders. BNW Russia is currently facing similar challenges and N Swedish experiences should be analysed and used where applicable. In N Sweden, a too low proportion of representative productive old forests remains, but in the last decades, N Swedish forests exempted from economic use have been significantly increased. Ongoing discussions of also defining areas with more intensive forest management would lead to a zoning, bearing some resemblance to the Russian system, in use since 1943. Russian experience should, therefore, be of interest to Swedish forest policy-makers. Both countries have problems with rural social issues. Both can benefit from collaboration on these aspects of sustainable forest management.

AB  - Several international regimes provide numerous recommendations for sustainable forest management and there is a growing interest in knowing more about the potential and actual effects of such regimes and improving their effectiveness. National implementation of such regimes go through different stages of development, from changes 'on paper' in regulations and guidelines (labelled output), to behavioural changes among target groups (labelled outcome) before responses are seen on the natural environment (labelled impacts). The main purpose of this paper is to apply a quantitative bio-economic model for analysing the potential impacts on Norwegian forestry of two international regimes (the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and an extended version of the Kyoto Protocol), and to discuss the weak and strong points in using this kind of method in policy analysis. Our findings imply that: (i) The CBD regime has rather limited impacts on the forest structure and harvest as long as it is practised with an intensity corresponding to the forest certification schemes used at present in Norway, or with lower intensity. (ii) Practiced with maximum consideration to biodiversity the potential impact of the CBD regime on the forest structure and harvest is strong, and it can reduce the income from timber production by 30% or more compared to present forestry practices. This reduction is highest when forest climate mitigation is given low consideration. (iii) There is a significant mutual relationship between the two regimes analysed, in the meaning that the weaker one of them is implemented, the stronger marginal impact has the other. (iv) Using quantitative bio-economic modelling in policy impact analyses like this contributes to the methodological literature on regime effectiveness, and has several advantages. But due considerations should be given to underlying basic assumptions related to agent behaviour and the ecosystem detail level required.

AB  - QuestionsDoes restoration success of formerly abandoned semi-natural pastures depend on adjacent land use? Is species richness higher in restored pastures adjacent to an intact semi-natural pasture than in restored pastures adjacent to arable land? Does community similarity between a restored and an adjacent intact pasture decrease with distance from the border between the two pastures? Do differences in species richness and community similarity decrease over time?
   LocationAgricultural landscapes in south-central Sweden.
   MethodsThe plant community in previously abandoned but now restored semi-natural pastures was surveyed along a distance gradient from the border between the restored pastures and adjacent fields towards the centre of the pastures. The restored pastures were located adjacent to either a crop field (N=8) or a continuously grazed pasture (N=6), and differed in time since restoration (1-13yr).
   ResultsThe total species richness was higher in pastures adjoining continuously grazed pastures compared to crop fields. Richness of both total and specialist species increased with time since restoration. Irrespective of adjacent land use, richness of specialist species decreased with increasing distance from the edge, an effect that became weaker with increasing time since restoration. The similarity in species composition compared to that in adjacent continuously grazed pasture also decreased towards the centre of the restored pasture.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that restoration of biodiversity in semi-natural pastures benefits from adjacent pastures that can act as source habitats. The most likely mechanism is step-wise short-distance dispersal, but also other processes, such as more long-distance dispersal, seed bank dynamics and historical legacies are probably involved. To best succeed in habitat restoration in fragmented landscapes, the spatial location of source populations must be considered.

AB  - The paper applies a non-linear optimization approach to evaluate biodiversity in the multipurpose modelling of forest management. An even-aged forest of pure Norway spruce was generated from large-scale inventory data of the Black Forest of southwest Germany. The effects of different management alternatives including five conversion schemes, two traditional age-class and single-tree-selection systems and a "Do-nothing" strategy were simulated using the forest growth model "BWINPro-S". Optimal allocation of management strategies to the forest area was found subject to the hard constraints of "area" and "protection" and the chance constraint "wood even flow". A utility function representing the value of biodiversity was estimated based on the opportunity costs of different biodiversity levels. The upper and lower boundaries of the function were determined by successive optimization runs. Subsequently, the obtained monetary value of biodiversity was directly integrated into the optimization of a particular forest to identify the optimal allocation of management schemes to entire forest enterprise. Conservation or "Do-Nothing" was the most desirable scenario combined with the partial establishment of beech regeneration. Economic and silvicultural consequences of the optimal multi-purpose forest management plan were discussed and compared to the alternative business-as-usual strategies.

AB  - (1) Background: Although Norwegian aquaculture has experienced tremendous development, environmental challenges limit opportunities for growth. To promote environmentally sustainable industry growth, a new spatial management regime was introduced: the Traffic Light System (TLS). However, with a focus on environmental sustainability and economic growth, the new regime largely ignores important factors for industry development: legitimacy and acceptance. (2) Methods: This study used qualitative methods such as interviews and document analysis. (3) Results: The results showed how aquaculture stakeholders perceive and weigh the dimensions of sustainability. Low social sustainability, owing to low content legitimacy and acceptance, places stakeholders in an interest tug o' war. (4) Conclusions: Legitimacy and acceptance are prerequisites for industry growth, which may ultimately affect the objective of sustainable growth. In particular, a lack of legitimacy and acceptance may affect procedural legitimacy and thus the long-standing institutional setup in Norway.

AB  - Many goose species feed on agricultural land, and with growing goose numbers, conflicts with agriculture are increasing. One possible solution is to designate refuge areas where farmers are paid to leave geese undisturbed. Here, we present a generic modelling tool that can be used to designate the best locations for refuges and to gauge the area needed to accommodate the geese. With a species distribution model, locations are ranked according to goose suitability. The size of the area to be designated as refuge can be chosen by including more or less suitable locations. A resource depletion model is then used to estimate whether enough resources are available within the designated refuge to accommodate all geese, taking into account the dynamics of food resources, including depletion by geese. We illustrate this with the management scheme for pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus implemented in Norway. Here, all geese can be accommodated, but damage levels appear to depend on weather, land use and refuge size.

AB  - Goals concerning reduced car traffic are found in most European cities, indicating a potential change in local transport policy and land use planning, which have traditionally been very car-centric. This paper analyses goals and measures to reduce car traffic in Swedish municipalities' long-term transport and land use plans. Theoretically, the paper is based on an understanding of policies as parts of 'problem representations' that create particular ways of understanding car traffic as a policy problem, which in turn influence the measures seen as appropriate or inappropriate. The results indicate that changes are underway. At the heart of these changes are narratives about city development in which municipalities understand the 'attractive city' as one where cars are defined as a problem to be addressed. However, the dominant policy problematisation produce several 'blind spots'. Regional car trips, including travel to out-of-town shopping areas, are left unproblematised in this representation of the problem, meaning that measures addressing such trips are ignored in policy making. The paper builds our understanding of how policy practices influence the potential for change towards sustainability by discussing whether municipalities are doing enough to address the big problems with cars.

AB  - This paper reviews an ongoing, large-scale multidisciplinary experiment designed to study the possibilities of rehabilitating forest structure and species composition through logging, dead wood creation and fire in managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southern Finland. These forests have been utilized for several centuries with intensive management and clear-cut harvesting, which has been the dominant practice in Finland since World War II. During this era, the forest structure has become relatively even-aged, and the amount of dead wood has been reduced considerably. Simultaneously, due to an effective fire suppression policy, the role of fire in Finnish nature has been almost completely eliminated. One of the key species in biodiversity, aspen (Populus tremula), has also been actively removed from the forests in the past. Forest restoration activities, such as the creation of dead wood and the reintroduction of fire to forest management, have been suggested in conservation and restoration programmes. So far we have studied the immediate effects of restorative actions on forest structure, regeneration, soil nutrient status, understorey and epixylic vegetation, lichens and beetles. In the larger Evo research area we have also studied the population structure of aspen in both protected and managed forests. Our early results show that it is possible, through active forest restoration, i.e. the creation of dead wood and prescribed burning, to rehabilitate boreal forest diversity, even when a significant part of the wood volume is harvested for commercial use. Despite the fact that the immediate effects of fire on many species groups were negative, the long-term effects are expected to be predominantly positive. There is currently a decline in aspen populations in Finnish forests. The absence of large aspens in managed forests and the absence of younger trees/cohorts in conservation areas, combined with high mortality, is a significant threat to aspen-dwelling species. We conclude that studies on active restoration treatments, together with long-term inventories of several species groups, are necessary in order to assess the impacts of varying restoration practices for cost-efficient large-scale applications.

AB  - The timely implementation of climate adaptation measures for the urban environment is essential to the creation of robust cities. Within Norway, these adaptation measures are undertaken at the municipal level. Unfortunately, the implementation of adaptation measures has lagged behind expectations, partially due to public resistance to local projects. City planners seek tools to provide insight into the priorities of residents to build consensus and public support. This study follows up on two previous case studies of Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS) implementation in Trondheim, Norway, where the prioritization of urban space is often a source of conflict. The Hofstede Cultural Compass is a tool that maps six cultural dimensions used in research and practice to inform users about cultural norms and cross-cultural divergences. This study seeks to test and verify this tool for use in building public consensus and support. Municipal managers responsible for project implementation took the Cultural Compass survey, and the results were collectively mapped and compared to the public at large. The Cultural Compass found notable divergences between the municipality and the Norwegian public within the areas of "Long-term Orientation", "Uncertainty Avoidance", and "Masculinity vs. Femininity". These findings were cross-referenced with thematically analyzed interviews of residents regarding their perceptions of a municipal SUDS project. Together, these case studies give greater insight into the issues of diverging priorities and perspectives experienced in the implementation of SUDS. Recommendations are presented to aid the understanding of intercultural divergences between planning offices and public priorities in an effort to better engage the public and build consensus.

AB  - There is a long tradition of sustainable forest policy in Finland. Today, forests should be managed on the basis of the principles of sustainable forestry. However, economics have driven such forestry practices, resulting in dramatic changes to the natural structure and dynamics of Finnish forests. Commercial forests should, however, also provide habitats for various organisms, and forestry activities should not reduce forest biodiversity. Indicators can provide useful information on the ecological status and trends in sustainable forestry, such information can then be used by decision-makers. In attempts to develop accurate and reliable indicators, it has been suggested that statistical data, inventory data and data on many taxa may prove useful. The richness of game species and the abundance of the Siberian flying squirrel have been considered as candidate indicators for sustainable forestry. Indicators of sustainable forestry are commonly used separately and the interrelations between the ecological, economic and social dimensions of forestry have rarely been studied. In this paper we examine associations between the abundance of animal species (16 game species and Siberian flying squirrels) and their co-occurrence with forest structural characteristics that are considered to be indicators of sustainable forestry. We were also interested in examining regional patterns of the variables, and determining which socioeconomic indicators and land-use factors were associated (positively or negatively) with areas of forest for which there were indicators suggesting a good ecological condition. The study area consisted of 39 observation units. Based on our exploratory and descriptive analyses we suggest that using indices for different wildlife species groups and relative abundances of the Siberian flying squirrel together with forest structural characteristics and adequate socio-cultural variables could provide relevant information about trends in sustainable forestry. The application of indicators always depends on socio-cultural contexts and biogeographical factors, and these must be taken into consideration when making predictions or comparing different regions.

AB  - Context Land-use change can reduce and isolate suitable habitat generating spatial variation in resource availability. Improving species distribution models requires a multi-scale understanding of resource requirements and species' sensitivities to novel landscapes.
   Objectives We investigated how the spatial distribution of supplementary habitats (permanent wetlands), urbanization, water depths, and distribution of a key prey species (muskrat; Ondatra zibethicus) influence occupancy dynamics of American mink (Neovison vison). Although mink are widespread across North America and a destructive invasive species in Europe, South America, and Asia, we have a limited understanding of factors affecting their spatial distribution.
   Methods We used 6 years of presence-absence data (2007-2012) to evaluate occupancy dynamics of mink at 58-90 stream sites along an urbanization gradient in Illinois, USA. We predicted negative relationships between stream occupancy and urban land cover and distance from permanent wetlands, and positive associations with muskrat presence, water depth, and riparian zone width.
   Results Contrary to our hypothesis, stream sites closer to permanent wetlands had lower occupancy and colonization rates for mink. Occupancy and colonization rates were higher at sites with deeper water, and colonization rates were related negatively to urbanization. Mink were more likely to leave stream habitat if muskrats were not present and permanent wetlands were nearby.
   Conclusion Factors interplaying across multiple scales influenced occupancy dynamics of mink in stream habitat in a highly modified landscape. Our results highlight the importance of considering both direct measures of prey availability and the spatial distribution of supplementary habitats to improve habitat-selection models for carnivores.

AB  - The effectiveness of protected areas to conserve biodiversity depends on conservation management strategies and their application, usually to specific protected areas. This paper presents the results of an assessment of the conservation management strategy for a protected mountain area dominated by Norway spruce forests. The study was based on the prediction of future forest ecosystem development using a SYBILA growth simulation model. This model predicts the changes of forest stand over 25 and 50 years in the context of the conservation management strategy that is part of the broader management plan. The article presents a case study of acidophilous spruce forests below the alpine tree line in the Hruby Jesenik Mountains (Czech Republic), where the forest ecosystems are protected under the Natura 2000 European network and the Czech national system of protected areas. Conserving the character of forest habitats, especially those that are historically affected by humans, is the main target of conservation management strategies. Synthesizing the growth simulation results allows an assessment of the conservation management strategy in achieving management targets. The paper highlights the importance of growth simulation models as support tools for the assessment and creation of adaptive conservation management strategies in mountain protected areas.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation often requires a landscape perspective. When establishing the Natura 2000 (N2k) network, the effectiveness of the sites and the influence of the surrounding landscapes for species of interest was often disregarded. We analyzed the effectiveness of N2k sites in Sweden for three forest bird species of conservation interest in the European boreal landscapes: lesser spotted woodpecker (LSW), Siberian jay (SJ) and hazel grouse (HG). Our objectives were to: 1) quantify effective suitable habitat area in N2k sites with and without consideration of the adjoining landscapes; 2) examine effective habitat area within N2k sites along the north-south vegetation gradient 3) analyze functionality of N2k sites and assess how forests outside the sites affect habitat suitability inside N2k. GISbased habitat suitability index models were applied to calculate the amount of effective habitat within and outside N2k sites. N2k sites contributed with 10% (HG), 13% (SJ) and 51% (LSW) suitable habitat identified in Sweden. Functionality of forest environments as habitat was higher inside N2k sites for LSW within all vegetation zones, and for SJ in the Alpine and Middle Boreal zones; for HG habitat outside the sites was more functional in all zones accept Alpine and Middle Boreal. The majority of N2k sites were of quite small size (<500 ha) and the size influenced their functionality for LSW and HG, with larger N2k sites being more functional. For SJ, however, average functionality of N2k sites was not influenced by their size. The largest average habitat increase linked to considering the contribution of areas outside N2k sites for their functionality as habitat was for the N2k sites of smaller size (1-500 ha). Therefore, the presence and quality of forests outside of N2k sites are of a greater importance for smaller sites, and as such these should be carefully managed. To improve conservation efficiency of the N2k sites in Sweden, we call for incorporating them into the development and implementation of the regional Green Infrastructure plans. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - As the sea level rises and the frequency of intense rains increase, so does the need for climate adaptation. Planning for a successive development of society away from current and future flood prone areas to give room for water is not seen as an alternative in Sweden today, although it could be a strategy that creates long-term security. In this study, we investigated Swedish public authorities' perceptions of planned retreat and flexible land use. This was done through an online survey and interviews directed to officials directly involved in climate adaptation work, at municipalities, County Administration Boards (CABs), Regions, national authorities (NAs), and industry organizations (IOs). The responses were analyzed through the lens of a windows of opportunity approach. The study indicates that the extent to which climate scenarios are used and how far into the future the planning horizon extends in the practical work, varies between governance level which also have impact on the perspectives on planned retreat. The openness for planned retreat and flexible strategies seemed to differ slightly between governance levels in an ascending scale from regions, IOs / NAs, municipalities, to CABs. The survey has generated insights from a large number of respondents at different governance levels sharing their perceptions of retreat and adaptation in Sweden as a main contribution of this work.Difficulties to deal with uncertainties in climate scenarios and considering long-term perspectives were identified as some reasons that close the window for planned retreat. Enabling a flexible use of the land that will gradually become more exposed to flooding and sea level rise could be an intermediate step towards retreat. This would be a way to reframe a closed window of opportunity and begin the process of turning it into something transformative. It could be where the short- and long-term planning meet and a way to reframe our way of thinking about how we live and reside in dynamic waterfront areas, and perhaps lead to a more transformative, safe, and sustainable society for future generations.

AB  - Efficient plant nutrition and good agronomical practices are essential to meet future challenges in agriculture, while high land productivity is an obvious measure to integrate food security and environment protection. However, nutrient management in agriculture, including fertilizer applications and issues linked to nutrient losses, are highly complex due to multidimensional variability. Thus, robust systems of measurements and documentation, including planning, are required in order to support decision-making. Meanwhile skills, competence, and capacities at the farm level represent the key prerequisites for managing the multiple challenges in agriculture and in global food production. This is valid both for Chinese and Norwegian circumstances and constitutes the conceptual framework of a joint research initiative.

AB  - Within Norwegian agriculture, combined dairy and beef production has been identified as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and thus targeted for significant reductions. The article examines the path dependency of the dairy and beef production system in Norway and focuses on identifying lock-ins. The authors used qualitative methods to gather information from stakeholder meetings in Trondelag and Rogaland counties. They explored the stakeholders' responses to two different visions of agriculture in the future: the improved utilisation of outfields using Norwegian Red cattle and increasing production per animal by using feed concentrates. Six key areas of lock-in were identified: technology investment, culture, feeding strategy, policy, access to new farmland through moorland conversion, and ownership of the climate issue. The findings suggest that the current pathway in agriculture is strongly locked into production orientation through these lock-ins, making a production reduction option difficult to implement. There was also widespread belief among the stakeholders that the system of combined dairy and beef production was a climate-friendly option, suggesting that farmers are not convinced that a change in this direction is required. The authors conclude that the option of reducing production would be difficult to implement without addressing the multiple lock-in effects.

AB  - In Sweden, the government's aim to create sustainable urban environments is expressed through the environmental quality objective A good built environment. The objective embraces seven sub-goals and is designed to guide central, regional and local authorities' planning towards urban sustainability. However, for objectives concerning the urban environment, such as the Swedish objective A good built environment, to form a solid basis for decision-making, two types of rationality (functionality) conditions ought to be met. First, the objectives should guide and motivate those who are responsible for their implementation. This is applicable when the goals satisfy the criteria of precision, evaluability, approachability and motivity. Second, when the goals are parts of larger goal systems, the goal systems should be coherent. Using the objective A good built environment as an empirical basis, this article gives a few examples of how environmental goals can fail to guide and motivate action towards improved urban sustainability.

AB  - Fennoscandian boreal forests are managed intensively for wood production, which has had a negative impact on biodiversity. The harvesting pressure on the forests is likely to increase in the future because wood is seen as an important resource in a bio-based economy. Thus, there is an urgent need to better describe the trade-offs between wood production and biodiversity, and to understand how these trade-offs can be alleviated by adapting forest management. Encompassing a broad range of biodiversity aspects, we studied how forest management can increase biodiversity indicators while maintaining or increasing current harvest levels. We found that there is considerable leeway for forestry to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously in Fennoscandian forest landscapes. We show that it is possible to both increase harvests and structural elements of importance for biodiversity compared to present levels in a forest landscape that is representative of conditions in boreal forests in northern Sweden. Achieving this requires a variation in management strategies at the landscape level, and an adaptation of management practices to explicitly consider and implement multiple objectives in the planning process.

AB  - Standardized methods for determining instream flow needs in connection with hydropower development have still not been established in Sweden. However, claims related to conflicting uses of running waters have long engaged the Water Right Courts. Historically, the floating of timber has constituted a strong reason for regulating rivers. Later, the creation of large reservoirs and the subsequent alteration of the natural river flow have mainly been related to the generation of hydroelectricity. In recent decades, the expectations of stakeholders have also been directed at recreational fisheries and the maintenance of biodiversity. Dry channels below diversion points are no longer considered acceptable. Swedish legislation allows for a regular review and reissue of permits to regulate rivers and operate hydroelectric power plants. However, it is only possible to enforce changes which are economically reasonable. The maximum loss of electricity which must be endured by a producer without reciprocal demands of compensation amounts to 5%. Presently, fishing may be regarded as the second most important interest in terms of the use of river resources. Accumulated knowledge of fish ecology makes it possible to use models for the management of fish populations. However, decisions regarding minimum releases of water are usually still based on the natural hydrograph rather than on documented relationships between fish yield and the characteristics of the watercourse. Over the past 7 years, Vattenfall, the largest producer of hydroelectricity in Sweden, has carried out research and development to test, improve and introduce instream flow methods for the management of regulated rivers. Experiences regarding biotope adjustments as an alternative to increased releases of water are presented, and the economic and biodiversity aspects are discussed.

AB  - The concept of woodland key habitats is well-established in northern Europe, denoting sites in the forest landscape with particularly high biodiversity. In Sweden, woodland key habitats have been inventoried on individual forest owner's land by the Swedish Forest Agency since 1993. Recently, various actors have questioned the woodland key habitat concept and its policy implications. To investigate how framing of the concept has changed over time we conducted a media analysis based on theories of collective action frames. The analysis covered the period 1991-2018 and a total of 293 articles in daily newspapers. Our results showed that, over time, woodland key habitats have mostly been framed by government agencies, journalists and environmental organizations as suffering as a result of forestry practices and that nature conservation is the solution to this problem. Actors presenting other or conflicting frames are not as common and they occur mostly when the frequency of articles is high. However, it is noteworthy that individual forest owners sometimes framed themselves as suffering economically from the woodland key habitats, which contrasts with the dominant framing. There were no large differences between national and regional newspapers in the framing of woodland key habitats.

AB  - Climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. To mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. Such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (CWRs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. Conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. We investigate the potential impact of climate change on CWR richness in Norway. The consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 A degrees C temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. The results indicate a pattern of shifting CWR richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. Recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority CWRs in Norway are presented. The methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security.

AB  - Reorientation of fossil fuel industries towards renewable energy, and the role of changes in organizational environment underlying such processes, have not featured strongly in the study of sustainable energy transitions. We contribute to this important policy issue with a case study of the Norwegian oil and gas industry and its engagement in offshore wind power. We study how the engagement has changed during the period 2007-2016, and whether these changes correspond with developments in the industry's task and institutional environments. Our study reveals that despite relatively stable institutional environment and continuous growth in offshore wind market over the last decade, the oil and gas industry's engagement has fluctuated over time. These fluctuations green flings took place during two market downturns in the oil and gas market, while during an oil and gas boom the industry reoriented back to this core market. Our results draw attention to the potential importance of market changes for reorientation of fossil fuel industries towards renewable energy. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for policies seeking to support sustainable energy transitions.

AB  - The knowledge and values of local communities in respect of biodiversity conservation are acknowledged as valuable. This paper explores the constructions and conceptions held by residents in rural areas regarding the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. The locals' constructions are examined qualitatively in three frames: conceptual, spatial and aesthetic. The empirical study was carried out in four communities in the municipality of Lammi, in southern Finland.
   The study revealed that at the local level, biodiversity as a concept is highly elusive and vague. Finnish Agri-environmental Programmes have made the concept of biodiversity more familiar to farmers. Even so, there are still considerable differences between the ways the experts and the local residents perceive the concept of biodiversity. The perceptions of various spatial representations of biodiversity are highly diverse. Biodiversity was widely understood as covering the whole rural ecosystem, including humans. The study also revealed that biodiversity is clearly perceived to be connected to aesthetic appreciations of the rural landscape. In particular, scenic and symbolic rather than ecological aspects are emphasized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Priorities in water use purposes were studied by a two-phase questionnaire in 11 countries/regions on five continents with different water resources and use, socio-economic and cultural conditions. The first phase involved three regions: East Africa (1988), the Baltic region (1994) and Finland (1993, 2001). In the second phase (2001-02), water use purposes were to be viewed 'as they are' and 'as they should be'. On average, community water supply was ranked first, nature conservation second and hydropower third. Priorities varied less than originally anticipated. Priorities should also be remembered in integrated water resources management.

AB  - We describe the calibration and application of the Integrated Catchment Phosphorus model (INCA-P) to determine the key factors controlling run-off, sediment and phosphorus (P) losses from a small catchment in southeast Norway. The INCA-P model was parameterized for five land use categories: forest, grassland, urban areas and agricultural areas with and without autumn tillage. Monitoring data from the Norwegian Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Program were used for model calibration at the outlet of the catchment (Skuterud). Available measurements and local expert knowledge were used as reference data on sediment and P loss specific to land uses. We successfully applied the INCA-P model to Nordic conditions: the NashSutcliffe (N-S) statistic, calculated for the calibration period, was 0.82, 0.71 and 0.67 for run-off, sediment and P losses, respectively. For the validation period, the sediment and P losses were slightly overestimated. Scatter plots of observed versus modelled values of run-off, sediment and total P losses indicated that in some cases, the INCA-P model did not adequately represent extreme situations. It is likely that the modelled system behaves in a different way under moderate and large rainfall events, and the model does not represent these. We applied the model to five land use change scenarios to evaluate the possibilities for reducing particle-bound P loads at the catchment outlet. Our results indicate that land use change can lead to more significant reduction in particle and P losses than changes in agricultural practices. The most favourable scenario for freshwater ecosystems would be afforestation: changing half of the agricultural areas to forest would reduce sediment and P losses by 44 and 40%, respectively. Changes in agricultural practice could also improve the situation, especially by reducing areas with autumn tillage to a minimum.

AB  - The preservation of remaining semi-natural grasslands in Europe has a high conservation priority. Previously, the effects of artificial fertilisation and grazing intensity on grassland animal and plant taxa have been extensively investigated. In contrast, little is known of the effects of tree and shrub cover within semi-natural grasslands and composition of habitats in the surrounding landscape on grassland taxa. We evaluated the effect that each of these factors has on species richness and community structure of vascular plants, butterflies, bumble bees, ground beetles, dung beetles and birds surveyed simultaneously in 31 semi-natural pastures in a farmland landscape in south-central Sweden. Partial correlation analyses showed that increasing proportion of the pasture area covered by shrubs and trees had a positive effect on species richness on most taxa. Furthermore, species richness of nectar seeking butterflies and bumble bees were negatively associated with grazing intensity as reflected by grass height. At the landscape level, species richness of all taxa decreased (butterflies and birds significantly so) with increasing proportion of urban elements in a 1-km(2) landscape area centred on each pasture, while the number of plant and bird species were lower in landscapes with large proportion of arable fields. Our results differed markedly depending on whether the focus was on species richness or community structure. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that the abundance of most taxa was ordered along a gradient describing tree cover within pastures and proportion of arable fields in the landscape. However, subsets of grassland birds and vascular plants, respectively, showed markedly different distribution patterns along axis one of the CCA. In contrast to current conservation policy of semi-natural pastures in Sweden, our results strongly advise against using a single-taxon approach (i.e., grassland vascular plants) to design management and conservation actions in semi-natural pastures. Careful consideration of conservation values linked to the tree and shrub layers in grasslands should always precede decisions to remove trees and shrubs on the grounds of promoting richness of vascular plants confined to semi-natural grasslands. Finally, the importance of landscape composition for mobile organisms such as birds entails that management activities should focus on the wider countryside and not exclusively on single pastures.

AB  - In this paper we document a historical example of high aesthetic valuation of one urban bird species the thrush nightingale (Luscima luscinia) in the late 19th century Helsinki capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland The species is famous for its territorial song that is mostly heard at night The urban thrush nightingales were widely praised and documented in contemporary newspapers For instance the birds of the Paisaniemi Park were mentioned in 1872 26 times in 11 different Finnish newspapers Even poetry dedicated to the birds was published The urban thrush nightingales of the Finnish capital had an impact on contemporary pioneers of animal welfare bird conservation and urban ecology Bird conservation movement organized as Spring Societies (later Sylvia Society) with thrush nightingale as one of its symbols probably had an impact on legal protection granted for nearly all Finnish passerine birds in 1898 Paradoxically aesthetic improvement of the urban park favoured by nightingales destroyed their habitat and the species disappeared for this and other reasons from the capital for several decades (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - There is a strong need for methods within life cycle assessment (LCA) that enable the inclusion of all complex aspects related to land use and land use change (LULUC). This article presents a case study of the use of one hectare (ha) of forest managed for the production of wood for bioenergy production. Both permanent and temporary changes in above-ground biomass are assessed together with the impact on biodiversity caused by LULUC as a result of forestry activities. The impact is measured as a product of time and area requirements, as well as by changes in carbon pools and impacts on biodiversity as a consequence of different management options. To elaborate the usefulness of the method as well as its dependency on assumptions, a range of scenarios are introduced in the study. The results show that the impact on climate change from LULUC dominates the results, compared to the impact from forestry operations. This clearly demonstrates the need to include LULUC in an LCA of forestry products. For impacts both on climate change and biodiversity, the results show large variability based on what assumptions are made; and impacts can be either positive or negative. Consequently, a mere measure of land used does not provide any meaning in LCA, as it is not possible to know whether this contributes a positive or negative impact.

AB  - Vegetation types confined to calcareous bedrocks are often characterized by high species richness, and rare and red-listed plants occur frequently. Snow depth and duration are of particular importance for the floristic composition of mountain vegetation and we therefore wanted to quantify the importance of the date of snowmelt and thereby discuss possible effects of future climate change. In two mountain areas with calcium-rich bedrocks, 106 sample plots (2 x 2 m) were selected by a stratified random sampling, to cover a broad range of snow cover, topography and vegetation composition. Study plots include both the northern boreal zone (NB), the low alpine zone (LA), and the middle alpine zone (MA). Soil data, soil temperature and day of snowmelt were sampled from all plots. Fifteen vegetation (cluster) types were classified by the use of TWINSPAN, and these were well separated in a DCA (Detrended Correspondence Analysis) ordination. A CVA (Canonical Variates Analysis) and Monte Carlo Permutation tests showed that the vegetation types were significantly associated with most of the measured environmental variables, with relative altitude, potassium, and Julian day of snowmelt as the most important variables. All study plots showed relatively high values for soil richness and were significantly negatively correlated with the Julian day when the soil temperature threshold (6 degrees C) was reached. The significant relationships between altitude, Julian day of snowmelt, and vegetation composition indicate that major changes may be expected as a consequence of an earlier snowmelt in a warmer world.

AB  - High-quality biodiversity monitoring is crucial in the era of rapid global biodiversity loss and for the evaluation of conservation outcomes at different spatial scales. Biodiversity offsets are conservation actions that aim to an outcome of no net loss of biodiversity by compensating for the negative impacts from development projects. Successful use of offsets requires that the biodiversity gains and losses between offset and development areas are adequately and comparably measured. Numerous local-level biodiversity surveys are conducted to estimate the biodiversity values of potential development areas in Finland every year. These surveys are done for local planning purposes, and their results are almost never published. We studied Finnish biodiversity surveys to assess their adequacy with regards to biodiversity offsetting. Our data included all biodiversity surveys (n = 206) documented in the region of Southwest Finland during the time period of 1997-2014. We analysed the surveys based on Finnish nature legislation and biodiversity related criteria gathered from other offset and conservation programs. We found the surveys to be inadequate in their assessment of nature values and spatial considerations for offset purposes. We used cluster analysis to study the differences between surveys based on the inventoried nature values and found surveys were clustered into 3 different groups. The characteristics of surveys also varied between individual surveyors. Our results show that the current execution of biodiversity surveys is not compatible enough with the quality of surveys needed for biodiversity offsets. Surveys must be standardized to ensure their comparability and sufficient measurement of biodiversity with ecologically and geographically important features.

AB  - Previous research has shown integrated planning to be important for achieving aims concerning more environmentally friendly transport operations, but less good at explaining prerequisites of implementation. This paper analyses how management and working practises in local authorities, here understood as steering cultures, affect implementation of integrated land-use and public transport planning approaches. The analysis builds on case studies of planning in two Swedish municipalities. These have developed two antithetical steering cultures, namely one that can be described as deliberative and one that can be described as sectorised. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of these steering cultures. The findings show the deliberative model to facilitate integration through advanced mechanisms of consensus and co-ordination between policy-makers and officials. The sectorised model has no such mechanisms, but this need not result in poor prospects of integrated planning. It is important for integrated planning approaches, whatever the steering culture, to be in line with the institutionalised norms and objectives by which planning practices are governed. Integration therefore needs a normative component, so as to ensure implementation. The important normative component in this context can be construed as discourses and rationales concerning transport and the urban development of which public transport forms part.

AB  - This chapter provides a comprehensive account of the institutional interface for wetland conservation and promotion of ecotourism on the shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya. This intervention is part of the ongoing Kisumu Local Interaction Platform (KLIP) under the MISTRA Urban Futures Program headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. Wetlands are fragile ecosystems which provide a stream of ecological services to mankind. These services are grouped into three broad categories: (1) hydrological processes, (2) water quality improvement and (3) wildlife habitat. However, wetlands the world over are critically threatened by anthropogenic activities such as land use conversion to farmlands, grazing, establishment of forest plantations, and encroachment by human settlements, among others. Cases in point are Dunga and Yala wetlands on the shores of Lake Victoria. Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater Lake after Lake Superior in America, is also threatened by the stubborn water hyacinth, thereby impacting negatively on fishing and water transport with resultant loss of income to the local fishing community. MISTRA Urban Futures brings together local universities of Maseno and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, Chalmers University (Sweden), City Council of Kisumu, the local fishing community, local NGOs and other stakeholders under an umbrella platform referred to as KLIP. The main objective of KLIP is to achieve sustainable development in Kisumu City and its environs. Ecotourism is being promoted as an alternative livelihood to the age-old fishing and peasant farming practices which have proved to be unsustainable. Local universities are involved in co-production of knowledge in partnership with the local community represented by Beach Management Units (BMUs) and other stakeholders. Currently 20 (10 Ph.D. and 10 Master's) candidates of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology are involved in transdisciplinary research focusing on ecotourism. The research findings are to provide new and greater insights into development of ecotourism as a model for conservation of natural resources and improvement of local people's welfare. The platform provides a perfect example of the involvement of higher educational institutions in addressing society's problems and the role of such institutions in sustainable development goal attainment. Bonding among Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, County Government of Kisumu and the local community is now very strong, and this chapter argues that such partnership should be replicated elsewhere within the eastern Africa region and beyond.

AB  - Modern forestry, which mainly consists of clear-cutting, is one of the most important factors influencing today's boreal forests. In Sweden, the breaking point for modern forestry is generally considered to be around 1950. Recently, our common knowledge of the implementation of clear-cutting in Sweden has increased, and new research indicates that clear-cutting systems were already applied before the 1950s. In this case study, we used aerial photographs from the 1940s to analyze the extent of contemporaneous clear-cuts and even-aged young forests in an area in northern Sweden. Our results show that almost 40% of the study area had already been clear-cut by the end of the 1940s, but also that clear-cutting had been applied to 10% of the forest land in the early 1900s. This implies that the historical development of forestry in northern Sweden is more complex than previously thought, and that certain proportions of the forest land were already second-generation forests in the 1950s. Our results have implications for the use of concepts such as "continuity forest", suggesting that this concept should employ a time frame of at least 100 years.

AB  - Today, the Old Town of Porvoo is an icon of a historic town in Finland. The town was established around the church during the 14th century. The main, slightly curved streets run parallel to the river. Further medieval features include the block division, where the blocks reach down to the river and the frontage of merchants' storerooms is by the river bank. The wooden buildings in Porvoo are younger than the urban structure, as they have been built after the fire of 1760.
   The Old Town of Porvoo has been a predecessor concerning safeguarding of Finnish urban heritage. The first plan with protection intentions for the area was approved in 1915. It appealed to good will of owners with new arrangements. Although the aim was at preserving, the impact would be in fact an eminent transformation of the area.
   The Planning Act of 1932 gave an option to declare an area of historical significance as the "Old Town", thus supporting preservation of consistent urban historical sites. The Old Town of Porvoo got this status, together with a new plan. The aim of the plan was declared to preserve the street lines, size and form of plots and scale as such. Some public stone buildings got conservation regulations as "cultural history under protection of town". The view towards the shore was considered worth for protection. As a consequence to this plan, the Old Town got new buildings, which' scale in principle fit the area, but not their materials, details or general design.
   In 1939 the Archaeological Commission (present National Board of Antiquities) started for the first time in Finland inventories of urban heritage in two wooden towns. In Porvoo, this kind of study was made in 1940ies. The analyses focused on some twenty selected buildings. The criterion for an elite building was the highest possible age and purity of style. The main focus was on the public buildings. The analyses aimed at assisting art historical research; to document buildings on file before demolition. The urban conservation in a comprehensive scale was not imaginable.
   The third' generation's plan was elaborated during the 1960's, when the threat towards urban heritage rose due to rapid structural changes in the Finnish society. The plan entered in force 1974. It included a comprehensive inventory, with three cultural value assessment categories; 1) important as such,2) important as part of the significant environment 3) no need for protection.
   The current plan was prepared by 1992. In the plan, the building area is defined mostly according to the existing buildings. New constructions are strictly regulated according to existing ones. Permission for demolishing a building can not be admitted before the building permit of the site is approved. The regulation that "sold" the conservation is that one can "furnish" rooms to attics outside the permitted building volume with certain preconditions. Interiors are not mentioned, and their protection is a problem. These plans provide a brief documentation for a review of the Finnish development of urban conservation by planning. Even by reading the plans, it is possible to notice a certain development of argumentation. The content of conservation has enlarged. It seems as if many "hard facts" hindering the conservation, such as traffic, demands of more sunlight and clear air, have changed. The "soft values"; the attraction and fascination of the past, traditions, magnitude of a historic townscape, have been quite permanent.

AB  - 1. Seed bank and seed rain represent dispersal in time and space. They can be important sources of diversity in the rural landscape, where fragmented habitats are linked by their histories.
   2. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation were sampled in four habitat types (abandoned semi-natural grassland (ABA), grazed former arable field (FAF), mid-field islet (MFI) and grazed semi-natural grassland (SNG)) in a rural landscape in southern Sweden, to examine whether community patterns can be distinguished at large spatial scales and whether seed bank and seed rain are best explained by current, past or intended future vegetation communities.
   3. We counted 54 357 seedlings of 188 species from 1190 seed bank and 797 seed rain samples. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation communities differed according to habitat. Several species characteristic of managed grassland vegetation were present in the seed bank, seed rain and vegetation of the other habitats.
   4. The seed banks of SNGs and the seed rain of the FAFs were generally better predicted by the surrounding above-ground vegetation than were the other habitat types. The seed rain of the grazed communities was most similar to the vegetation in the FAFs, while the seed banks of the abandoned grasslands most resembled the vegetation in SNGs.
   5. Gap availability and seed input could be limiting the colonisation of target species in FAFs, while remnant populations in the seed bank and the presence of grassland specialists in the above-ground vegetation indicate that abandoned grasslands and mid-field islets could be valuable sources of future diversity in the landscape after restoration.
   6. Synthesis and applications. SNG communities are able to form seed banks which survive land-use change, but their seed rain does not reflect their above-ground communities. It is important that grassland plants set seed. By connecting existing grasslands with restoration targets, increased disturbance in the target habitats would allow for colonisation via the seed bank or seed rain, while decreased grazing intensity would benefit seed production in the source grasslands. Otherwise, landscape-wide propagule availability might increase with a more varied timing and intensity of management.

AB  - Urban lakes provide multiple benefits to society while influencing life quality. Moreover, lakes and their microbiomes are sentinels of anthropogenic impact and can be used for natural resource management and planning. Here, we release original metagenomic data from several well-characterized and anthropogenically impacted eutrophic lakes in the vicinity of Stockholm (Sweden). Our goal was to collect representative microbial community samples and use shotgun sequencing to provide a broad view on microbial diversity of productive urban lakes. Our dataset has an emphasis on Lake Malaren as a major drinking water reservoir under anthropogenic impact. This dataset includes short-read sequence data and metagenome assemblies from each of 17 samples collected from eutrophic lakes near the greater Stockholm area. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and obtained 2378 metagenome assembled genomes that de-replicated into 514 species representative genomes. This dataset adds new datapoints to previously sequenced lakes and it includes the first sequenced set of metagenomes from Lake Malaren. Our dataset serves as a baseline for future monitoring of drinking water reservoirs and urban lakes.

AB  - The aim of the article is to identify and analyse innovative statutory regulation to address the challenges of biodiversity conservation, especially in relation to private forests. Four countries (Finland, Sweden, France and Australia) are scanned for innovative approaches and the identified instruments are classified into five categories according to the level and intensity of government interference. Advantages and drawbacks of the different instrument types related to their effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, fairness and acceptability are examined from a theoretical point of view. Compared to traditional measures of nature conservation, the examined innovative instruments provide for more flexibility relating to the nature of restrictions, scope, implementation or adjustability. This is aimed at improving acceptability among regulatees while upholding various degrees of government interference. On the basis of our analysis, innovations to address specific biodiversity challenges may be identified and new solutions developed.

AB  - Natura 2000 sites are expected to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. It follows that successful management of the sites is of great importance. Next to goal attainment, cost-effectiveness is increasingly recognised as a key requirement for gaining social and political acceptance for costly conservation measures. We identify and qualitatively examine issues of cost-effectiveness related to the design and implementation of management measures in Natura 2000 sites in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. Given the wide variety of management design and implementation options within the four countries, our study is purely of an exploratory nature. We derive recommendations for improving the cost-effectiveness of management in Natura 2000 sites and for future research. Examples of policy recommendations include guaranteeing the availability of funds for longer periods, and ensuring the appropriate allocation of funds between the different tasks of designing and implementing management plans. Further research should examine the cost-effectiveness of controversial suggestions such as, for example, more tailored payment schemes for conservation measures that result in higher ecological outputs but are costly to administer. Moreover, more research is needed to better understand how rules for administrations, as well as rules and governance structures for tasks within administrations, should be designed.

AB  - The residential district Bo01 in Malmo, south Sweden, was built in the years 2000-2001 on former industrial land. Measures have been undertaken to counteract the negative impact of urban sprawl on the ecosystem. Houses are built close together to use the land efficiently. Still, it is a green district, thanks to two planning instruments, green space factor and green points, e.g. a majority of the buildings have green roofs. The greening of the area aims to present an attractive green surrounding for people, promote biodiversity, and minimise storm water run-off. Storm water is managed in an open system which includes ponds with native vegetation. The green space factor means that different types of surfaces are given different credits. Plant beds, climbing plants, green roofs, and ponds are given high credits. No credit is given to sealed surfaces. The green points include for example: a bird nesting box for each apartment, a courtyard containing at least 50 Swedish wild flower species, food for birds all year round in the yard. In the parks, semi-natural biotopes have been built comprising meadow, oak and beech woodland, and alder carr. The soil and the species composition of grasses, wild flowers, bushes and trees conform as far as possible with their natural counterparts. Before the area was developed, sea birds such as avocet and terns, nested on the old industrial sites. A compensation biotope for birds will be created in the northern harbour of Malmo. Studies show that the inhabitants are very satisfied with the quality of the parks and gardens. Biodiversity is lower than in a similar, but older residential district that has been used as a comparison. Biodiversity is expected to increase with time.

AB  - Culturally modified trees (CMTs) provide unique insights into traditional knowledge and uses of the forest ecosystems. In close relation to pre-industrial livestock herding in central Sweden, it was a custom to carve text and symbols on trees and use them as "notice boards" in the forest. The main aim of this study was to document and analyse remaining carved trees in a managed forest landscape of 160 km(2). The same area was surveyed twice, once in 1986 and once in 2003. 488 carved trees were documented and classified into legible themes that were interpreted in the light of past herding practices. Name was the most common theme, found in 85% of the carvings. Most of the carvings were made in the period from the 1750s until the early 1900s. The custom of carving on trees was closely related to important grazing areas and the need to establish rights to them. The main losses of carved trees nowadays are due to their natural death and decay as most of the carved trees are located in areas that are not targeted for management. A primary recommendation for preservation is therefore to continue documentation of the trees because of the noticeable deterioration in readability of the carvings.

AB  - QuestionsChanged land use, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and the spread of non-native species have repeatedly been reported as the main drivers of recent floristic changes in northern Europe. However, the relevance of the geographical scale at which floristic changes are observed is less well understood and it has only rarely been possible to quantify biodiversity loss. Therefore, we assessed changes in species richness, species composition and mean ecological indicator values (EIVs) at three nested geographic scales during two different time periods, each ca 30 years, since the mid-1900s.LocationTwo parishes in central Scania, southernmost Sweden.MethodsWe analyzed species presence/absence data from three inventories at ca 30-year intervals over 1957-2021 and three geographic scales (157 m(2), ca 7 km(2) and ca 45 km(2)) to document temporal trends and differences between geographic scales in terms of species richness, species composition and mean EIVs.ResultsWe found shifts in species composition across all geographical scales. However, the magnitude of biodiversity loss and the main drivers of these changes were scale-dependent. At the smallest spatial scale, we saw a dramatic loss of plant biodiversity with local species richness in 2021 being only 48% of that of 1960. In contrast, at the larger geographic scales no significant changes in species richness were observed because species losses were compensated for by gains of predominantly non-native species, which made up at least 78% of the new species richness. At the smallest spatial scale, changed land use (ceased grazing/mowing and intensified forestry) appeared as the main driver, while an increasing proportion of non-native species, as well as climatic changes and increasing nitrogen loads appeared relatively more important at larger geographic scales.ConclusionOur results highlight the precarious situation for biodiversity in the region and at the same time the fundamental importance of geographic scale in studies of biodiversity change. Both the magnitude and drivers of changes may differ depending on the geographic scale and must be considered also when previously published studies are interpreted.

AB  - The conceptual framework of biocultural heritage allows for new approaches to heritage, nature conservation, landscape planning and development goals, providing means to negotiate management goals in these areas, and in certain cases, also to combine them. By reviewing knowledge from the literature, this paper develops a new conceptual framework of biocultural heritage. Five "elements" constitute biocultural heritage in this framework. First, ecosystem memories denote biophysical properties, non-human organisms and agents changed or affected directly or indirectly by humans. Second, landscape memories represent tangible materialised human practice and semi-intangible ways of organising landscapes, such as built environments and archaeological sites, and settlement systems linked to user and property rights. Third, place-based memories refer to intangible living features of human knowledge and communication expressed in know-how, place names, orature, arts, ideas and culture, received, preserved and transmitted over generations. The fourth element, integrated landscape analysis, denotes a toolbox and a conceptual framework for knowledge construction and landscape management. The final fifth element of biocultural heritage, stewardship and change, represents the activity of, and ability in, exploring memory reservoirs of biocultural heritage for transferring knowledge to policy and management and for shaping collaborative initiatives. To illustrate the framework, this paper then presents a study from the village Angersjo located in the boreal forest in central Sweden. As conclusion, we suggest that the approach - with improvements and modifications - represents an operational joint framework for exploring and managing biocultural heritage, drawing on the past for envisioning the future.

AB  - So far no calculations have been made for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from forestry in East Norway. This region stands for 80 % of the Norwegian timber production. The aim of this study was to assess the annual GHG emissions of Norwegian forestry in the eastern parts of the country from seed production to final felling and transport of timber to sawmill and wood processing industry (cradle-to-gate inventory), based on specific Norwegian data.
   The life cycle inventory was conducted with SimaPro applying primary and secondary data from Norwegian forestry. GHG emissions of fossil-related inputs from the technosphere were calculated for the functional unit of 1 m(3) timber extracted and delivered to industry gate in East Norway in 2010. The analysis includes seed and seedling production, silvicultural operations, forest road construction and upgrading, thinning, final felling, timber forwarding and timber transport on road and rail from the forest to the industry. Norwegian time studies of forestry machines and operations were used to calculate efficiency, fuel consumption and transport distances. Due to the lack of specific Norwegian data in Ecoinvent, we designed and constructed unit processes based on primary and secondary data from forestry in East Norway.
   GHG emissions from forestry in East Norway amounted to 17.893 kg CO2-equivalents per m(3) of timber delivered to industry gate in 2010. Road transport of timber accounted for almost half of the total GHG emissions, final felling and forwarding for nearly one third of the GHG emissions. Due to longer road transport distances, pulpwood had higher impact on the climate change category than saw timber. The construction of forest roads had the highest impact on the natural land transformation category. The net CO2 emissions of fossil CO2 corresponded to 2.3 % of the CO2 sequestered by 1 m(3) of growing forest trees and were compared to a calculation of biogenic CO2 release from the forest floor as a direct consequence of harvesting.
   Shorter forwarding and road transport distances, increased logging truck size and higher proportion of railway transport may result in lower emissions per volume of transported timber. A life cycle assessment of forestry may also consider impacts on environmental categories other than climate change. Biogenic CO2 emissions from the soil may be up to 10 times higher than the fossil-related emissions, at least in a short-term perspective, and are highly dependent on stand rotation length.

AB  - While urbanisation contributes to global biodiversity declines, flower-rich urban habitats may provide beneficial pollinator habitats. We investigated the potential of urban residential areas to contribute to pollinator diversity by analysing wild bee and hoverfly species richness and composition of species assemblages of summer-active species, sampled in 53 gardens across urban and rural landscapes of Malmo, the regional capital of Sweden's southernmost county. Species richness differed between urban and rural gardens, and between four urban residential types (ranging from low human density and high vegetation cover, to high human density and low vegetation cover), and taxonomic groups responded differently. Solitary bee species richness was higher in urban than rural gardens, driven by a higher richness in low-density urban gardens compared to both high-density urban gardens and rural gardens. In contrast, bumblebee species richness was higher in rural than urban gardens, whereas differences among the urban types were less clear. Hoverfly species richness was consistently higher in rural gardens than any urban garden type. Species richness of all groups was negatively related to human population density at the landscape scale (radius 500 m), but unrelated to vegetation cover. This indicates that population density affects pollinator habitat quality through associated green space management and design. Rural and urban wild bee species assemblages consisted of different species (significant species turnover), whereas urban hoverfly assemblages were a subset of rural ones (significant nestedness). Species nestedness of hoverflies, but not bees, increased with human population density. We show that urban areas can complement the regional wild bee species pool, mainly caused by large variation in tenure and management at small spatial scales, while urbanisation drives a systematic loss of hoverfly species. We suggest alternatives to improve dense residential areas for pollinators.

AB  - Changes at the landscape level in a 100 ha area of southern Finland, have led to homogenization over the period 1954-1997, as measured by Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and Shannon's evenness index (SHEI). Patch numbers (N), class areas (CA), and total edge lengths (TE) of ditch margins decreased markedly due to subsurface drainage. Woodland patches also decreased, as some of them were brought under cultivation, but increased in 4997 due to the demolishing of barns. An assessment of the social costs and benefits of subsurface drainage shows that it is not desirable to replace the few ditch margins that remain in the case area with subsurface drains. The management of field margins, buffer strips along waterways and woodland patches are included in the Finnish agri-environmental programme, but their importance for management of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape should be emphasized. The paper analyses landscape diversity loss at landscape and patch levels, and describes the roles of woodland patches and field margins in an agricultural landscape. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) is an endangered freshwater species in Europe. The main threat is from lethal crayfish plague, caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci that has been spread over Europe by introduced North American crayfish species, acting as chronic carriers of the disease. Most of the remaining noble crayfish populations are found in the Baltic Sea area, and there is an urgent need to implement conservation actions to slow down or halt the extinction rate in this region. However, limited knowledge about the genetic structure of populations in this area has so far precluded the development of conservation strategies that take genetic aspects into consideration. Key objectives of this large-scale genetic study, covering 77 locations mainly from northern Europe, were to describe the contemporary population genetic structure of the noble crayfish in the Fennoscandian peninsula (Sweden, Norway, and Finland), taking postglacial colonization history into account, and to evaluate how human activities such as stocking have affected the genetic structure of the populations. Analyses of 15 microsatellite markers revealed three main genetic clusters corresponding to populations in northern, middle, and southern Fennoscandia, with measures of genetic diversity being markedly higher within populations in the southern cluster. The observed genetic structure probably mirrors two main colonizations of the Baltic Sea basin after the last glaciation period. At the same time, several deviations from this pattern were observed, reflecting past human translocations of noble crayfish. The results are discussed in relation to the conservation and management of this critically endangered species. In particular, we recommend increased efforts to protect the few remaining noble crayfish populations in southern Fennoscandia and the use of genetic information when planning stocking activities, such as reintroductions following local extinctions.

AB  - We examined how the structure of a boreal forest landscape is related to the occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel Pteromys volans in northern Finland. The flying squirrel inhabits mature spruce-dominated (Picea abies) mixed forests and is categorised as vulnerable species due to habitat loss and change. We classified a landscape of 374.5 km(2) into potential habitat patches, potential dispersal areas, and areas incapable of being inhabited using national forest inventory data, and surveyed all 136 potential habitat patches for the presence of the species. Different landscape variables were defined, and also connections by the shortest distances to neighbouring habitat patches along both straight lines and least-cost distances based on specific movement costs were measured. Occupied patches were larger in size, contained more deciduous trees for food and nesting cavities, and were in closer proximity to the nearest occupied patches. Occupied patches were mainly located below 300 m a.s.l. The occurrence of flying squirrels was correctly predicted for 88% of the habitat patches using landscape variables. This modelling result proved to be rather general. In addition, the configuration of occupied patches was mainly clustered across the landscape, and distant occupied patches seemed to be linked to other patches via forested connections. We suggest that maintaining a clustered arrangement of good quality habitat patches and regenerating new potential habitat as well as dispersal areas between the habitat patches seem to be appropriate goals for long-term forest management planning to sustain populations of the flying squirrel in the landscape.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to sum up knowledge of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photography as a tool for vegetation data for mapping and monitoring in environmental and biodiversity surveys and change detection surveillance. It compiles thirty years of research of the main ecosystems in Swedish vegetation, where the overall goal was to develop methods for mapping and monitoring vegetation by use of CIR aerial photographs, assess the accuracy compared to field-based mapping and to implement them as a tool in nature conservation and environmental planning. The methods include development of a classification system, identification and analysis of indicators, development of interpretation techniques, and evaluation compared to the data collected in the field. The CIR observable criteria are colour, texture, pattern, size, form, and density, based on spectral reflectance, physiognomy, life forms, ecological conditions, moisture and nutrition, vegetation period and phenology, topography, site conditions, and management methods. The methods have been used to produce vegetation maps of mountains, boreal forests, and mires in northern and central Sweden, in national inventories of wetlands, ancient meadows and pastures, key biotopes in forests and for monitoring agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Forestry may cause adverse impacts on water quality, and the forestry planning process is a key factor for the outcome of forest operation effects on stream water. To optimise environmental considerations and to identify actions needed to improve or maintain the stream biodiversity, two silvicultural water management tools, BIS+ (biodiversity, impact, sensitivity and added values) and Blue targeting, have been developed. In this study, we evaluate the links between survey variables, based on BIS+ and Blue targeting data, and water chemistry in 173 randomly selected headwater streams in the hemiboreal zone. While BIS+ and Blue targeting cannot replace more sophisticated monitoring methods necessary for classifying water quality in streams according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC), our results lend support to the idea that the BIS+ protocol can be used to prioritise the protection of riparian forests. The relationship between BIS+ and water quality indicators (concentrations of nutrients and organic matter) together with data from fish studies suggests that this field protocol can be used to give reaches with higher biodiversity and conservation values a better protection. The tools indicate an ability to mitigate forestry impacts on water quality if the operations are adjusted to this knowledge in located areas.

AB  - Pseudorchis albida s.s. is today a rather rare grassland orchid with a declining distribution in Scandinavia, as well as in other parts of Europe. This paper presents (a) ecological site descriptions from 30 Norwegian and Swedish sites, and (b) vegetation analyses from five Swedish populations of the closely related, alpine R straminea, which enable sonic, comparisons between taxa. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination of vegetation data separated sites of P. albida rather well according to their geographical location. The Swedish south-west coast sites were particularly distinct. The Norwegian mid inland region constituted a transition zone between sites from the Norwegian west coast and sites from the Swedish eastern mountains. About 10 vascular plant species form a core group, common to nearly all sites. About 150 species occur in lower total frequencies than 50%. It is concluded that P. albida can occur in a wide array of plant communities. A Kendall correlation matrix for environmental variables for the R albida sites and the site's scores along the three first axes in the DCA ordination showed significant correlations between altitude, soil-pH, grazing, precipitation, mowing, ignition loss, and soil-potassium, with vegetation clusters.

AB  - Solutions for resource scarcity should be sought from urban waste management and sanitation, which are characterised by central plants and long networks. The socio-technical transition to more sustainable infrastructure is expected to include partial decentralisation based on local conditions. This paper focuses on drivers, barriers and enablers in implementing a decentralised circular system in a new residential area (Tampere, Finland). In the alternative system, biowaste and feces are treated in a local biogas plant, and nutrient and energy output are utilised within the area. This research aims to understand what kind of urban planning enables alternative infrastructure, as well as the characteristics of an innovation capable of making a breakthrough. Seventeen infrastructure planning experts were interviewed, then assembled to re-develop ideas arising from the interviews. Based on these qualitatively analysed data, 11 factors which help the adoption of the alternative system were formulated. The results indicate that sustainability transition can be facilitated through impartial urban planning that allows the early participation of actors and improved communications. Additionally, studying the impact of alternative solutions and city guidance according to environmental policy aims may enhance transition. Innovation success factors include suitable locations, competent partners, mature technology and visible local benefits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many parts of the world, the success of biodiversity conservation strongly depends on the decisions of private landowners. These decisions are guided by the shared perceptions of the biodiversity problem. In this study, we applied a mixed method critical discourse analysis and examined how alternative discourses of biodiversity guide Finnish forest owners to maintain, or not maintain, biodiversity on their lands. Data collection combined a preliminary interview (n = 24) with a forest owner survey (n = 452).
   We identified four discourses of biodiversity. The concerned discourse acknowledges the biodiversity problems in forests caused by current forestry. The sceptical discourse denies the existence of all biodiversity problems and defends contemporary forestry against the accusations of environmentalists. The harmonising discourse emphasises the harmony of all forest uses in the spirit of multi-objective forestry. The uninvolved discourse distances itself from the biodiversity issue. Overall, only 21% of the survey respondents worried about biodiversity loss in Finnish forests.
   The discourses illustrate three different ways in which Finnish forest owners moderate the cognitive dissonance caused by 'unpleasant' information on biodiversity loss by either excluding or rejecting it, or assimilating it into multi-objective harmony. Overcoming these kinds of discursive barriers - the mechanisms that help decision-makers ignore alarming realities - is a major challenge for all those who aim to halt biodiversity loss.

AB  - BioScene (scenarios for reconciling biodiversity conservation with declining agriculture use in mountain areas in Europe) was a three-year project (2002-2005) funded by the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme, and aimed to investigate the implications of agricultural restructuring and decline for biodiversity conservation in the mountain areas of Europe.
   The research took a case study approach to the analysis of the biodiversity processes and outcomes of different scenarios of agri-environmental change in six countries (France, Greece, Norway, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) covering the major biogeographical regions of Europe. The project was coordinated by Imperial College London, and each study area had a multidisciplinary team including ecologists and social and economic experts, which sought a comprehensive understanding of the drivers for change and their implications for sustainability.
   A key component was the sustainability assessment (SA) of the alternative scenarios. This article discusses the development and application of the SA methodology developed for BioScene. While the methodology was objectives-led, it was also strongly grounded in baseline ecological and socio-economic data. This article also describes the engagement of stakeholder panels in each study area and the use of causal chain analysis for understanding the likely implications for land use and biodiversity of strategic drivers of change under alternative scenarios for agriculture and rural policy and for biodiversity management. Finally, this article draws conclusions for the application of SA more widely, its use with scenarios, and the benefits of stakeholder engagement in the SA process.

AB  - In Sweden, local and regional planning practices are faced with the challenge of managing rapid growth in expansive urban regions. However, spatial planning should also contribute to the fulfilment of formalized sustainability objectives and support sustainable development. This includes addressing cross-cutting sustainability issues that transcend established administrative and territorial boundaries. Thus, the management of sustainability issues requires attention from actors at different levels, and challenges how contemporary planning practices plan for development. Based in the expansive Stockholm region, this study explores the cross-level interaction in spatial planning and decision-making and planning practitioners' experiences and apprehensions of contemporary municipal planning practices with a focus on statutory plans to achieve sustainability targets and objectives. The results show that municipal planning organizations are under pressure because of rapid urban expansion. It is concluded that the role, format and content of statutory as well as informal planning instruments are decisive for the cross-level interaction between planning levels. Moreover, planning instruments find new trajectories resulting in mismatches in expectations from planners at adjacent planning levels. This influences the interplay and preconditions for achieving national and regional sustainability targets and objectives.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to develop a social sustainability tool to clarify what social sustainability means in land use planning processes. The tool was developed through a robust research process covering a large amount of scientific literature and built environment sustainability assessment tools. To assess how the developed tool works in practice, we used it as a coding system for the assessment of social sustainability in a case study from Finland. The case study includes the master planning process of a medium-sized city and the legal framework guiding it. The theoretical contribution of the paper lies in creating a holistic tool for the assessment of social sustainability in planning processes. This study also provides a strong practical contribution, as it goes beyond theoretical definitions to the pragmatic level by providing exemplary measures to be used in designing and implementing processes. Therefore, this paper is a valuable source for those stakeholders (for example planners, developers and policymakers), who struggle with the issue of the successful implementation of social sustainability practices, and it will help them to benchmark their processes against the themes found in the tool.

AB  - Context 'Conserving Nature's stage' has been advanced as an important conservation principle because of known links between biodiversity and abiotic environmental diversity, especially in sensitive high-latitude environments and at the landscape scale. However these links have not been examined across gradients of human impact on the landscape.
   Objectives To (1) analyze the relationships between land-use intensity and both landscape-scale biodiversity and geodiversity, and (2) assess the contributions of geodiversity, climate and spatial variables to explaining vascular plant species richness in landscapes of low, moderate and high human impact.
   Methods We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze relationships between land-use intensity and both geodiversity (geological, geomorphological and hydrological richness) and plant species richness in 6191 1-km(2) grid squares across Finland. We used linear regression-based variation partitioning (VP) to assess contributions of climate, geodiversity and spatial variable groups to accounting for spatial variation in species richness.
   Resluts In GAMs, geodiversity correlated negatively, and plant species richness positively, with land-use intensity. Both relationships were non-linear. In VP, geodiversity best accounted for species richness in areas of moderate to high human impact. These overall contributions were mainly due to variation explained jointly with climate, which dominated the models. Independent geodiversity contributions were highest in pristine environments, but low throughout.
   Conclusions Human action increases biodiversity but may reduce geodiversity, at landscape scale in high-latitude environments. Better understanding of the connections between biodiversity and abiotic environment along changing land-use gradients is essential in developing sustainable measures to conserve biodiversity under global change.

AB  - This paper summarises environmental monitoring activities and small plot research in agriculture as practiced in the Heilongjiang province located northeast in China and in Norway. For both countries, there is a need to recommend efficient mitigation measures to farmers and monitor the environmental effect of agricultural systems and management practices. Climate change scenarios predict changes in precipitation which potentially can influence agricultural practices as well as lead to changes in run-off and related to land use as well as the environment losses. As such, cooperation in the further development of monitoring programmes and related techniques will be useful in documenting both present and future, climate change-induced changes, related land use as well as the environmental.

AB  - The Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis) is the only endemic mammal in Finland. At present the total population size of this subspecies is c. 250 individuals. Because the seal feeds on fish, and because of its value particularly as a source of meat, oil and leather, hunting was allowed until 1955. Conservation of the seal and some of its lairing areas by means of fishing restrictions requires the adoption of new attitudes. Semi-structured interviews elucidated the basis of conflicts concerning protection of the Saimaa ringed seal and fishing in Lake Pihlajavesi, Finland, where one of the most viable populations of the seal lives. Socio-economic position largely determined personal attitudes towards conservation; local landowners felt that their use of natural resources was restricted, while summer cottage owners wanted strict conservation. Commercial fishers considered the protection of the ringed seal unnecessary and a waste of money. Conservation biologists believed that the proposed actions were necessary to reduce the risk of extinction. Attitudes were also widely influenced by culture and social backgrounds. Those influenced by the traditional Finnish peasant/nature relationship had a different vision of nature from the conservationists who were influenced by modern science. Questions raised by the protection of the Saimaa ringed seal form an example of transition of an environmental conflict to larger-scale criticism of ongoing structural transformation in society. It is obvious that if nature conservation requires the approval of all social groups, it needs a change of authoritarian measures and acceptance of local knowledge, which should be used alongside scientific knowledge in management. Nature conservation policy led by specialists and authorities could be seen as widening the gap between urban and rural areas.

AB  - Within a mosaic of agricultural and urbanized landscapes, shrub habitats are important refuges that help maintain biodiversity. Unfortunately, these habitats have been dramatically altered over the past several decades for practical and esthetic reasons. Continued rapid growth of suburban areas has accelerated this shift in habitat quality. Management strategies that promote shrub habitat within developed areas are rarely greeted with public acceptance because bushy thickets (e.g. Rubus brambles) shelter undesired species of animals (e.g. snakes, small mammals) and are typically associated with a lack of property maintenance. We conducted an experiment in a heavily impacted suburban habitat (population density of similar to 2700 humans/km(2)). Our study site, containing forest and meadow habitats, was adjacent to a large city (similar to 320,000 inhabitants) and visited by >70,000 people annually. We manipulated the forest habitat by removing trees, and through active maintenance, thereby promoting the growth of brambles. Within six years, we observed that newly-created shrub habitat was rapidly colonized by snakes, notably Vipera aspis. The total number of detected individuals increased markedly over time. Numerous advertising and educational activities about snake ecology were conducted in parallel, especially with school children. Complaints from the public were absent which demonstrates that management strategies that favor unpopular organisms are feasible, even in densely populated areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As in many parts of Europe, two opposing forces of change have shaped Norwegian agricultural landscapes during the last decades: intensification of cultivation in favourable areas and abandonment of marginal areas. The resulting landscape changes have a multitude of consequences; for agricultural production, landscape aesthetics, recreational and amenity values of the landscape, and for biodiversity. This paper uses agricultural statistics and aerial photographs to analyse and compare the patterns of change in one typical intensively cultivated area and one traditional mountain-farm landscape during the last half-century. Results show that further intensification of the intensively managed landscape has led to an increasingly homogeneous, :large-scale landscape featuring fewer boundaries. In contrast, reduced management in the mountain-farm system has resulted in an increasingly heterogeneous, small-scale landscape. Some probable effects of past and future landscape changes are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus) has its European northern range limit in northern Norway, and is a species of national conservation concern due to its small population size and unknown population trend. Long-term monitoring at the range limit suggests breeding site use is in decline. We used annual occupancy data from 104 breeding lakes monitored since 1991 in northern Norway to investigate correlates of change in occupancy. Persistence was 100 % until 1999, but thereafter decreased to 25 % (26 lakes with breeding pairs). A particularly steep decrease occurred between 2010 and 2012. Persistence increased with the number of pairs present in each lake in the initial monitoring year of 1991. The number of grebe pairs also decreased in the lakes that had continuous breeding persistence over the entire 22-year monitoring period, suggesting that a large-scale factor caused the population decline. Over the last year of the monitoring series, lake altitude was negatively related to the probability of persistence, indicative that locally harsh climate played some role in breeding distribution. The temporal pattern of persistence was not related to mean winter temperature at the breeding sites; however, the decrease between 2010 and 2011 coincided with a late ice melt in 2010. Monitoring that includes a larger area of the species' range is required to conclude whether the observed decline can indicate an overall decline in population size, or range fluctuations at the edge of the species' range. However, investigating the processes that determine population range borders can give insights into important limiting factors pertinent to the conservation of species in the long term.

AB  - Forests are under increasing pressure with increasing risk of conflicts between stakeholder groups with different interests in sustainable forest management (SFM). This study investigated the different dimensions of conflict as perceived by private forest owners and other stakeholders, and the likely impact of these pressures on SFM in a southern Swedish context. Data were collected through a mixed methods approach using qualitative in-depth individual semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a quantitative survey (n = 6-161), with questions on present and past conflicts, actors, drivers, acting, management and solutions. Stakeholders felt that in the past the conflicts were more about technical dimensions of forestry practice, and today more about the political and cultural dimensions of forestry issues. The most frequently mentioned reason for forest conflict was forest protection, especially woodland key habitats. In all conflicts, forest owners emphasised the importance of knowledge, responsibility and emotions. Other stakeholders did too, but with emotions less emphasised. In managing conflict, meetings, adaptation and education were stressed by stakeholders. Dialogue arenas on different levels are needed for all stakeholders. Governing bodies also need to realise the implication different approaches and strategies have on forest owners management.

AB  - In Finland, management of biological diversity at the landscape level is complicated by the relatively small size of the holdings. To alleviate this problem, this study presents a hierarchical planning model that aims at combining spatial landscape-level ecological goals with holding-level owner-specific goals. The influence of ecological objectives extends across holding borders, but their impact is greatest in areas where they are least in conflict with the owners' goals. This feature, which results in minimum losses to individual landowners, can be called ecological efficiency. In the case study, the ecological objective was to cluster the breeding and foraging areas of flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). Other sets of objectives were related to individual holdings according to the various preferences of the forest owners. The forest plan produced by the presented planning model was compared with two other forest plans: 1) a combination of independent forest holding level plans, which were assumed to represent the outcome of the current planning tradition, and 2) an area-level plan, where the holding borders and holding-specific objectives were not taken into account. The same objective variables and objective weights were used in all plans. All the plans were produced for six planning areas (ranging from 404.6 to 984.9 ha) and 110 forest holdings (ranging from 0.6 to 449.8 ha) within these areas. The case-study results were promising: with the model presented here, the spatial structure of flying squirrel breeding and foraging areas could be improved with only minor losses in holding-level objectives. The spatial structure of the landscape after the 60-year planning period was very close to the area-level plan. This outcome was made possible by synchronizing the treatment proposals across forest-holding borders. The outcome of the model seems promising also from the practical standpoint: because the variation in the objectives of forest owners is efficiently taken into account in optimization, only rarely do the solutions suggest that the holding-level targets be compromised.

AB  - Intensified human land use continues to increase habitat loss and fragmentation, and leads to a homogenization of biodiversity. Specialized species with narrow niches seem to be declining more rapidly than generalist species. Veteran trees offer an excellent model system for testing the responses of habitat specialists vs. generalists in a changing environment, as they host a rich fauna of associated insects, with different degrees of strict habitat affinity.
   In this study, we use an extensive dataset of more than 22 000 wood-living beetles collected from 62 veteran oaks across Southern Norway, combined with a full-cover map predicting the occurrence of similar oaks in the surrounding landscape. We calculate three different connectivity measures, at eight different scales up to 25 km radius, and compare the response to patch size and patch connectivity for the specialist beetles in the veteran oak community, with that of the remaining beetle species in the community. We investigate these responses in oaks in two different surroundings; forests and parks. Our overall aim is to test whether habitat specialists and generalists respond differently to habitat patch connectivity, and if so, if differences in species traits or close surroundings can explain the response.
   We found that the specialists showed a positive response to habitat amount on a small scale (0.5 km), and this effect of small-scale connectivity was the only common factor explaining a high species richness of specialists in all models, independent of park or forest surroundings. For generalists, there was no or only a weak response to connectivity, and only at the largest scale (25 km) tested.
   The differences in response to habitat connectivity between specialists and generalists in veteran oaks can partly be explained by differences in traits, as the specialists were found to have larger body sizes, and feed on larger and more decayed dead wood material. These are all traits that have been related to increased sensitivity to forest fragmentation in earlier studies. The size and vitality of the oak, as well as the openness around it, also influenced the species richness, with different patterns between specialists and generalists and between the two types of oak surroundings.
   We conclude that increasing biotic homogenization is likely to take place with further fragmentation and loss of veteran trees, and specialist species will be the major group affected.

AB  - To enable prioritization among measures for ecological restoration, knowing the expected benefits and consequences of implementation is imperative but rarely explicitly quantified. We developed a novel method to prioritize among environmental flow measures to rehabilitate ecosystems in the Ume River catchment in northern Sweden, a river system heavily regulated for hydropower production. Our strategy was to identify measures with minimal impact on hydropower production while providing substantial environmental benefits. Based on field surveys of remaining natural values and potential for ecological rehabilitation, we quantified the projected gain in habitat area of implementing environmental flows for target organism groups, for example, lotic fish species and riparian vegetation, along the whole river length. We quantified the consequences for hydropower production by identifying a set of hydropower operational rules reflecting the constraints added by environmental flows. We then used production optimization software to calculate changes in hydropower production and revenues. Implementing restrictions on zero-flow events by mandating minimum discharge at all run-of-river hydropower stations and allocating 1%-12% of mean annual discharge to bypassed reaches in the entire catchment would result in a 2.1% loss of annual electricity production. Adding flow to fishways would increase the loss to 3.1% per year. With implementation of more natural water-level fluctuations in run-of-river impoundments, the loss increases to 3.8%. These actions would increase the habitat for lotic species like the grayling Thymallus more than threefold and increase the area of riparian vegetation by about 66%. Our method forms a basis for ongoing implementation of nationwide environmental rehabilitation schemes.

AB  - Forests provide humankind with essential raw materials and the demand for these materials is increasing. Further expanding forestry into unmanaged forests is environmentally costly and increasing forest area via plantations will not immediately lead to increased wood supply. Thus, just like in agriculture, forestry faces the challenge how to intensify forest management in existing production forests in sustainable ways. Yet, our current understanding of what determines forest management intensity is weak, particularly at broad scales, and this makes it difficult to assess the environmental and social trade-offs of intensification. Here, we analyse spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity as one indicator for forest management intensity across Europe, a region where most forests suitable for production are already in use and where future intensification is likely. To measure forest harvesting intensity, we related harvested timber volumes to net annual increment for the period 2000-2010. We used boosted regression trees to analyse the spatial determinants of forest harvesting intensity using a comprehensive set of biophysical and socioeconomic explanatory variables. Our results show that forest harvesting intensity varied markedly across Europe and harvested timber volumes were well below the increment in most regions. Harvesting intensity was especially high in southern Finland, southern Sweden, southwestern France, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity were well explained by forest-resource related variables (i.e., the share of plantation species, growing stock, forest cover), site conditions (i.e., topography, accessibility), and country-specific characteristics, whereas socioeconomic variables were less important. We also found the relationship between forest harvesting intensity and some of its predictors (e.g., share of plantation species, accessibility) to be strongly non-linear and characterised by thresholds. In summary, our study highlights candidate areas where potentials for sustainably intensifying timber production may exist. Our analyses of the spatial determinants of harvesting intensity also provides concrete starting points for developing measures targeted at increasing regional wood supply from forests or lowering harvest pressure in regions where forests are heavily used. Finally, our study emphasises the importance for systems' understanding for designing and implementing effective sustainable forest management policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to a long history of intensive land and water use, habitat networks for biodiversity conservation are generally degraded in Sweden. Landscape restoration (LR) is an important strategy for achieving representative and functional green infrastructures. However, outcomes of LR efforts are poorly studied, particularly the dynamics of LR governance and management. We apply systems thinking methods to a series of LR case studies to analyse the causal structures underlying LR governance and management in Sweden. We show that these structures appear to comprise of an interlinked system of at least three sets of drivers and four core processes. This system exhibits many characteristics of a transformative change towards an integrated, adaptive approach to governance and management. Key challenges for Swedish LR projects relate to institutional and regulatory flexibility, the timely availability of sufficient funds, and the management of learning and knowledge production processes. In response, successful project leaders develop several key strategies to manage complexity and risk, and enhance perceptions of the attractiveness of LR projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing populations of large carnivores are leading to tension and conflicts with livestock production, a situation that potentially might escalate. In Norway the objective of the large carnivore policy is two-folded: to ensure viable carnivore populations and to secure a sustainable grazing industry. The main instrument is zonation, with carnivore management zones (CMZs) prioritized for reproduction of the large carnivore species separated from other areas prioritized for grazing livestock. The objective of this paper is to describe current knowledge about the impact of the zoning management strategy on the grazing industry. This is done by documenting status and changes in sheep production, losses of livestock to predating carnivores, and the use of grazing areas inside and outside the CMZs. CMZs offering protection for lynx, wolverine, bear and wolf cover 55% of the Norwegian mainland. 30% of the sheep and 50% of the Sami reindeer grazing areas are found inside the CMZs. Livestock (semi-domestic reindeer excluded) is using 59% of the available natural pasture areas outside the CMZs, but only 26% inside the CMZs. The lowest use of available grazing areas was found inside zones for wolves (12%) and brown bears (6%). Livestock in these zones are confined to fenced enclosures, mostly on the farm itself, or moved to pastures outside the management zone for summer grazing. Livestock losses increased in the affected regions during the period when carnivores were reestablished. Later, losses declined when CMZs were established and mitigation efforts were implemented in these zones. The bulk of sheep and reindeer killed by carnivores are now found in boundary areas within 50 km off the CMZs, where sheep are still grazing on open mountain and forest ranges. Therefore, instruments to protect livestock in areas close to the CMZs are also needed. The number of sheep declined inside the CMZs from 1999 to 2014, but increased outside the zones. The reduction in the absolute number of sheep in the CMZs is balanced by a similar increase outside, thus the total sheep production in Norway is maintained. We conclude that although of little consequence for the total food production in Norway, the economic and social impact of the large carnivore management strategy can be serious for local communities and individual farmers who are affected. There is a need for more exact carnivore population monitoring to quantify the carnivore pressure, better documentation of reindeer losses, and a clearer and stricter practicing of the zoning strategy. Increased involvement of social sciences is important in order to understand the human dimension of the carnivore conflicts.

AB  - The usage history of a natural spring deposit in associated glacial till was investigated via analysis of coleopteran remains found in peat. This material was recovered during archaeological excavations in a spring outflow in south central Sweden. The geographical region of southern Sweden has been heavily affected by uplift following the terminal glaciation (Weichselian) in Scandinavia, with the study area for this project having risen above sea level about 1200 BC. The spring was found in connection to the northern part of a large settlement and religious area, dating from the Younger Bronze Age and Pre Roman Iron Age (110-300 BC). However, the area has been used for agricultural land up until the present day. Sampling was conducted for interpretation of the usage history of the site, with the insect fragments showing exceptional preservation as a result of unusual conditions in the sediments. C-14-dating from the lower to upper part of the spring yielded a stratigraphic range of 670-870 to 660-810 AD respectively. A half-circle boulder construction provides clear evidence that the spring was used early in prehistory, probably during the Bronze Age, and potentially excavated at irregular periods. The coleopteran assemblage was dominated by beetles indicative of open landscapes, grazing land, and forested environments. This closely resembles the vegetation setting of today, in which the spring is situated on the border between arable land and mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. A high frequency of carabid beetles suggests that the spring may have functioned as a pitfall trap, and correlated well with the relative inorganic to organic compound composition of the ground conditions. The spring was probably abandoned in the late Iron Age (600-800 AD). Identification of two red-listed threatened species that are not present in the current fauna implies that radical change in the agricultural landscape over the last 1200 years could be negatively affecting diversity dynamics within the local fauna.

AB  - Cities and towns have become increasingly interested in building resilience to cope with surprises, however, how to do this is often unclear. We evaluated the ability of the Resilience Assessment Workbook to help urban areas incorporate resilience thinking into their planning practice by exploring how a resilience assessment process complemented existing planning in the local government of Eskilstuna, Sweden. We conducted this evaluation using participant observation, semistructured interviews, and a survey of the participants. Our findings show that the resilience assessment contributed to ongoing planning practices by addressing sustainability challenges that were not being addressed within the normal municipal planning or operations, such as local food security. It bridged longer term sustainable development and shorter term crisis management, allowing these two sectors to develop common strategies. Our study also highlighted that the Resilience Assessment Workbook could be made more useful by providing more guidance on how to practically deal with thresholds and trade-offs across scales, as well as on how to manage transdisciplinary learning processes. This is the first in-depth study of a resilience assessment process, and it demonstrates that the Resilience Assessment Workbook is useful for planning and that it merits further research and development.

AB  - Forest policy has developed from single to multiple objectives. This requires a transition from traditional sectoral planning to more open, multi-stakeholder approaches that take into account all dimensions of sustainability across entire landscapes and even regions. Comparisons of regions with different landscape histories and governance legacies can support collaborative learning. Following Patsy Healy's and Frances Cleaver's approaches, we compare institutional strategies and constraints for collaborative territorial planning in Canada and Sweden by focusing on two case study regions in steep urban-rural gradients. Both regions are facing severe challenges after a long focus on forest staples resources. To cope with the transition towards multiple objectives, efforts towards collaborative learning inspired by the Model Forest landscape approach were made. The Canadian case study had some quick successes because of government funding, and managed to begin collaborative planning, but changes in public policy led to a quick demise. The Swedish case study developed local islands of collaborative learning, provided that champions managed to sustain their work. To conclude, we see two trajectories towards collaborative territorial planning shaped by different institutions: (1) regional level public core funding that can support planning processes top-down, or (2) establishment of voluntary local win-win solutions bottom-up. Both require committed stakeholders that are willing to employ a holistic perspective, and able to sustain resources in the long-term. However, despite a clearly stated goal towards multiple-use forest management, institutional legacies aiming at supporting maximum sustained yield wood production that have ruled the relationships between the state and the industry for so many years remain key barriers for multifunctional landscapes and regions.

AB  - The classic Scandinavian shieling consisted of a fenced site on outlying lands with meadows and structures for dwelling, stabling livestock, and processing milk. Through dismantling of rural, forested areas, competition for forest use and heritagization, shielings have been marginalized in today's agrarian life and framed as relics of an outdated system. Shieling owners, like small-scale farmers all over Europe, face challenges including economic viability, loneliness in their work, and difficulty recruiting new shieling workers. Surviving shielings (c. 200 in Sweden) are valued as local development assets and are often considered valuable for their rich biodiversity and heritage. As such, they are subject to conservation schemes that may conflict with development ambitions. Heritagization has also recently been challenged by archaeological and palaeobotanical research showing that shielings, in contrast to current relic framing, were highly adaptable to changing local economic and community conditions over almost 2,000 years. Herein, research work, community development, nature conservation, and heritage management perspectives are synthesized in a discussion of shielings' past, present, and future, with a particular focus on the shieling Karebolssatern. Based on historical findings, suggestions include promoting silvopasture and retro-innovative food production contributions to sustainable (post-)pandemic development and climate mitigation. The importance of a political ecology shift and fairer conditions for shielings, and the marginalized communities harboring them, are also highlighted.

AB  - Models used in long-term forest planning were generally, until recently, non-spatial. The locations of harvest activities were considered first in lower, more short-term steps of the planning hierarchy. However, now that issues related to biodiversity, recreation and road planning have to be considered, this is no longer a viable option. The spatial arrangement of harvest activities affects parameters such as the proportion of undisturbed interior forest and the sites of new roads. Thus, in long-term planning the spatial location of harvesting operations needs to be taken into consideration. However, including spatiality in long-term planning complicates the planning problems, and requires the development of new methods and approaches. This study presents a new approach for clustering harvest activities in time and space in long-term forest planning. The planning problem essentially consists of maximizing the weighted sum of the net present value of future forest management and the clustered volume of timber to be harvested. This objective is subject to the restriction that a certain volume should be harvested each period. Since the spatial dimension leads to a problem that is difficult to solve with ordinary optimization techniques, the ensuing problem is solved with a heuristic technique called simulated annealing. In a case study the suggested approach is applied to a landscape consisting of 2600 stands in southern Sweden. The results indicate that the model is effective for clustering the harvest and that it is possible to aggregate the harvest with only a small sacrifice of the net present value.

AB  - This modeling study presents the sectoral contributions of anthropogenic emissions in the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) on air pollution levels and the associated health impacts and costs over the Nordic and the Arctic regions for the year 2015. The Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) has been used on a 50 km resolution over Europe in tagged mode in order to calculate the response of a 30 % reduction of each emission sector in each Nordic country individually. The emission sectors considered in the study were energy production, non-industrial/commercial heating, industry, traffic, off-road mobile sources and waste management/agriculture. In total, 28 simulations were carried out. Following the air pollution modeling, the Economic Valuation of Air Pollution (EVA) model has been used to calculate the associated premature mortality and their costs. Results showed that more than 80 % of the PM2.5 concentration was attributed to transport from outside these four countries, implying an effort outside the Nordic region in order to decrease the pollutant levels over the area. The leading emission sector in each country was found to be non-industrial combustion (contributing by more than 60 % to the total PM2.5 mass coming from the country itself), except for Sweden, where industry contributed to PM2.5 with a comparable amount to non-industrial combustion. In addition to non-industrial combustion, the next most important source categories were industry, agriculture and traffic. The main chemical constituent of PM2.5 concentrations that comes from the country itself is calculated to be organic carbon in all countries, which suggested that nonindustrial wood burning was the dominant national source of pollution in the Nordic countries. We have estimated the total number of premature mortality cases due to air pollution to be around 4000 in Denmark and Sweden and around 2000 in Finland and Norway. These premature mortality cases led to a total cost of EUR 7 billion in the selected Nordic countries. The assessment of the related premature mortality and associated cost estimates suggested that non-industrial combustion, together with industry and traffic, will be the main sectors to be targeted in emission mitigation strategies in the future.

AB  - Strategy-making is key for realizing sustainable urban water management. Though general barriers and factors for change have been identified, fewer studies have assessed how different conditions influence municipalities' strategy-making ability and, thus, how to plan strategically given these conditions. Healey's strategy-making notion was applied to delimit a study of how size, finances, development path, and water organization influence Swedish municipalities' strategy-making ability for urban water. Three municipalities, Laxa, Norrkoping, and Skelleftea, with different, yet overlapping, institutional and socio-economic conditions were analyzed using semi-structured interviews, a stakeholder workshop, and document analyses. The study finds that even though key events have filtered urban water issues into the political agenda, this has not induced systemic change, except where the role of water management in urban development has been specified, i.e., has aligned dispersed planning processes. Organizational setup influences the strategy-making ability by prescribing not only when water issues are raised, but also what system perspective should be applied and what actors that should be enrolled. Judging from the three cases, size, finances, and development path do matter for strategy-making ability, but they appear to be less important than the organizational setup. Departures for improving strategy-making under different conditions are discussed.

AB  - This paper estimates and compares the costs incurred to a private landowner from establishing and managing 25-m wide biodiversity zones on field and forest margins in southern Finland. Crop and timber prices being at their long-term averages, current agricultural support paid and the real discount rate 3%, the average annual net costs per hectare of field and forest biodiversity zones were (sic)30 ha(-1) and (sic)108 ha(-1), respectively, the field zones being the less costly alternative in 95% of cases. This result is mainly due to the poor productivity of field cultivation relative to timber production under boreal climate conditions. In addition to soil quality, the initial stand structure affects the costs of both biodiversity zone types. It is less costly for a landowner to establish biodiversity zones in forests where no final felling is imminent but which already contain some tree volume. In field biodiversity zones, costs are slightly lower on fields where forest shading is great. Uneven-aged management practiced in forest biodiversity zones was found to lead to a 3-32% reduction in the net present value of forest land compared to conventional forest management. An increase in the real discount rate increases the relative efficiency of forest biodiversity zones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research work we analyse transportation volume development in major Finnish and Swedish companies using two times completed empirical survey (during years 2006 and 2009). Findings indicate that companies are identifying medium-term volume growth of container transports in Russian and Chinese markets, and partially with India. However, most of the concern is traffic imbalance, particularly developing in unwanted direction with India and China. Interestingly, Russian market, with some exceptions, is still going to be served from European factories in the medium-term too. However, in limited amount of companies it seems that Russian factories start to serve also larger European demand. As economic recession turns into Eurasian led growth during the next decade, it is questionable whether delayed investments are made in time to support further growth in trade and transport. Also large-scale usage of road transport in the forthcoming decade increases concerns about the environmental sustainability of this sector.

AB  - Environmental compensation includes a range of activities intended to counterbalance such negative impacts of development projects that remain in the environment after all preventive and corrective measures have been fully implemented. Sweden, being a member state of the European Union (EU), must implement environmental compensation under EU directives such as the Habitat Directive. However, like in other countries, implementation is not yet widespread in Sweden, and new practices and guidelines remain to be developed both nationally and at European level. This need is all the more urgent considering that the European Commission estimates that, within the EU, about 100,000 hectares of land is converted from its natural state each year.
   The aim of this paper is to describe current environmental-compensation practices in Swedish road and railway projects and to discuss issues of vital importance to the development of compensation policy, such as what to compensate for, how much, and how.
   A national inventory was performed, for the first time in Sweden, to identify compensation measures in road and railway projects. Data were collected from a national mailing list including 141 officials at county administrative boards (CABs), internal e-mail correspondence within the Swedish Transport Administration and databases of court decisions. The inventory focused on compensation measures ordered by virtue of the Swedish Environmental Code. In addition, two case studies were carried out to investigate the planning of compensation measures.
   The results showed that CABs and courts rarely order compensation in infrastructure projects, even though this is possible under Swedish law. Between 1999 and 2012, 37 cases (i.e. permits issued) were found for which compensation was ordered. Of these cases, 76% concerned compensation for encroachments on minor habitats such as small ponds and cairns. No CAB ordered compensation for non-protected areas. Compensation ratios were never explicitly mentioned in permits, but in practice a ratio of 1:1 (often measured as area or length) was usually applied. The compensation measures typically consisted in recreating the same kind of natural asset that was affected, in a location close to the damaged area. In the two cases specially studied, the road and railway planning processes were not properly adjusted to integrate compensation issues, resulting in unnecessary bureaucracy and insufficient co-ordination between different projects, such as between the environmental-impact assessment process and the compensation process or between closely related sub-projects in the same region.
   To meet the EU's goal of no net loss of biodiversity, we suggest that policy requirements should be made stricter and that incentives for voluntary compensation should be created. In line with the goals of Swedish national transport policy and the European Landscape Convention, account should be taken of social and cultural aspects, and there should be a shift from a narrow focus on individual projects to a broader planning approach, since this would allow compensation measures to be taken where they can deliver the greatest environmental benefits.

AB  - Natural disturbances are major drivers of forest dynamics. However, in the current context of anthropogenic global warming, shifts in disturbance regimes are expected. Natural disturbances usually leave biological or structural legacies which are important for early-successional species. Nevertheless, these legacies are usually eliminated by forest managers through salvage logging. Here, we investigated the consequences of forest dieback and the following salvage logging on both forest habitat conditions and saproxylic beetle communities. We conducted our study in two types of conifer-dominated highland forests: Pyrenean silver fir (Abies alba) which has suffered drought-induced dieback and Bavarian Norway spruce (Picea abies) which has suffered bark beetle-induced (Ips typographus) dieback. In both of the forest contexts, dieback provided a biological legacy through an increase in deadwood resources; however, this increase was much greater in the spruce forests. Nonetheless, despite this increase in resources, neither type of forest gained in total abundance or species richness after disturbance, compared to healthy stands. Nevertheless, the species composition of saproxylic beetle composition was significantly affected by dieback in spruce stands, but not in the silver fir forests. In the spruce plots, saproxylic beetles responded positively to the large increase in deadwood in the declining stands, including a very strong positive response from red-listed species. Saproxylic beetle assemblages in spruce forests were mainly drove by canopy openness and deadwood amount. In the silver fir plots, we did not observed responses from the saproxylic beetle communities to deadwood amount increase. This lack of response may be explained by the relatively low amount of deadwood generated by the drought-induced dieback. Concerning salvage logging, it caused stronger contrasts in spruce forests than in silver fir forests, where it generally had no significant impact. For example, in spruce forests, salvage logging reduced the density of large snags by 91% and large logs by 87% compared with unharvested declining plots. Most of the significant environmental effects on biodiversity associated with dieback were no longer significant after accounting for the salvaged plots in our study data. Then, forest dieback and salvage logging induced much sharper and stronger effects on environmental and community metrics in the spruce than in the silver fir forests. The contrast between Bavaria and the French Pyrenees seems partly related to dieback severity. Finally, we invite forest managers to conserve biological and structural legacies through patches of deadwood-rich areas.

AB  - World Heritage (WH) sites are areas for international conservation of nature and culture with outstanding universal values. The Nordic countries possess two large landscapes with WH recognition that serve as a base for this study, the WH Laponia and the WH High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago. The WH Laponia in Sweden combines both cultural and natural value; the Norwegian area of Laponia is not designated WH, but represents an area with governmental ambitions to become an UNESCO WH site. The WH High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago (Sweden/Finland) is a serial-nominated, transnational WH site designated purely on nature merits. Within these WH sites, there are local communities and indigenous peoples with democratic rights who participate in the management of the areas and use the local resources of their natural environment.This article analyses the processes of WH nomination and implementation of the WH Convention (1972) in the Nordic countries. It also depicts a strong Nordic tradition of transnational learning (TNL) which is also used within WH governance. The article uses comparative methods and theories of governance, co-management, transnational governance and TNL in the analysis of the transboundary WH sites. The empirical results illustrate the challenges of local democratic participation in the national and transnational decision-making regarding nomination and implementation of the WH Convention. It suggests that deficiency of democratic participation during early stages in pre-WH designation processes may be compensated by TNL. Learning between and within WH-related networks and groups, show in the Nordic perspective examples of incorporating WH stakeholders in cooperation across national borders. TNL may be restricted by cultural and legal limitations.

AB  - There are several obstacles to establish tourism governance policies in a border area and to improve the conceptualization of tourism in border territories transcending the transnational level, using territorial delimitation at Euroregional level. At borders, tourism usually works as a strategic policy tool to strengthen the regional image, shape common identity narratives and facilitate interactions, becoming these regions, nowadays, challenges for the actors of the territory, representing a priority area for the application of territorial development strategies at local level and at the level of the European Union itself. A qualitative analysis was based on performed semistructured interviews with key tourism stakeholders. From the interviewee perspective, cooperation should be achieved through cooperation agreements between the business sector and economic agents to develop natural, cultural and heritage resources.

AB  - Reconstructions of past land use and related land-cover changes at local and regional scales are needed to evaluate the potential long-term impacts of land use on the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. In this purpose, we selected the Gamleby area at the Swedish Baltic Sea coast for a case study. We use a new, high resolution pollen record from a small lake (Lillsjon) located 3.6 km NNW of the bay Gamlebyviken and detailed analysis of the available archeological data to reconstruct local land-use changes over the last 3000 years. To estimate land-cover change at local (2-3 km radius area) and regional (50 km radius area) scales we use four additional, published pollen records from two small and two large lakes (25-70 km S of Lillsjon) and the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm, a pollen-vegetation modeling scheme. Results show that regional and local (small lakes Lillsjon and Hyttegol) land-cover changes are comparable over the last 1500 years (Late Iron Age to present), and that landscape openness was much larger locally than regionally (difference of 20-40% cover over the last 500 years). The periods of largest potential impacts on the Gamlebyviken Bay from regional and local land use are 200-950 CE (Late Iron Age) and 1450 CE to present, and of lowest potential impacts 950-1450 CE. The question on whether the large landscape openness 1150-50 BCE and significant afforestation 50 BCE-200 CE reconstructed for Lillsjon's area are characteristic of the Gamlebyviken region will require additional pollen records in the catchment area.

AB  - This study identifies and analyses multiple factors that impact people's interactions with urban greenspace in Sweden. An unrestricted, self-selected online survey was used to collect the data. The survey questions were related to individual characteristics of respondents, including socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported nature connectedness, and self-reported constraints to greenspace usage; perceived characteristics of urban greenspace, including its availability, quality, and accessibility, and benefits and problems; and preferences of respondents regarding types of urban greenspace and activities. Additionally, several spatially explicit variables were included in the analysis. A total of 2806 respondents from 208 (of 290) municipalities completed the survey. Our findings indicate that greenspace users are highly heterogeneous and utilise diverse green spaces along the urban-peri-urban gradient for various benefits. The statistical analyses identified 61 explanatory variables that affect the frequency of interactions with urban greenspace. In addition, we identify key factors that shape critical differences between frequent and infrequent urban users, such as nature connectedness, perceptions of urban greenspace functions, and their perceived accessibility. Our results highlight the complex challenge facing urban planners and managers of green spaces, who have to consider and integrate a vast array of factors influencing the willingness of increasingly diverse urban populations to interact with greenspace.

AB  - Some golf courses start off as half-size, 9-hole courses and, if successful, expand in area to full-size courses, thus converting more land to highly managed greenspace. We investigated carabid beetle assemblages in three established and newly created suburban golf courses in Helsinki, southern Finland. Beetles were collected from similar habitat types on established courses, newly created courses and nearby reference areas. Seventy-one carabid beetle species were collected and the beetle assemblages were dominated by open habitat and generalist species. Assemblages differed considerably between the three golf courses studied and between the habitat types sampled, but not between course development stages (established vs. newly created) or reference areas. We argue that some carabid beetle species in the urban landscape in Helsinki are resilient and capable of rapidly colonising these modified environments. Under current management regimes, these golf courses in Helsinki, Finland, do not host carabid beetles of conservation concern, yet are rich in generalist and open habitat species.

AB  - Loss and fragmentation of semi-natural grasslands have had negative consequences for grassland biodiversity, such as butterflies. Urban parks and other urban green spaces have so far largely been overlooked as suitable butterfly habitats, although they could potentially sustain diverse butterfly populations over time. We analysed the temporal change in butterfly species assemblages in urban green spaces in the city of Malmo, Southern Sweden. We studied changes in species richness and abundance of butterflies between 2006 and 2015 in 20 public urban green spaces, characterized by different management regimes. We sampled butterflies in traditional parks with intense grass cutting regimes, in semi-natural grasslands mowed only a few times per year, and in un-managed or irregularly managed ruderal sites. We found a slight increase in the total number of butterfly species in the study area, but a general decline in local species numbers in urban green spaces. Traditional urban parks had the greatest loss of species over time, and altogether the lowest number of species. In contrast, semi-natural parks and ruderal sites had higher numbers of butterfly species and also lost fewer species over time. Our study shows that intensive management strategies in urban green spaces have a negative impact on butterfly assemblages over time. We suggest that less intensive management strategies can be used to create high-quality areas for flower-visiting insects in urban green spaces, possibly in combination with planting larval host plant species, depending on the park type and design.

AB  - In the EU, including Sweden, organic farming is seen as a promising pathway for sustainable production, protecting human health and animal welfare, and conserving the environment. Despite positive developments in recent decades, expanding organic farming to the Swedish national target of 30% of farmland under organic production remains challenging. In this study, we developed two scenarios to evaluate the role of organic farming in the broader context of Swedish food systems: (i) baseline trend scenario (Base), and (ii) sustainable food system scenario (Sust). Base describes a future where organic farming is implemented alongside the current consumption, production and waste patterns, while Sust describes a future where organic farming is implemented alongside a range of sustainable food system initiatives. These scenarios are coupled with several variants of organic area: (i) current 20% organic area, (ii) the national target of 30% organic area by 2030, and (iii) 50% organic area by 2050 for Sust. We applied the 'FABLE (Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-use and Energy) Calculator' to assess the evolution of the Swedish food system from 2000 to 2050 and evaluate land use, emissions and self-sufficiency impacts under these scenarios. Our findings show that expanding organic farming in the Base scenarios increases the use of cropland and agricultural emissions by 2050 compared to the 2010 reference year. However, cropland use and emissions are reduced in the Sust scenario, due to dietary changes, reduction of food waste and improved agricultural productivity. This implies that there is room for organic farming and the benefits it provides, e.g. the use of fewer inputs and improved animal welfare in a sustainable food system. However, changing towards organic agriculture is only of advantage when combined with transformative strategies to promote environmental sustainability across multiple sections, such as changed consumption, better production and food waste practices.

AB  - Wind energy can harm birds through collision mortality, displacement, barrier to movements, and habitat loss or degradation with largely unknown consequences for their populations. Impact avoidance via appropriate site selection is the most effective means for preventing or alleviating damage from wind energy. Appropriate site selection requires a knowledge of landscape priorities. Here, we used a Spatial Conservation Prioritisation software to identify priority areas for bird conservation in relation to onshore wind energy in Finland, providing spatial guidance for impact avoidance at the national level. We showed that high bird priority areas are mainly concentrated in coastal and adjacent areas, thus entailing marked regional differences and responsibilities. Only a fraction of high priority areas (e.g., 15 % of 10 % top priority areas) is under some level of protection, indi-cating that the network of protected areas should be expanded to safeguard sensitive species. We found that the west coast, in particular, concentrates potential conflicts between birds and wind energy due to the co -occurrence of high priority areas and extensive wind energy development regionally. Thus, focusing conserva-tion action away from areas already extensively targeted by wind energy cannot meet the conservation needs of many sensitive species, some of which occur exclusively or mainly in coastal areas. We recommend that birds be protected by avoiding construction in high priority areas and conducting careful spatial planning in coastal and potentially high conflict areas. Our results can contribute to bird conservation schemes, while addressing the pressing issue of biodiversity protection in the context of energy transition.

AB  - The ecological impacts of roads and railways extend into the surrounding landscape, leading to habitat degradation and reduced wildlife densities within an area that is considerably larger than the actual road or railway corridor. For birds, an extensive meta-analysis has identified an average of 20% density reduction within 1 km from the infrastructure. I investigated to what extent this density reduction can be expected to compromise the habitat quality and conservation value of Swedish Natura 2000 areas designated for the protection of birds (Special Protection Areas; SPAs). The majority (63%) of Swedish SPAs are, to some extent, found within this 1 km road/railway effect zone (REZ). The total overlap between SPA and REZ is approximately 126,000 ha or 4.2% of the country's SPA area. There are, however, large differences amongst bio-geographical regions. In the southern (continental) and coastal regions combined, 25.8% of the total SPA area fall within REZ, representing an estimated 4-7% reduction in bird abundance within SPAs. The probability of overlap with REZ is higher for larger SPAs. However, the proportion of overlap is higher for smaller SPAs and, accordingly, smaller sites can be assumed to experience a greater impact from transport infrastructure and traffic. The impacts on Natura 2000 sites are particularly concerning as this network of protected areas is a cornerstone for maintenance and restoration of biodiversity within the EU. I recommend placing a stronger emphasis in the management of Natura 2000 sites on the threats to wildlife conservation caused by transport infrastructure and traffic. Special attention should be paid to sites with a large overlap with the REZ and sites hosting particularly vulnerable taxa or habitats. Infrastructure owners and managers should make their best efforts to minimise and compensate for the negative impacts of roads and railways and associated traffic in SPAs and other protected areas.

AB  - When many environmental changes take place simultaneously, one of the first challenges for conservation efforts is to identify the species and environments that are in the most need of conservation measures. We studied whether there are differences in the population growth trends of 94 boreal bird species according to their migration strategies, breeding distributions (northern or southern), or breeding habitats. To this end, we examined recent trends in bird census data covering >1000 km along a north-south transect in Finland, from the deciduous forests on the southern coast through the boreal taiga forest to the alpine fell area in the north. Our results show that long-distance migrants (species wintering in western or eastern Africa or Asia), northern species, and species living in agricultural environments are in decline in north-eastern Europe. The results were the same for both the long-term (27 years; 19862012) and the short-term (12 years, the most recent reporting period of the EU bird directive; 20012012) data set. Additionally, species breeding mainly in urban/sub-urban environments, coniferous forests, or wetlands showed negative growth trends, especially over the short-term. These results provide updated information that can be used to determine the targets of conservation efforts focused on Northern Palaearctic birds. Several different conservation measures may be needed to help these populations, ranging from protecting habitat in the migration and wintering grounds to changing climate and agricultural policies at a national and/or international level. In addition, further research is needed to identify the particular mechanisms underlying the population trends. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Preserving streamside forest habitats or buffer strips is considered to reduce forestry-related biodiversity loss in commercial forest landscapes. However, it is still unclear what type of management in and near streamside forests can be undertaken without compromising their biodiversity and natural change through succession. Using a before-after, control-impact study design, we tested the impacts of forested buffer strips (15 or 30 m wide, with or without selective logging), preserved after clear-cutting, on the changes of polypore communities in streamside boreal forests in Finland. Manipulations in 28 sites produced four treatment classes, the community compositions of which were compared with seven unmanaged controls before and 12 years after the manipulations. The polypore community composition in 15 in wide buffer strips changed differently than that in controls and resembled the community composition typically found in production forests. Moreover, selective logging tended to homogenize polypore communities. These responses of polypore communities indicate that the natural biodiversity and succession of streamside forests was disturbed in both 15 m wide and selectively logged buffer strips. Streamside forests in nonlogged 30 in wide buffer strips seemed to retain the natural polypore community composition and succession, at least during the 12-year period.

AB  - Passive rewildening of forest ecosystems is commonly used for rehabilitating degraded habitats closer to their natural origin in addition to costly active restoration measures. However, it is not clear if passive processes are effective and how long the recovery of main ecosystem properties takes. We investigate the recovery of forest soil and tree stand characteristics a century after cessation of slash-and-burn cultivation, a major historical intensive disturbance regime that was applied widely in boreal zone of Finland until late 1800s. We systematically sampled soil and tree stand parameters within former slash-and-burn and nearby control areas. Humus layer thickness and soil organic matter (SOM) stocks were still lower in the historical slash-and-burn than in control areas. Slash-and-burn areas also had a larger volume of live birch trees and a higher standing dead wood volume than control areas. Accordingly, organic matter (humus layer thickness and SOM stocks) correlated negatively with birch standing live tree volume. Combined OM stock in humus and uppermost 10 cm mineral soil layer was positively correlated with lying dead wood volume. Overall, we observed clear recovery of several natural properties but we also found that a century after cessation of frequent anthropogenic burnings, clear legacies of disturbance in the above-and below-ground parts of boreal ecosystem were evident. Our results indicate that if only passive rewildening is applied as a restoration measure, the full recovery of boreal forest is slow and the effects of historical land-use may persist for over hundred years in soil and tree properties.

AB  - Social learning, especially triple-loop social learning involving institutional and governance changes, has great potential to address urban water issues such as flooding, drought, and pollution. It facilitates urban transition and the adoption of more systemic approaches and innovations. Social learning in water governance is a growing field, but the triple-loop learning concept remains vague and underexplored. Additionally, the focus is often on how social learning can contribute to progress with little attention being paid to barriers to learning. The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of triple-loop social learning to improve the "learning infrastructure". It investigates key learning barriers for realizing green (livable) and adaptive cities in Malmo and Gothenburg, Sweden. Integration of nature-based solutions in spatial planning and development of these cities has been slow. The results found three types of barriers contributing to this: systemic (disconnecting parts with the whole); opacity (reducing communication between error detection and correction); and process-related (reducing the adoption of innovations). The paper contributes to understanding the social learning barriers for implementing planning. These insights could help overcome "adaptation inertia" and speed up policy learning towards sustainability and resilience.

AB  - QuestionsWhat factors control broad-scale variation in edge length and three-dimensional boundary structure for a large region extending across two biomes? What is the difference in structure between natural and anthropogenic edges?
   LocationTemperate and boreal forests across all of Sweden, spanning latitudes 55-69 degrees N.
   MethodsWe sampled more than 2000 forest edges using line intersect sampling in a monitoring programme (National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden). We compared edge length, ecosystem attributes (width of adjacent ecosystem, canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast in canopy height, forest type) and boundary attributes (profile, abruptness, shape) of natural edges (lakeshore, wetland) with anthropogenic edges (clear-cut, agricultural, linear disturbance) in five regions.
   ResultsAnthropogenic edges were nearly twice as abundant as natural edges. Length of anthropogenic edges was largest in southern regions, while the abundance of natural edges increased towards the north. Edge types displayed unique spectrums of boundary structures, but abrupt edges dominated, constituting 72% of edge length. Anthropogenic edges were more abrupt than natural edges; wetland edges had the most gradual and sinuous boundaries. Canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast and forest type depended on region, whereas overall boundary abruptness and shape showed no regional pattern. Patch contrast was related to temperature sum (degree days5 degrees C), suggesting that regional variability can be predicted from climate-controlled forest productivity. Boundary abruptness was coupled with the underlying environmental gradient, land use and forest type, with higher variability in deciduous than in conifer forest.
   ConclusionsEdge origin, land use, climate and tree species are main drivers of broad-scale variability in forest edge structure. Our findings have important implications for developing ecological theory that can explain and predict how different factors affect forest edge structure, and help to understand how land use and climate change affect biodiversity at forest edges.

AB  - Management of ecosystems often focuses on specific species chosen for their habitat demand, public appeal, or levels of threat. We propose a complementary framework for choosing focal species, the mobile link concept, which allows managers to focus on spatial processes and deal with multi-scale ecological dynamics. Spatial processes are important for three reasons: maintenance, re-organization, and restoration of ecological values. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Identifying and managing mobile links is a way to align management with the ecologically relevant scales in any landscape.

AB  - Impacts of wind power on bats are usually evidenced by the recorded fatalities, while other impacts are not well understood or considered during project planning. However, wind turbines may affect use of the surrounding habitats by bats. Little is known about such impact, especially in the European boreal biogeographical region. We studied the consequences of operating wind turbines on the presence and activity of bats in forests. We simultaneously monitored bat acoustic activity at 84 sampling sites placed at 200 m intervals from 0 to 1.000 m (2 recorders per distance class), over four months and at seven Finnish wind farms located in forested habitats. Our results show higher presence and activity at 600 m and further from turbines for Eptesicus nilssonii, and higher presence at 800 m and further for Myotis spp. We also saw an increase in bat activity during midsummer, which may be due to increased use of forest canopy cover during the short nights at this time. These results indicate a potential loss in habitat quality around wind turbines, e.g., a greater number of open areas in forests unfavourable to certain bat species. This lower activity and presence could also be an indication for active avoidance of the wind turbines from the bats. Furthermore, these results are the first of their kind for Eptesicus nilssonii, and for the European boreal biogeographical region. They show undeniable impacts of wind power on bats in Finland, and enforce the requirement for better consideration of bats during the development of such projects in Finland. Similarly, these results show impacts of operating turbines on habitat use by bats, impacts that now must be considered in Europe. We also call for investigation on the causative mechanisms of the observed effect, to better facilitate mitigation.

AB  - Wildflower areas are a popular agri-environment scheme to counteract agro-biodiversity loss. Yet, their benefits are controversially discussed. Since inconsistent benefits may be owed to landscape context and temporal dynamics, we applied a multiyear study to unravel effects of permanent and transient habitats on ground-dwelling arthropods in wildflower areas and cereal fields.
   Across three consecutive years, we studied activity density, species richness and community composition of rove beetles, carabid beetles and spiders in ten pairs of wildflower areas and cereal fields along independent gradients of proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats or transient wildflower areas.
   Arthropod responses to the proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats often followed a hump-shaped pattern, whereas transient wildflower areas seemed to drive linear responses. An interactive effect on rove beetle richness in wildflower areas implies that benefits were highest either at intermediate proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats or at lower proportions, but with additional availability of transient wildflower areas or in landscapes with low proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats, but high proportions of wildflower areas. However, ground-dwelling arthropod activity density or species richness did not systematically increase over the three study years.
   Our results suggest that both permanent and transient habitats differ in how they affect biodiversity, possibly due to different temporal continuity and resource diversity. Benefits of permanent semi-natural habitats seemed highest at an equilibrium between an increasing resource-related species pool and an increasing diversity dilution, whereas benefits of transient wildflower areas seemed to increase with resource complementarity and connectivity at the landscape scale. Nevertheless, both habitats seem to complement each other and considered in concert, seem to be most effective in promoting benefits of wildflower areas to ground-dwelling arthropods at intermediate landscape complexity. The substantial variation in diversity patterns among years with weather extremes, suggests that optimizing benefits of wildflower areas requires further multi-year studies. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Integrating biodiversity conservation into forest management requires changes in the practices of those public and private actors that have implementing responsibilities and whose strategic and operational opportunities are at stake. Understanding this kind of context-dependent institutional adaptation entails bridging between two analytical approaches: policy implementation and organizational adaptation. This article combines these two approaches by reviewing them, and their caveats, and by summarizing empirical analyses of organizational competences. specialization, professional judgment, and organizational networks in the organizational field of non-industrial private forestry in Finland. Drawing on these theoretical and empirical analyses, the article discloses the broad phenomenon of institutional adaptation in the integration of biodiversity conservation and forest management. The empirical analyses point to the dominance of hierarchical policy implementation over strategic organizational adaptation. Together with the detected isomorphism of professional norms and networks, these contribute to meeting minimum standards but can constrain the ways in which the organizations and professionals respond to the challenge of biodiversity conservation. The detected inertia signals lack of alertness. It is perhaps also an indication of self-sufficiency among the actors. The interpretation of these responses to challenges and responsibilities across the public and private sector boundaries demonstrates the necessity of combining the two traditionally segregated approaches.

AB  - Population increases and environmental degradation are challenges for urban sustainability. Planning support systems are available to assist local authorities in developing strategies toward sustainability and resilience of urban areas, but are not always used in practice. We adapted an open-source planning support system to the case of Stockholm County, Sweden, where there is a productive working relationship between researchers, city planners, and regional planners. We employed a collaborative approach in extending and updating the planning support system and analyzed the outcomes, in order to both improve the planning support system and to investigate the process of planner engagement in planning support system development. The approach involved systematic interactions with local planning authorities and e.g. additional data processing, integrating scientific knowledge, policy, and engagement by planners in the complex process of planning for sustainable urban development. This made the planning support system more user-friendly for local planners, facilitating adoption by planning authorities through overcoming common quality and acceptance barriers to the use of planning support system in practice. Involving planners in planning support system development thus increases (i) planning support system quality, producing relevant and up-to-date outputs, and (ii) acceptance for planning support system by regional planners. Further assessment is required to determine whether planners can operate the adapted planning support system unaided.

AB  - Habitat loss is considered a major threat for biodiversity. However, the scales on which its effects occur are still insufficiently understood, namely, is the amount of available habitat important for species richness on both local and landscape scales? We studied the effects of local and landscape-scale habitat amount on local-scale species density of deadwood-dependent lichens in Swedish boreal forests. Creation and retention of deadwood are common practices to benefit forest biodiversity, and recognizing the relevant scale is critical for them to be successful.We surveyed deadwood-dependent lichens in 90 unmanaged forest stands that differed in the local and landscape habitat amount. The local habitat amount was measured as the amount of deadwood in the sampled stands (m(2) deadwood ha(-1)), while six alternative proxies were used to estimate the landscape habitat amount, that is, the amount of deadwood in the surrounding landscapes. Lichen species density (number of species per standardized deadwood area of 3.7 m(2)) was modelled as a function of local and landscape habitat amount at multiple scales (300 m-5 km from the stands).Lichen species density increased with the landscape habitat amount. The proportion of old forests (>100 years, including newly clear-cut stands that until recently were old forests) within 5 km from the stands explained species density better than the other proxies of landscape habitat amount. Local deadwood amount did not affect species density, and there was no interaction between the local and landscape habitat amount.Synthesis and applications: To promote the conservation of deadwood-dependent lichens, the amount of old forests in managed forest landscapes should be maintained or increased. A certain amount of deadwood hosted more lichen species when situated in a landscape with more old forest, while there was no effect of the local deadwood amount. This suggests that management aimed at increasing the local species density of deadwood-dwelling lichens should focus on creating and maintaining habitat in the surrounding landscape rather than only adding deadwood to that local site. In other words, effective management for deadwood-dependent lichen diversity requires landscape-scale habitat protection.

AB  - The Swedish North is sometimes described as a resource periphery, while others choose to label it a pleasure periphery. Regardless of the terms used, the region is characterised by problems such as out-migration and demographic issues. This study investigates why there are such different perceptions of the same area, and whether there is any contradiction between extractive resource industries and the tourism industry. This is done by collecting visitor data from mining companies and conducting interviews with a variety of respondents in three mining communities in northern Sweden. Mining tourism is a phenomenon occurring in this region and can be regarded as a context in which the two main narratives meet while being a rather overlooked form of tourism. This is partly due to the low level of knowledge regarding its impacts, but also to a somewhat established idea of mining tourism as a "bad" form of tourism. Individuals' perceptions of mining tourism as a phenomenon seem to be highly value-related and influenced by both location and occupation. As such, various opinions can be explained by social exchange theory, which proposes that attitudes will be influenced by individuals' evaluation of outcomes for themselves and their community. In this paper, the emergence of mining tourism is understood as knowledge creation rooted in a regional path dependency on mining and tourism. Hence, mining tourism becomes a new regional tourism product that contributes to tourism, at least in terms of standard technical visits and, at best, a well-developed tourist attraction that appeals to visitors in quantities similar to iconic regional attractions such as the Icehotel. Then again, a tourism industry selling dreams of "untouched nature" argues that this tourism product produces "bad imaging".

AB  - Efficiency in agricultural food production has long been in focus and this has affected the spatial structure of agricultural land use. One outcome has been extensive criticism based on a wide range of negative consequences, such as for biodiversity, accessibility, cultural heritage, and aesthetics. In line with the European Landscape Convention (ELC), management of people's everyday landscapes is important. In Norway, agricultural landscapes are the 'everyday landscape' for a large proportion of the population. The aim of the article is to contribute to the understanding of landscape changes perceived as positive or negative by the inhabitants. The authors focused on grain-crop dominated landscapes and the impact of smaller non-crop elements on people's landscape preferences. They administered a photo-based questionnaire using manipulated photos to assess preferences for different agricultural landscapes. Additionally, people's perceived objectives for the agricultural sector and agriculture's primary functions were assessed. The results documented positive perceptions of added landscape elements and that people were both aware of and agreed on the multifunctional role of agriculture. The authors conclude that if the public's preferences are to be taken into consideration, such as during policymaking, it is important to maintain various landscape elements in the large-scale grain field landscapes of Norway.

AB  - Sweden's forest policy was fundamentally changed in 1993. Timber production and maintenance of biodiversity then became objectives of equal dignity. In the past, timber production had been the single primary aim of Swedish forest policy. The strategy established for maintaining biodiversity is based on a system of forest reserves and management of the matrix that mimics natural processes and builds in natural structures at the stand and, when applicable, the landscape level. One reason for not basing the strategy on reserves only is that almost ail Swedish forests have been intensively managed and, as a consequence, there is a shortage of areas suitable for reserves. The new forest policy presupposes a consensus in the forestry sector of the importance of maintaining biodiversity. Training and information are as important as legislation. Maintenance of biodiversity is not an operative goal. This makes it difficult to predict the outcome of the policy and, consequently, there is a need for monitoring routines to enable changes to policy implementation. Such routines have yet to be developed.

AB  - We sought to determine the outcomes of 25 years of implementation of the plan for the elimination of the black locust from Warsaw's Biela ' nski Forest. Forty years was the planned duration of the work to eradicate the nonnative species, through the removing of individual trees from stands, repeated every 8-10 years. We presumed that the effects of these silvicultural treatments were positive if during the 1992-2017 study period, it would be possible to note declines: in density (number of individuals per hectare) of black locust trees (even as density of maple trees increased); in the abundance of saplings of the species (as opposed to maple); and in the rate of advancement of the species from the low to the 'high sapling' layers (again as opposed to maple). Empirical data were collected from 29 permanent sampling plots every five years. However, just 7 years into the eradication effort, 1999 brought protests from people living close to the Forest, who were left uninformed about the intention to fell black locust trees. These protests proved so effective that they resulted in an almost-complete abandonment of the relevant silvicultural measures. Thus, 25 years on, the conservation goal set for the Forest had only been achieved in part, as the decrease in density of black locust trees in the forest observed for 1992-1997 was followed by a slower process of decline that by definition reflected natural processes, rather than the now abandoned tree-felling measures. Furthermore, black locust trees were able to continue their advance up from the 'low sapling' to 'high sapling' layers. The 1999 event thus emphasised, not only the need to secure the participation and understanding of a local community in regard to forest management; but also the requirement that people be educated about their area's valuable natural attributes, and about the need for nature conservation measures in general.

AB  - The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus is widely accepted as a species seriously suffering from fragmentation of forests and habitat loss. Foresters as well as conservationists agree on the need and principles for maintaining viable populations, but the proposed management means often differ. The approach currently favoured by Finnish foresters is to manage capercaillie leks and their surroundings using methods that differ from those used in intensive forestry. It may be desirable to prove that forests with capercaillie leks also favour other forest bird species and biodiversity in general. During the last 16 years (1987-2002), forest birds have been censused and capercaillie leks were mapped in the 465-km(2) study area in southern Finland. Most of the study area consists of spruce-dominated mature forests. The remainder of the landscape is a mixture of variously aged forests, agricultural areas, lakes and scattered human settlements with a gradient from an agricultural-forest mosaic to forest-dominated areas. The old-growth forest bird species three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus, pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum and red-breasted flycatcher Ficedula parva were more abundant within 300 m and 1,000 m radii around capercaillie lek sites than in non-lek control sites. Also the overall species richness of breeding forest birds was higher in the vicinity of capercaillie leks. On a larger scale (100 x 100 km squares), using the wildlife triangle scheme developed in Finland, we show that the density of capercaillie closely coincides with a wildlife richness index describing the total abundance of 15 other forest-dwelling mammal and bird species with diverse ecology and habitat requirements. Capercaillie is a flagship species for foresters, and can be considered a good candidate for an umbrella species for wildlife in taiga forests.

AB  - In 2008, the Swedish government launched an inquiry into the possibilities, benefits and requirements for conducting intensive forestry in part of the Swedish countryside, including fertilization, genetically improved plant material and fast-growing species beyond what is currently allowed in Swedish legislation. Drawing upon part of that governmental investigation, this paper analyzes attitudes toward intensive forestry over time. The study draws upon studies of points of conflict written in the 1970s and 1980s, attitudes among different stakeholder groups, and interviews with forest owners and stakeholder groups potentially affected by intensive forestry. The study concludes that the diverging opinions as to what constitutes acceptable forest use have remained largely the same over the years. Radical landscape change is generally not seen as desirable, but views diverge over the use of novel tree species and the use of fertilization.

AB  - The present research aims to evaluate deforestation and strategies to reduce the deterioration of Amazonian forests. Peru has a considerable area of forest cover, by the year 2020 during the pandemic the Peruvian Amazon suffered a significant loss of forest cover due to deforestation, which aggravates floods, droughts and landslides, products of climate change, the expansion of agriculture and livestock, mining, road construction and population growth, among others, are activities that promote deforestation. The technique used is the bibliographic review of different documents produced in public and private institutions related to the subject, also the Joint Declaration of Intent (DCI) is a scheme of economic incentives to combat deforestation and forest degradation, which has the cooperation of Peru, Norway, and Germany, which was raised in three phases: Phase I: Preparation; Phase II: Transformation and Phase III: Payment for results; in October 2018 the implementation plan of Phase II was completed. The agreement that has been extended until 2025.

AB  - After centuries of intense persecution, several large carnivore species in Europe and North America have experienced a rebound. Today's spatial configuration of large carnivore populations has likely arisen from the interplay between their ecological traits and current environmental conditions, but also from their history of persecution and protection. Yet, due to the challenge of studying population-level phenomena, we are rarely able to disentangle and quantify the influence of past and present factors driving the distribution and density of these controversial species. Using spatial capture-recapture models and a data set of 742 genetically identified wolverines Gulo gulo collected over 1/2 million km(2) across their entire range in Norway and Sweden, we identify landscape-level factors explaining the current population density of wolverines in the Scandinavian Peninsula. Distance from the relict range along the Swedish-Norwegian border, where the wolverine population survived a long history of persecution, remains a key determinant of wolverine density today. However, regional differences in management and environmental conditions also played an important role in shaping spatial patterns in present-day wolverine density. Specifically, we found evidence of slower recolonization in areas that had set lower wolverine population goals in terms of the desired number of annual reproductions. Management of transboundary large carnivore populations at biologically relevant scales may be inhibited by administrative fragmentation. Yet, as our study shows, population-level monitoring is an achievable prerequisite for a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and density of large carnivores across an increasingly anthropogenic landscape.

AB  - With an expected increase in urbanisation and low-carbon transition efforts, the planning of cities is becoming more challenging, and societies need to rethink how urban infrastructures will be constructed in the future. There is a growing recognition that the use of space below the city will need to be significantly enhanced. However, once transformed, underground space becomes a permanent feature, and major metropolitan areas worldwide are gradually acknowledging the subsurface as a valuable, non-renewable resource, emphasising the necessity for long-term, comprehensive, and sustainable planning of its utilisation. Sweden, including the Stockholm region, has favourable geological conditions for building underground facilities and a long tradition of subsurface en-gineering. Despite these advantages, Stockholm lacks a comprehensive, long-term underground plan or strategy. For years, major subsurface projects have been driven by short-term needs, potentially hindering the optimal use of space below the cityscape. The overall purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we explore the nascent area of scholarly work concerned with the case of Stockholm's subsurface. We do so by evaluating the current status and potential of urban underground planning in Stockholm municipality. Second, we seek to advance existing planning knowledge and practices concerning Stockholm's subsurface by identifying several distinct but inter-related gaps and challenges that impede the immediate integration of urban underground space into strategic decision-making for the future of underground planning in Stockholm. We suggest that further research is necessary in several key areas to facilitate the effectiveness and sustainability of long-term urban underground use and planning in Stockholm City and its metropolitan area.

AB  - While the impact of the geographic conditions of cross border regions on learning processes have recently attracted attention, the potential contribution of tourism and its mobilities to facilitating innovative processes in cross border regions has been ignored. The paper examines the role of tourism knowledge transfer and innovation in the context of European cross border regional innovation systems. It questions whether intensive movement of people, across relatively open international borders, influences knowledge transfer and diffusion of innovations. A conceptual framework including aspects related to mobility, connectivity, internationalisation, socio-cultural proximity and governance dimensions is suggested for future research studies. The paper highlights possible implications for EU cross border regional funded initiatives and policies.

AB  - Forests contribute to numerous ecosystem functions and services and contain a large proportion of terrestrial biodiversity, but they are being negatively impaced by anthropogenic activities. Forests that have never been clear-cut and have old growth characteristics, termed "near-natural," often harbor different and richer species assemblages than managed forests. Alternative management strategies may be able to balance the needs of biodiversity with the demands of forestry, but evaluation efforts are limited by the challenges of measuring biodiversity. Species richness is frequently used as a simple measure of biodiversity, but research indicates that it may not adequately capture community-level changes. Alternatively, trait-based measures of biodiversity may prove to be useful, but research is lacking. In this paper, we use a large dataset that includes 339 obligate saproxylic beetle species collected over a decade in the boreal region throughout southern Norway to: (1) establish if there is a difference in beetle community composition between near-natural and managed forests; and (2) determine which measures of beetle biodiversity best indicate forest naturalness. We arranged the sites in an ordination space and tested for differences in community composition between these forest types. We also tested different measures of biodiversity to determine which were the most predictive of forest naturalness. We found a clear difference in community composition between near-natural and managed forests. Additionally, three measures of biodiversity were most predictive of forest naturalness: proportional abundance of predators, community weighted mean (CWM) of wing length, and CWM of body roundness. The probability that a forest was near-natural increased with the proportional abundance of predators but decreased with CWM wing length and body roundness. Although species richness was higher in near-natural forests, the effect was not significant. Overall, our findings underscore the conservation value of near-natural forests and highlight the potential of several measures of biodiversity for determining forest quality.

AB  - Within the now extensive recent literature on cultures of nature, agriculture has received less attention than might have been expected given its threshold role in transforming human relations with the earth and with plants and animals. The concept and practice of agriculture can be understood as central to the emergence and maintenance of the culture/nature dichotomy within Western thought and practice. In this paper we use the comparative cases of Sweden and Australia to examine the differential and contingent positioning of agriculture with respect to that which is understood as nature. Broadly speaking, some parts of agriculture are understood to belong to nature in Sweden through a long history. This is not the case in Australia, where the short agricultural history is positioned in contrast to nature. This affects the way in which biodiversity and environmental protection takes place in Sweden as part of farming, in Australia in spite of it. We argue that these cultural differences have been more important than generally recognised in debates over multifunctional agriculture. We discuss the environmental management implications of the two different models in a context made more dynamic by climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines institutional conditions for local governance and environmental integration. Four eco-city cases in Sweden and China are analyzed. The theoretical framework is based on theories of Environmental Policy Integration (EPI) and sustainable urban planning. Three categories of institutional conditions guide the analysis: Political will and commitment, Understanding, knowledge and experience, and Inter-organizational coordination. Despite strong local political will and commitment, considerable obstacles to environmental integration still exist, including political instability, lack of understanding, knowledge and experience, and insufficient cross-sector coordination. The current administrative organization based on sector-specific responsibility appears to impede cross-sector coordination for integrating environmental concerns in urban development. The establishment of temporary local administrative organizations may be an effective solution to break cross-sector barriers and generate integrated solutions to realize environmental objectives.

AB  - Recent debates regarding urban policy mobilities have shed light on the transfer and adaptation of similar sets of measures and projects. However, limited attention has been given to the local decision-making processes and to how democratic or autocratic modes of governance affect the adaptation. This paper focuses on the transnational spreading of brand museums and cultural institutions as part of leisure-and-tourism-oriented urban regeneration strategies. The Guggenheim Foundation has been most active in this regard since the late 1990s with the Bilbao narrative de-contextualised and circulating internationally, luring new localities to establish the museum. The paper compares two fairly similar Guggenheim museum initiatives in situations differing radically in political and planning terms in Abu Dhabi, UAE and Helsinki, Finland - respectively, the capital of a sheikdom and the capital of a democratic country - asking what difference the mode of governance has made in the re-contextualisation of the projects. The comparison shows that the democratic governance generated a high degree of collective intelligence, involved multiple stakeholders and allowed critical evaluations beneficial in decreasing the risk-proneness, emphasising the site-specificity and bargaining for the city's benefit. The authors call for a more nuanced understanding of the local governance within the re-contextualisation process of such initiatives and for further research regarding the transnational strategies of 'auxiliary institutions'.

AB  - Cross-border tourism governance processes have remained complex despite increasing permeability of European borders in the last decades. While it has been suggested that the presence of cross-border socio-cultural connections may alleviate border-related tourism management complexities, no detailed studies have been conducted yet to explore this assumption. This paper analyses the role of socio-cultural relations and history and identity discourses in destination development of the cross-border Vogtland region between the federal states of Saxony and Thuringia (Germany). Results of the mixed-method case study indicate that even though financial incentives remain central for cooperation, mobilising an identity discourse facilitates cross-border tourism governance in three ways: through (i) reducing the perception among stakeholders that administrative borders pose barriers for cooperation; (ii) internal stimulation of discussion of socio-economic and identity futures, and (iii) external presentation of a univocal destination image, thereby reducing marketing ambiguity and re-fuelling internal regional identity performativity. These effects are critically dependent on political decisions and the integrative institutionalisation of diverse stakeholders' voices in the destination development and management process. Capitalising on place identities may facilitate cross-border destination development but may also create pitfalls to safeguard the regional integration of stakeholders in this process.

AB  - The reformation of the Swedish agricultural system, about 150 years ago, drastically changed the use of semi-natural grasslands. Grassland plant diversity has declined due to abandonment, changed management methods and production intensification. Current diversity patterns are thus a result of historical and current land use in combination. In this study we investigate the relative importance of historical grassland management and current land use for grassland plant diversity. The distribution of 128 grassland plant species in an agricultural landscape in southwest Sweden was analysed in relation to current land use and land use in three historical time periods; the 18th and the 19th century and around 1960. Land use during the three historical periods was also combined into land-use sequences. Four diversity estimates were used: number of grassland species, number of grassland specialists, Shannon-Wiener index on the specialists and total cover/hectare of specialists. Historical land use - especially 18th century and the land-use sequences - explained more of the variation among study sites than did current land use. Continuity of a specific management type was important for grassland plants as indicated by highest diversities being found in pastures continuously grazed since the 18th century. Former hay meadows, currently grazed, did not differ in any diversity estimate from abandoned hay meadows, indicating that change of management from mowing to grazing a century ago may cause diversity declines similar to abandonment some 40 years ago. Limited artificial fertilisation in the managed areas may have contributed to this effect. Further decline in grassland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape is expected because a substantial proportion of grassland plant populations occur in abandoned areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - How has ecological knowledge been applied in Norwegian management of hydropower and protected areas? By recognizing a diversity of environmental knowledges' and science as potentially subordinated to political and economic interests, we explain the link between ecological knowledge and management by the state and scale of knowledge, political conflict and international commitments. The analysis is guided by case-study methodology. We find that ecological knowledge has had weak impact in the management reform of protected areas and been reduced as a decision-making premise in hydropower management. Differing combinations of case-specific factors have produced these outcomes. In the case of protected areas, ecological knowledge was suppressed mainly by opposing economic interests. The hydropower case showed how competing environmental knowledge and international commitments related to renewable energy and climate change overshadowed nature management concerns. These observations highlight the importance of differentiating between types of environmental knowledge and between knowledge and interests in the study of nature management.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between land-use and floristic diversity between 600 BC and AD 2008 in the uplands of southern Sweden. We use fossil pollen assemblages and the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model to quantitatively reconstruct land cover at a regional scale. Floristic richness and evenness are estimated using palynological richness and REVEALS-based evenness, respectively. We focus on the period AD 350 to 750 to investigate the impact of an inferred, short-lived (< 200 yr) period of land-use expansion and subsequent land abandonment on vegetation composition and floristic diversity. The observed vegetation response is compared to that recorded during the transition from traditional to modern land-use management at the end of the 19th century. Our results suggest that agricultural land use was most widespread between AD 350 and 1850, which correlates broadly with high values of palynological richness. REVEALS-based evenness was highest between AD 500 and 1600 which indicates a more equal cover among taxa during this time interval. Palynological richness increased during the inferred land-use expansion after AD 350 and decreased during the subsequent regression AD 550-750, while REVEALS-based evenness increased throughout this period. The values of palynological richness during the last few decades are within the range observed during the last 1650 yr. However, REVEALS-based evenness shows much lower values during the last century compared to the previous ca. 2600 yr, which indicates that the composition of present-day vegetation is unusual in a millennial perspective. Our results show that regional scale changes in land use have had clear impacts on floristic diversity in southern Sweden, with a vegetation response time of less than 20 to 50 yr. We show the importance of traditional land use to attain high biodiversity and suggest that ecosystem management should include a regional landscape perspective.

AB  - Many forests throughout the world contain legacies of former human impacts and management. This study reviews evidence of floristic legacies in the understory of Swedish boreo-nemoral forests, and presents a case study on two currently declining forest plants, suggested to have been favored by historical use of forests. The review provides evidence of forest remnant populations of 34 grassland species. Thus, many floristic legacies have their main occurrence in semi-natural grasslands, but maintain remnant populations in forests, in some cases more than 100 years after grazing and mowing management have ceased. Despite less information on true forest understory plants appearing as legacies of historical human use of boreo-nemoral forests, a putative guild of such species is suggested. The case study on two species, Chimaphila umbellata and Moneses uniflora (Pyroleae, Ericaceae) suggests that both species are currently declining, mainly due to modern forestry and ceased livestock grazing in forests. Chimaphila maintains remnant populations during decades, due to its extensive clonal capacity and its long-lived ramets. Moneses is more sensitive, due to a lower stature, weaker clonal capacity and short-lived ramets, flowering only once during their lifetime. Thus, Moneses have more transient occurrences, and will decline rapidly under deteriorating conditions.
