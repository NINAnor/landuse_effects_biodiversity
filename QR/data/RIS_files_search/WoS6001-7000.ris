AB  - We compared the degree of needle damage and the abundance of common insect pests in Scots pine stands on the Finnish and Russian sides of the border on the Karelian Isthmus. The study areas have similar climatic and geological conditions, but the intensity of forest management has been much higher on the Finnish side of the border during the past 50 years. In Finland all stands are thinned once or twice during the rotation period, while there are no thinnings in the Russian side. The density of the Scots pine stands and the proportion of dead trees were significantly higher on the Russian side of the border. Needle damage caused by folivorous insects was about eight times higher in the non-managed forests of Russian Karelia compared to the managed Finnish forests. Shoot twigs damaged by pine shoot beetles (Tomicus spp.) - the dominant bark beetle on Scots pine - and the number of egg clusters of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer) - the dominant defoliator, respectively - were also more abundant in samples collected from the trees on the Russian side of the border. There were, however, no differences in the number of aphid eggs or in the number of galls caused by Eversia resinella. Therefore, intensive forest management in Finland has changed the susceptibility of pine forests to insect pests compared to the situation in semi-natural forest on the Russian side of the border. However, these effects varied in accordance with the insect feeding guild. Especially bark beetles depending on recently dead trees benefit on unthinned forests where natural mortality of trees is high. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry has the potential to make a significant contribution to economic development and seafood production globally - particularly in rural and coastal communities. However, the lack of social licence to operate (SLO) can become a barrier for industry development. Greater transparency and communication have been suggested as two of the potential drivers for the industry to achieve SLO. This study explores the role of transparency and communication in the achievement of SLO in the salmon aquaculture industry by contrasting the perceptions of relevant stakeholders (researchers, managers/regulators, NGOs/ community groups, and industry). The comparison was carried out in Norway, having national ocean policies incorporating SLO, and Nova Scotia, Canada, that has adopted new aquaculture regulations in 2015 following a three-year moratorium. Results highlight the need for industry to take on a leadership role in transparency and communication. Results also reinforce the importance of meaningful engagement and reporting of environmental standards, but also the need to monitor and report social standards. Comparison of Norway and Nova Scotia helps to understand the role of transparency and communication in achieving SLO, which may be key to promoting the development and sustainability of the salmon aquaculture industry worldwide.

AB  - Climate velocity is an increasingly used metric to detect habitats, locations and regions which are exposed to high rates of climate change and displacement. In general, velocities are measured based on the assumption that future climatically similar locations can occur anywhere in the study landscape. However, this assumption can provide a biased basis for habitats which are constrained to specific environmental conditions. For such habitats, a set of selected suitable locations may provide ecologically more realistic velocity measures. Here, we focus on one environmentally constrained habitat, aapa mires, which are peat-accumulating EU Habitats Directive pri-ority habitats, whose ecological conditions and biodiversity values may be jeopardised by climate change. We assess the climate exposure of aapa mires in Finland by developing velocity metrics separately for the whole >= 10 ha aapa mire complexes ('aapa mires') and their wettest flark-dominated parts ('flark fens'). Velocity metrics were developed for six bioclimatic variables (growing degree days (GDD5), mean January and July temperatures, annual precipitation, and May and July water balance, based on climate data for 1981-2010 and for 2040-2069 as derived from global climate models for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). For the six variables, velocities were calculated based on the distance between climatically similar present-day and nearest future mire, divided by the number of years between the two periods, and by excluding the unsuitable matrix. Both aapa mires and flark fens showed high exposure (>5 km/year) to changes in January temperature, and often also considerably high velocities for GDD5 and July temperatures. The flark fens showed significantly higher climate velocities than the aapa mires and had a smaller amount of corresponding habitat in their sur-roundings. Thus, many of the studied mires, particularly the flark fens, are likely to face increased risks of exposure due to changes in winter and summer temperatures. Moreover, considerable changes in precipitation -related conditions may occur at the southern margin of the aapa mire zone. Our results show that specifically tailored climate velocity metrics can provide a useful quantitative tool to inform conservation and management decisions to support the ecosystem sustainability of this EU Habitats Directive biotope and targeting restoration towards the most vulnerable aapa mires.

AB  - Extractable Organic N (EON) or Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) pools are often analyzed to predict N mineralisation, N leaching, and to evaluate agricultural (nutrient) management practices. Size and characteristics of both pools, however, are strongly influenced by methodology. Quantifying the influence of methodology can increase the accuracy of soil tests to predict N mineralisation, improve model simulations, and can help to quantify the contribution of the EON and DON pools to soil N cycling. We estimated the relative impact of methodological, management, and environmental factors on EON and DON, using a meta-analysis approach based on 127 studies. Our results indicate that the EON and DON pools are neither similar in size nor controlled by the same factors. The influence of factors controlling EON generally decreased in the order of methodology (Delta 10-2400%), followed by environment (Delta 11-270%) and management (Delta 16-77%). DON concentrations were primarily controlled by management factors: different land use and fertilisation caused a variation of 37-118%. Seasonal variations in DON concentrations were generally smaller than variations in EON, suggesting that high mineralisation and sorption rates buffer DON. The large range in EON as affected by different methodology emphasizes the importance of using appropriate and standardized methods for the determination of EON. The determination of DON can be useful to estimate leaching losses. EON, however, can be used to assess the impact of soil management practices on the turnover rate of labile soil organic matter pools. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To support sustainable urban mobility strategies, reallocating road space from private vehicles to other uses may be a relevant intervention. Novel empirical knowledge could reduce barriers for implementing such interventions. A planned, 14-month capacity reduction of a main road tunnel in Oslo, Norway, carrying 70,000 vehicles a day, offered an excellent opportunity to document how commuters adapted, and what effects and consequences they experienced. Analyses of traffic data were combined with surveys and interviews with commuters. Congestion increased in the tunnel and on adjacent road-links, although road users adapted in ways resulting in significant traffic reduction through the tunnel. Some employees in an area near the tunnel experienced increased time-usage on their commute, and some adapted by changing transport mode, route, or trip-timing. However, results showed that they did not experience major negative consequences. Few commuters reported a need to shift routines in the household, and commuter satisfaction remained high.

AB  - This article outlines my career as a counseling psychologist trained in integrated behavioral health care and trauma treatment prior to becoming a self-employed consultant for Samaria, a Finnish non-governmental organization (NGO), engaged in aftercare activities for individuals identified as victims of human trafficking. I became interested in working with victims of human trafficking after hearing a leader of Project Rescue, an international antitrafficking organization, speak at the church I attend. Particularly, I developed a specific interest in providing intensive and on-the-job training to employees and volunteers of these programs in an effort to promote longitudinal consistency in the provision of service, improve staff self-care practices, and reduce caregiver attrition in a field where compassionate and competent care is emotionally draining and time-intensive.
   Impact Statement Impact Statement: Discussions related to provision of cross-cultural and trauma-informed care for survivors of human trafficking is vital for recovery efforts. While research can inform and training can prepare for work in safe-house settings, it is important to continually engage in training efforts to adjust for the impact of culture on trauma expression and to improve services for the most vulnerable.

AB  - In northern Europe, the first indications of a Neolithic lifestyle appear around 4000 cal BC from northern Germany up to middle Sweden and south-eastern Norway in an apparently short period of time, largely carried by immigrant populations bringing new species of plants and animals into the region. However, the nature of this domestication "package" is not everywhere the same, whereby both environmental and cultural filters acted on the particular set of species cultivated and bred in different regions. In Neolithic Scandinavia, cattle, pigs, and caprines (sheep and goat) are all present in varying proportions, with cattle more prominent in Denmark and pigs more prominent in more northerly areas. However, little is known about the ratio of sheep to goat remains within this region, largely due to difficulties in morphologically separating the two species. In this paper, we report the results from ZooMS analysis of 45 sheep/goat bone samples from two recently excavated Funnel Beaker settlements in Karleby, Falbygden, Sweden. The ZooMS analyses gave a clear and somewhat surprising result: 33 of the samples were classed as sheep, one as deer, and none of them as goat. In all likelihood, goats have not been present at all on these sites. A survey of the literature shows that while small numbers of goats are likely present in Denmark from the Early Neolithic, their presence in Sweden at this time is ambiguous and the few claims merit reassessment. Furthermore, the low numbers in Scandinavia compared to central and southern Europe suggests an overall geographic trend, with decreasing proportions of caprines as well as goats in the north.

AB  - We used national scenario analyses to examine the effects of fertilization, use of improved regeneration material and ditch network maintenance (DNM), both separately and simultaneously, on timber production of Finnish forests under the current climate. We also analyzed how the area of artificial regeneration, forest fertilization, and DNM developed in different management and harvesting intensity scenarios. The initial data were obtained from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland, excluding protected forests. Four sets of even-flow harvesting scenarios with annual timber harvest targets of 60, 70, 80, and 90 million m(3) were developed for 90-year simulation period. Use of improved material in artificial forest regeneration was assumed to result in 10% higher diameter and height increment compared to naturally regenerated seedlings. Sub-xeric pine-dominated and mesic spruce-dominated sites were fertilized, and 40% of drained peatlands were maintenance-ditched when they fulfilled a set of predetermined criteria for temperature sum, stand basal area, and mean tree diameter. As a result, when fertilization, improved regeneration material, and DNM were all used, the mean annual volume increment over the 90-year simulation period increased by 3.4-5.4 million m(3) depending on harvesting intensity. The maximum sustainable harvest of timber would be almost 80 million m(3) yr(-1). The simulated fertilization area was about four times larger than the presently fertilized area, and the simulated DNM area was about the same as the current. Fertilization gave the largest additional 90-year volume increment and the DNM the smallest when they were used separately. The use of improved regeneration material gave the largest additional volume increment in southern Finland and fertilization in central and northern Finland.

Using a concept of 'recycling junctions' as a means of understanding historical recycling processes, the article focuses on beverage packaging to argue that effective recycling in the modern green state depends on a combination of technologically mediated convenience and green consumer-citizenship, involving a wide range of actors.

Here, we review the importance of intact forest ecosystems to dead wood fungi, as well as trends in their diversity research and challenges in conservation. Saproxylic communities are sensitive to transition from virgin forests to managed ecosystems, since the latter often results in reduced tree diversity and the removal of their natural habitat dead wood. The impact of dead wood management can be quite significant since many saproxylic fungi are host-specific. The significance of citizen science and educational programmes for saproxylic mycology is discussed with the emphasis on the North American region. We intend to raise the awareness of the role that dead wood fungi play in forest health in order to support development of corresponding conservational programmes.

AB  - For coastal areas across the world, sea-level rise and problems of coastal erosion and coastal flooding are expected to increase over the next hundred years. At the same time political pressure for continued waterfront planning and development of coastal areas threatens to increase our societal vulnerability, and necessitating climate adaptation in coastal zone management. The institutional dimension has been identified as important for ensuring a more robust adaptation to both current climate variability and future climate change. In this paper, lessons regarding institutional constraints for climate adaptation are drawn from a Swedish case-study on local coastal zone management, illustrating the diverse and complex nature of institutional capacity-building. The aim of the paper is to illustrate critical factors that from an institutional perspective condition the capacity to achieve a more integrated, strategic and proactive climate adaptation and for turning "rules on paper" to working practice, based on case-study experiences from Coastby. Following and expanding a framework for analysing institutional capacity-building we learnt that a selective few key actors had played a critical role in building a strong external networking capacity with a flip-side in terms of a weak internal coordinating capacity and lack of mutual ownership of coastal erosion between sectoral units e.g. risk-management, planning and environment. We also found a weak vertical administrative interplay and lack of formal coherent policy, procedures and regulations for managing coastal erosion between local, regional and national administrations. Further, tensions and trade-offs between policy-agendas, values and political priorities posed a barrier for capacity-building in coastal zone management which calls for processes to mediate conflicting priorities in policy-making, planning and decision-making. The case-study suggests that the ability of the political administrative system to acknowledge and deal with institutional conflicts is a critical condition for ensuring an integrated and proactive climate adaptation in coastal zone management.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning green infrastructure for the landscape to remain ecologically functional. However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators.

LA  - English
AB  - The results of mapping critical loads, areas where they have been exceeded and steady state (Ca+Mg+K)/Al ratios of soils in Sweden, has been used to assess the order of magnitude of the ecological and economic risks involved with acid deposition for Swedish forests. The results of the calculations indicate that 81% of the Swedish forested area receive acid deposition in excess of the critical load at present. Under continued deposition at 1990 level, forest die-back is predicted to occur on approximately 1% of the forested area, and significant growth rate reductions are predicted for 80% of the Swedish forested area. For Sweden, growth losses in the order of 17.5 million m(-3) yr(-1) is predicted, equivalent to approximately 19% of current growth. Comparable losses can be predicted for other Nordic countries. The soil acidification situation is predicted to deteriorate significantly during the next 5-15 years, unless rapid emission reductions can be achieved. A minimum deposition reduction over Sweden of 85% on sulphur deposition and 30% on the N deposition in relation to 1990 level is required in order to protect 95% of the Swedish forest ecosystems from adverse effects of acidification. A minimum reduction of 60% on sulphur deposition and 30% on the N deposition is required to keep forest harvest at planned levels.

AB  - Local governments increasingly initiate measures addressing global sustainability challenges, so-called local governance experiments. But the knowledge about their actual outcome is limited. Responding to this gap, this paper provides an assessment of a local governance experiment in the form of a programme for sustainable buildings in Malmo, Sweden, focusing on its energy components. The study assesses the initiative by studying all new multi-residential units constructed in Malmo and analysing their performance along with programme applicability. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the programme, and further improved performance when the programme was combined with a dialogue process together with developers in a showcase area of Malmo. The majority of developers estimated the costs for following the programme as limited. The findings contradict the view that local initiatives addressing global sustainability challenges are merely rhetorical. However, the partly insufficient implementation risks undermining the trust-building function of local governance experimets.

AB  - That fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) can contribute to the sustainability and legitimacy of environmental planning and management is widely accepted. Nevertheless, despite this broad consensus about its importance, there is uncertainty about the ways in which FEK can be captured methodologically. Here, we present the results of a methodological inquiry aimed to connect FEK to the diversity of work practices within fisheries. Using a sample from a qualitative study of Swedish small-scale fishers, we test to what extent a new combination of concept and method - Fishing Style analysis and the Structure-Dynamic-Function framework - can produce insights into the partiality and diversity of FEK, as well as its embodied and tacit aspects. Results demonstrate how different work practices generate a variety of FEKs. We use this finding to discuss the implications of our work for future study of FEK, and how attention to FEK can inform environmental planning and management.

AB  - We have evaluated the cultivation potential of sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) as a function of latitude and position (near- and offshore) along the Norwegian coast using a coupled 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical-kelp model system (SINMOD) run for four growth seasons (2012-2016). The results are spatially explicit and may be used to compare the suitability of different regions for kelp cultivation, both inshore and offshore. The simulation results were compared with growth data from kelp cultivation experiments and in situ observations on coverage of naturally growing kelp. The model demonstrated a higher production potential offshore than in inshore regions, which is mainly due to the limitations in nutrient availability caused by the stratification found along the coast. However, suitable locations for kelp cultivation were also identified in areas with high vertical mixing close to the shore. The results indicate a latitudinal effect on the timing of the optimal period of growth, with the prime growth period being up to 2 months earlier in the south (58 degrees N) than in the north (71 degrees N). Although the maximum cultivation potential was similar in the six marine ecoregions in Norway (150-200 tons per hectare per year), the deployment time of the cultures seems to matter significantly in the south, but less so in the north. The results are discussed, focusing on their potential significance for optimized cultivation and to support decision making toward sustainable management.

AB  - A holistic understanding of the complex interactions between humans, wildlife, and habitats is essential for the design of sustainable wildlife policies. This challenging task requires innovative and interdisciplinary research approaches. Using the newly implemented ecosystem-based management of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden as a case, we applied Ostrom's social-ecological system (SES) framework to analyse the challenges that wildlife management faces throughout the country. We combined data derived from natural and social science research to operationalize the framework in a quantitative way; an approach that enabled a spatially explicit analysis on the national and regional levels. This study aimed to discover patterns In the social-ecological context of Swedish moose management. Identifying these patterns can provide input for an in-depth evaluation of the institutional fit of the current system and subsequently for national policy development. Our SES maps suggest that there are spatial variations in factors challenging moose management. In some areas, ecological aspects such as the co-occurrence of carnivores and other ungulate species burdens future management, while in other regions challenges are shaped by governance aspects, e.g. diverse property rights. These findings demonstrate that the new management system must apply adaptive learning principles to respond to local context attributes in order to be successful. Our innovative approach provides a valuable tool for the assessment of other natural resource management issues and the avoidance of panacea traps, especially when repeated over time.

AB  - Spruce planting (Picea abies) in coastal birch forests (Betula pubescens) of northern Norway could influence ground-nesting species such as willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix). Predator-specific predation rates on baited trackboards were therefore studied in 3 successional edge gradients: birch forest adjacent to (1) closed spruce plantations, (2) open spruce plantations, and (3) clearings. We also examined the influence of 2 types of landscape-level variables on predation rates: the distance from sampling location to the nearest roads and buildings and the land use composition within a l-km radius of the sample. Predation rates were dominated by 2 generalist species: red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (19.2%) and hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) (7.5%). Predation appears dependent on the successional stage of spruce plantations, with areas near clearings (63.5%) and open spruce plantations (59.8%) experiencing higher predation pressures than closed spruce plantations (45.3%). However, predation rates were highly variable among landscape blocks. Neither landscape nor vegetation variables could explain this block-level variation. We discuss alternative mechanisms that could explain differences between landscape blocks, but further studies are needed to understand the spatial heterogeneity of predators at larger scales.

AB  - The literature on ecosystem management and assessment is increasingly focusing on social capacity to enhance ecosystem resilience. Organizational flexibility, participatory approaches to learning, and knowledge generation for responding adequately to environmental change have been highlighted but not critically assessed. The small, flexible municipal organization, Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV) in southern Sweden, has identified win-win situations and gained broad support and legitimacy for ecosystem management among a diversity of actors in the region. Navigating the existing legal-political framework, EKV has built a loose social network of local stewards and key persons from organizations at municipal and higher societal levels. As a 'bridging organization', EKV has created arenas for trust-building, knowledge generation, collaborative learning, preference formation, and conflicts solving among actors in relation to specific environmental issues. Ad hoc projects are developed as issues arise by mobilizing individuals from the social network. Our results suggest that the EKV approach to adaptive comanagement has enhanced the social capacity to respond to unpredictable change and developed a trajectory towards resilience of a desirable social-ecological system.

AB  - The complex nature of the Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) requires the integration and consideration of multiple elements, ranging from the ecological and environmental to the socio-economic as well as the political, institutional or cultural. To succeed, the public policies demand techniques and tools that allow to evaluate the effects or impacts on the society. By applying an empirical approach, this paper presents a framework to evaluate the direct economic impacts linked to the implementation of MSP policies in three case studies: Belgium, Germany and Norway. The methodological procedure is sequenced in 4 phases: identification of the sectors involved, data collection, construction of counterfactual scenarios and estimate of impacts after consulting the stakeholders. With the application of this framework to the case studies, an estimate was made of the variations in the value of production for each marine sector that can be directly attributed to the implementation of the MSP. In general, they were positive in the three cases analysed. In the medium scenario, cumulative final direct impacts of euro 1875 million were estimated in the German case (2010-2016 period), euro 929 million in the Belgian case (2014-2016) and euro 2262 million in the Norwegian case (2013-2016). These results can serve as the basis for further estimations of indirect and induced impacts of the implementation of spatial management policies in a blue economy context.

AB  - Cities' role in addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation is becoming increasingly important. Within the last decade, cities together with other actors have initiated neighborhood-level climate change projects that build on the concept of experimentation using participation and coproduction. Common features in these initiatives are the limitation of the project to a geographically specific area within the city, inclusion of stakeholders from that physical location, and the use of different types of experimentation through participation in order to pursue climate objectives. This qualitative case study discusses the participatory experimentation and potential structural transformations by focusing on the Climate Street project of Helsinki and Vantaa, Finland. More specifically, we examine how learning, participation, and public visibility contribute toward the impact of the project. Our results show that existing urban governance structures restrict experiments in many ways and only certain types of change are feasible. This implies that while participatory experimentation offers promise but is not a panacea in terms of governing climate change.

AB  - For decades, inshore commercial fisheries of Sweden have declined in the number of fishermen. In parallel, the service economy has gained importance and the growth in tourism is one example. This implicates new conditions for small firms, active in traditional rural industries. While knowledge about the socio-cultural context of small tourism firms is underdeveloped and since policymaking assigns these firms a key role in sustainable rural development, this article aims to explore a traditional industry in change during the first decades of the twenty-first century. This qualitative study is based on a fieldwork inspired by multi-sited ethnography, conducted at the Swedish west coast for a dissertation published in 2019. Drawing on discourse theory and the concept of positioning, the analysis concludes that inshore fisheries in the service economy are expected to become sustainable entrepreneurs and hosts for their communities. The fishermen position themselves in a contradictory manner both resisting and conforming to the political management discourse. The contemporary service-oriented economy and social relations largely form these small firms, which are characterised by both a high dependency on authorities and by their encounters with harbour visitors.

AB  - Forests are assumed to play a significant role in relation to climate change mitigation. However, previous studies show that actor groups' perspectives vary regarding how to best utilize forests. This paper focuses on exploring frames in recent Swedish forest-and climate politics and to what extent they may form the basis for conflict resolution or contribute to perpetuate conflicts among actors. The analysis of recent forest-and climate policies, and actor groups' positioning on the issues, builds upon the pathways to sustainability approach in combination with frame analysis. The results showed that ideas based on "Ecological Modernisation" dominated within the forest-climate nexus, but also a clear presence of alternative frames promoting "Sustainable Development". As a result, conflicting frames were identified within the policies on how to reach policy targets -stressing both the importance of consensus and neutral dialogue with actors, while concurrently prioritizing an economic perspective.

AB  - In general, urban social sustainability has received little recognition in built environment disciplines. To comprehend the social dimensions of sustainable urban design, an understanding of urban planning features is required which takes into consideration the engagement of the local community. The article focuses on the impact that intense sustainable urban transformation has on localities in East Asia and Europe. The comparative research is based on a study of four large-scale urban sustainable cases in Northeast Asia (eco-cities "Sino-German Ecopark" in Qingdao, China; and "Pangyo" in Seongnam, Korea) and Europe (sustainable neighbourhoods "Vauban" in Freiburg, Germany; and "Hammarby Sjostad" in Stockholm, Sweden). The research focuses on the connections and interactions between sustainable urban design and aspects of urban social sustainability. The paper represents an effort to unravel the social dimensions of eco-cities / sustainable neighbourhood projects by investigating how sustainable urban development is articulated and manifested in Europe and Northeast Asia. The final research output consists of the identification of sustainable urban design elements (e.g. community centres, plazas, parks and green zones, etc.) and policies (e.g. affordable housing accessible, public transportation, diversity of housing typologies, etc.) that could enforce the "urban social sustainability". The conclusive analysis offers a source of inspiration and potential policy orientations for cities that are in the process of sustainable transformation.

AB  - We estimated potential limits to anthropogenic mortality for harbour porpoises in the Baltic region (the Skagerrak, Kattegat, Great Belt and Little Belt Seas, the Kiel and Mecklenburg Bights, and the Baltic Sea) using conservation objectives set by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans in the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS). Mortality limits (ML) were calculated as the product of. a minimum estimate of abundance, one-half the maximum rate of increase and an uncertainty factor. Previous models show that if anthropogenic mortality is less than ML, a depleted population should recover to more than 80% of carrying capacity, meeting the conservation objectives of ASCOBANS. Minimum estimates of by-catches exceed ML for the population structure hypothesis tested. indicating that these catches will impede recovery. The same result was also evident for other hypothetical population structures. We conclude that immediate management actions are necessary to reduce the magnitude of by-catches to meet the conservation objectives of ASCOBANS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth of collaborative approaches to governance has resulted in increasingly complex policy and management landscapes, where actors are presented with ever-increasing numbers of decision-making venues they can participate in and actors they can collaborate with. Given that actors face constraints on their capacity to manage actor and venue relationships in such polycentric governance systems, we assume the marginal benefit of yet another relationship should begin to diminish at some level of engagement. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such capacity limitations are not static, but decrease as actors learn, develop skills, and formulate strategies for how to navigate complex polycentric systems more effectively. Drawing on the Ecology of Games framework, this article investigates two Swedish collaborative governance initiatives where a multitude of actors came together to address a range of different, but interrelated, policy issues and management tasks. The empirical findings suggest that actors' capacities to successfully navigate polycentric governance arrangements increase as they gain experience and develop their networking skills. Our findings imply there is a need to balance increased complexity in polycentric systems with increased capacity, otherwise the overall effect of an ever-increasing number of venues and actors could be collaborative fatigue and decreased abilities to address diverse governance challenges.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to describe an exploratory research and design process that uses illustrative techniques to bridge the gap between theoretical principles of systems ecology, stakeholder input and a workable physical planning strategy for Ultuna Campus in Uppsala, Sweden. Design/methodology/approach Stakeholder interviews provide the empirical basis for this exploratory design process, in conjunction with landscape analysis, and review of previous proposals for campus development. Central principles of self-organizing systems are selected and concretized as visionary hypotheses in a physical context. Preliminary design concepts and plans illustrate sustainable systems while supporting new functional programmatic requirements: housing, industry-research collaboration, transportation and community-integrated landscapes. Findings The result is a proposal based on regenerative landscape design, envisioning campus Ultuna as a coherent whole.
   Research limitations/implications - A large-scale modern building program is already underway at Ultuna, and rapid urbanization in the surrounding region coupled with projected growth on campus suggests future intensification of university lands. A master plan to be implemented until 2040 is now in the preliminary design phase. Ultuna is home to significant cultural and ecological landscapes, and a holistic approach is called for. Practical implications - Illustrative techniques suggest ways to synthesize knowledge by creating future scenarios that are workable in practice. Social implications Global challenges call for designs that enhance environmental and human resources and their capacity to regenerate over time. Sustainability objectives are particularly crucial when envisioning university campuses; the environment serves as a laboratory for researchers, teachers, students and residents of the surrounding community. Originality/value This paper describes an innovative process for bridging ecological principles, stakeholder perspectives and practical design strategies for sustainable campuses.

AB  - In a 136 km(2) coniferous area in southeastern Norway, 13 of 24 past leks, known from the 1930-40S, went extinct and 5 new leks were established, by 1985. There was no difference in extinction rate between clearfelled (7 of 13) and untreated (6 of 11) leks. Number of leks, number of cocks per lek, and total number of cocks were reduced by 33, 53, and 69%, respectively, compared with a 69% reduction in suitable habitat (forest. older than 70 years). We argue that the overall population decline merely was due to a general fragmentation of suitable habitats, rather than direct clearfelling of lek areas.

AB  - Recreation management on public land often involves trade-offs. For example, cross-country skiers may experience conflict with snowmobiles. A potential management response is trail separation, which may lead to gains to skiers but also ecological and financial costs associated with creation of a new trail. If separation involves snowmobile access restrictions, there may be experiential losses for that user group. Management responses are not always based on explicit identification and integration of the gains and losses accruing across diverse stakeholders and dimensions; economics provides a criterion, a metric, and measurement tools to facilitate such integration. A Swedish case study illustrates this approach and assesses values accruing to skiers from reduced snowmobile presence. Cross-country skiers were sampled on-site in the southern Jamtland mountain region, and follow-up mail surveys included choice experiment scenarios. Conditional logit analysis of the 1,468 completed scenarios indicates that skier welfare gains from conflict reduction are substantial and reflect both direct and indirect contact. A change from sharing trails to not seeing, hearing, or smelling snowmobiles leads to gains of 185 kronor (US$23) per skier party. FOR. SCI. 55(3):201-209.

AB  - Improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewables within the building stock is crucial to ensure the achievement of international and national climate goals, such as bringing about a carbon neutral society. The existing buildings needs to be retrofitted and heated by renewable energy sources. However, this may lead to conflicts with other sustainability goals, such as the preservation of cultural heritage values within the built environment. The design of the legal system can be assumed to have a decisive role in well-developed Rechtsstaats in how these conflicts are handled. One important criterion for the achievement of overall sustainability objectives is that the legal system as a whole is coherent and without deficits, loopholes, and conflicts contradicting goal fulfilment. Moreover, the norms must be effectively applied and complied with. This article presents and elaborates on deficits in the legal system and its application, in particular within the land use planning and building legislation and the heritage protection law, in handling the conflicts between reaching energy goals while preserving heritage values and achieving a sustainable development. The important deficits identified include the lack of legal requirements on the adoption of holistic approaches and the assurance of adequate knowledge in the planning and building processes. The analyses have been carried out through interdisciplinary cooperation within the research project Law, Sustainable Energy Use and Protection of Heritage (RECO), funded by the Swedish Energy Agency.

AB  - As a consequence of habitat loss, breeding in man-made habitats has become increasingly common for many coastal breeding bird species. While artificial sites provide valuable substitutes, they may also be more attractive, and importantly, differ in quality from natural sites. Therefore, information on habitat specific breeding success and their potential for supporting stable populations are needed. We compared little tern (Sternula albifrons) breeding success (nest and hatching success) between natural habitat (sandy beaches) and artificial port habitat at Bothnian Bay, Finland from 2006 to 2011. We further reviewed published estimates on pre-fledging and adult survival for little terns and least terns (Sternula antillarum), and used these ranges to estimate plausible parameter spaces for population growth rates given our estimates of breeding success. Nest success was among the highest reported for little terns in the artificial habitat (82 %) while being lower in the natural habitat (58 %). This difference may have resulted from differences in colony sizes and levels of disturbance. Hatching success did not differ significantly, but the percentage of successful nests containing unhatched eggs was twice as high in the natural habitat. The parameter spaces for population growth rates indicated that the artificial habitat has good potential to sustain stable populations (66 % positive growth rate) while for the natural habitat this potential was lower (37 % positive growth rate). While our results suggest that artificial habitats can be very productive breeding sites for habitat deprived tern populations, management should concentrate on improving both habitats with emphasis on natural sites.

AB  - Europe and North America share a similar history in the extirpation and subsequent recovery of large carnivore and ungulate species. Both continents face challenges and opportunities for managing human-wildlife conflict at the junction of livestock production and wildlife conservation. Predation of livestock and disease transmission between wildlife and livestock is an ongoing and escalating worldwide issue. In order to manage this conflict, producers need effective tools, and they have used livestock protection dogs (LPDs) for reducing predation for well over 2000 years. We review the history of the use of LPDs, including the loss of information on their use and the paucity of scientific research on their effectiveness. We discuss the potential for LPDs to be integral components in modern-day livestock husbandry and outline future directions to pursue.

AB  - Norway is one of the leading ocean-based food production nations. Its seafood industry comprises wild-capture fisheries and farmed fish production. Both industries play a provisional role but also contribute to economic development of the country and help sustain coastal communities, particularly, in Northern Norway. Coastal fishery has been the staple industry in Northern Norway for centuries, while aquaculture complemented the seafood production in this region only approximately 40 years ago. To date, there has been limited knowledge on how the two industries co-developed in Northern Norway. While there are controversies regarding the potential cost and benefit of aquaculture to local communities, only a few studies have addressed co-existence of the two seafood industries in Northern Norway on a municipality scale. In this study, we compared the development of coastal fisheries and aquaculture in Northern Norway over a 14-year period (2005-2018) using a Bayesian approach that allowed to fit a model specific to each municipality, accounting also for temporal changes in both industries. A strong stochastic spatial variation characterized both industries, indicating a sizeable gap in the seafood production between the municipalities. Finally, the study showed that the fisheries and aquaculture likely did not affect each other's production, suggesting that there were no or few discernible conflicts or synergies between these two industries in Northern Norway. This study featured an advanced method for analyzing variation of seafood production per administrative unit that can be transferable to assess seafood development in other regions of Norway and beyond.

AB  - Railway capacity allocation in a deregulated market requires planners to solve a mathematically complex optimization problem while simultaneously arbitrating the wants and needs of different stakeholders. This paper analyses timetable quality from the perspective of timetable planners working for the Swedish infrastructure manager Trafikverket. Seven quality aspects are discussed: feasibility, disturbance resistance, competition management, capacity safeguarding, application fulfilment, attractiveness and compatibility with surrounding planning areas. Each aspect is introduced, including references to legal documents, development projects, and research literature. Further, an interview study with eight practitioners gives insight into the current state of practice in Sweden. The practitioners consider feasibility to be both most important and easiest to handle. Capacity safeguarding is considered least important, despite its prevalence in legal documents and envisioned process developments, and is also considered hardest to handle. In general, formal rules and guidelines seem important for emphasising the importance of a quality aspect in the planning process. To better support the planners in their arbitrating role, timetable planning tools based on mathematical optimization models could be implemented. For example, support tools could be used to analyse different solutions, and could unburden the planner from working with feasibility aspects by providing automatic conflict identification and resolution.

AB  - Management impacts on dominant and keystone species form a major sustainability issue in forests, because such impacts can affect production of ecosystem goods and trigger extinction cascades. On acidic soils in northern forests, bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is a well-known field-layer plant that is important culturally and as food for wildlife and humans, and is affected negatively by intensive forestry. In this paper, we analyse bilberry performance in a semi-natural forestry system (based on multiple native tree species and largely natural regeneration); specifically in relation to two major silvicultural activities timber harvest and wetland drainage. We combined plot- and landscape-scale data from a range of forest types varying in soil moisture and nutrient richness in Estonia, and compiled a landscape retrospective of bilberry abundance. Clear-cutting sharply reduced bilberry abundance on mineral soils and green-tree retention only slightly mitigated that impact; however, in drier sites, some recovery had started in 10 years. By the mature stage of production forests (60-80 years post clear-cutting), bilberry cover had recovered to the levels observed in old growth. Artificial drainage increased bilberry cover on poor peat soils, and partial cutting of drained pine forests further enhanced it. A retrospective analysis of these patterns in a forest-wetland landscape revealed a net increase in bilberry cover and berry production during the past 70 years. We conclude that the studied forestry system has increased bilberry cover in boggy areas with likely benefits to some herbivores (e.g. grouse) at the expense of wetland species; however, negative effects of clear-cutting prevail in dry pine forests that are the preferred berry-picking sites for humans.

AB  - Today, maintaining biodiversity is included in the targets of boreal forest management. A widespread approach in northern Europe is to identify and preserve woodland key habitats within managed forests. Woodland key habitats are expected to be patches that host populations of threatened and declining species, and the preservation of these patches is assumed to enable the persistence of the focal species in the landscape. In Finland, the criteria for selecting woodland key habitats are defined in the Finnish Forest Act, and the selection has been done by forest practitioners. Our objective was to determine whether the surroundings of boreal brooks and rivulets qualified as key habitats are truly different from brook-side habitats not granted the key habitat status, and whether the brook-side habitats of the two types differ from the forest matrix managed for timber production. We found that the two brook-side habitats were in most aspects rather alike but there was a difference in the composition of ground vegetation assemblages. In contrast, the control forests were distinct from the brook-sides in terms of dead wood, species richness and assemblages of polypores, species richness of epiphytic mosses, and the composition of beetle assemblages. We conclude that brook-sides in general provide an important habitat clearly diverging from the surrounding matrix but that the conservation value of the brook-sides granted the key habitat status may not be substantially larger than that of the brook-sides without the status.

AB  - The global goal for education for sustainable development (ESD) is to integrate it at all levels of education. For ensuring it the change has to be put in practice, by transforming universities. The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) strive to be among the regions that lead the way in enhancing ESD, and want to increase cooperation with China. It is therefore interesting to compare the region with China. We compared ESD and quality assurance between these areas at both policy and implementation levels. The former was based on literature, and the latter was studied with specific surveys in academia in both regions; in two provinces in China and in the Nordic countries. We investigated the possibilities to improve ESD in these regions by benefiting from quality assurance requirements. We found that both regions enhance ESD. The rather similar quality assurance requirements do not include ESD. In China, the respondents viewed quality assurance as sustainable development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resilience has become a vital theme in the discussion concerning urban water services. Resilience in this context can be defined as both keeping up a good level of services, as well as rapid and fluent recovery from failures caused by natural disasters, unsound infrastructure or incorrect management. Although adequate water services resilience can be considered as sustainable, resilience is a wider concept than sustainability. In order to call water services resilient, all sections from policy and management to technical operation should be clear and coherent, and their operation in challenging situations also must be guaranteed. This study seeks a resilient approach to water services through a literature review, and a questionnaire to stakeholders; mainly water supply and sanitation experts. The results show that sufficient technology and good water quality are not sufficient for achieving resilient water services, but also education and institutional management are essential issues. These are accomplished by a methodical education system, capacity building, and good governance.

AB  - Since the late 1990s, increased attention has been given to the role of organizations in implementing sustainable development, where sustainable development indicators (SDIs) are frequently recommended as useful tools. Due to limited knowledge on the application of SDIs in Swedish water utilities, a series of field studies were carried out in order to find out whether and how SDIs are applied. Concurrently, a literature survey was performed concerning the current use of SDIs in organizations in general. Both studies show that SDIs are frequently used in reporting, but not in planning and decision making, and hence may not contribute substantially to sustainable development. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) is often considered as a pragmatic approach to implement an ecosystem based management in order to manage marine space in a sustainable way. This requires the involvement of multiple actors and stakeholders at various governmental and societal levels. Several factors affect how well the integrated management of marine waters will be achieved, such as different governance settings (division of power between central and local governments), economic activities (and related priorities), external drivers, spatial scales, incentives and objectives, varying approaches to legislation and political will. We compared MSP in Belgium, Norway and the US to illustrate how the integration of stakeholders and governmental levels differs among these countries along the factors mentioned above. Horizontal integration (between sectors) is successful in all three countries, achieved through the use of neutral 'round-table' meeting places for all actors. Vertical integration between government levels varies, with Belgium and Norway having achieved full integration while the US lacks integration of the legislature due to sharp disagreements among stakeholders and unsuccessful partisan leadership. Success factors include political will and leadership, process transparency and stakeholder participation, and should be considered in all MSP development processes.

AB  - Are concepts related to biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems relevant to marine ecosystems? To address this question we start with a definition of "biological invasion" and some observations that show that this question is of more than academic interest. Several results are presented that show why scientists should consider biological invasions as experiments and should collaborate with managers to develop effective management procedures. Likewise, several results from "pure" science have been highly useful for conservation managers.

AB  - Question: Is plant diversity in fragmented semi-natural grasslands related to present and historical landscape context?
   Location: Southern Sweden.
   Methods: Plant diversity was described at 30 semi-natural grassland sites in terms of total and specialist plant species richness at the site and species density at different scales (0.5-10 m(2)). These measures are commonly used to assess conservation value of semi-natural grasslands. Landscape context was measured as contemporary connectivity to other semi-natural grasslands, historical connectivity 50 years ago, amount of linear elements potentially suitable for dispersal (road verges, power line clearings), and amount of forest (inverse of the openness of the landscape).
   Results: The diversity measures were generally correlated with each other, implying that species richness in a subset of the grassland can predict the total richness. Plant species density at three scales (0.5 m(2), 10 m(2) and total) was related to the landscape context using an information theoretic approach. Results showed that total species richness increased with increased size of grasslands, contrary to earlier diversity studies in semi-natural grasslands. Larger grasslands were more heterogeneous than smaller grasslands, and this is a likely reason for the species-area relationship. Heterogeneity was also of high importance at the smaller scales (0.5 m(2), 10 m(2)). With increased amount of forest, total species richness increased but species density on 10 m(2) decreased. There was no influence of connectivity in either the contemporary or the historical landscape, contrary to previous studies.
   Conclusions: Grassland size and heterogeneity are of greater importance for plant diversity in semi-natural grassland, than grassland connectivity in the landscape.

AB  - Spatially explicit historical land cover datasets are essential not only for simulations of climate and environmental dynamics but also for projections of future land use, food security, climate, and biodiversity. However, widely used global datasets are developed for continental- to global-scale analysis and simulations. Their accuracy depends on the verification of more regional reconstruction results. This study collects cropland area data of each administrative unit (parish/municipality/county) in Scandinavia from multiple sources. The cropland area data are validated, calibrated, interpolated, and allocated into 1 km x 1 km grid cells. Then, we develop a dataset with spatially explicit cropland area from 1690 to 1999. Results indicate that the cropland area increased from 1.82 x 10(6) ha to 6.71 x 10(6) ha from 1690 to 1950 and then decreased to 5.90 x 10(6) ha in 1999. Before 1810, cropland cover expanded in southern Scandinavia and remained stable in northern Scandinavia. From 1810 to 1910, northern Scandinavia experienced slight cropland expansion. The cropland area increased rapidly in the southern part of the study area before changing slightly. After 1950, the cropland areas began to decrease in most regions, especially in eastern Scandinavia. When comparing global datasets with this study, although the total Scandinavia cropland area is in agreement among SAGE (Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment), HYDE (History Database of the Global Environment) 3.2, PJ (Pongratz Julia), and this study, the spatial patterns show considerable differences, except for in Denmark between HYDE 3.2 and this study. The dataset can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.926591 (Wei et al., 2021).

AB  - Despite the promising features of blockchain, such as enhancing efficiency, transparency, immutability, cost savings, and traceability, the technology is still not widely adopted across industries. The oil and gas industry uses state-of-the-art engineering solutions for oil and gas exploration but substantially lags behind in using innovative digital technologies that can improve operational excellence. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing blockchain adoption strategies. The framework builds on critical factors for blockchain adoption and four adoption strategies - single use, localization, substitution, and transformation. Data were collected from ten experts in the Norwegian oil and gas industry using a structured web survey. The Bayesian Best Worst Method (BWM), a probabilistic MCDM method, was used for analysis. The results suggest that three sub-criteria, which are lack of expertise about technology, lack of supply chain partner collaboration, and reducing operation cost, have the most impact on the adoption process. As for blockchain adoption alternatives, the fourth phase, that is, transformation, is the most preferred in the context of the Norwegian oil and gas industry. The proposed framework lays the foundation for companies to understand the critical elements that need improvement to accelerate the blockchain technology adoption process.

AB  - Previous studies have found mixed results regarding the relationship between beta diversity and latitude. In addition, by influencing local environmental heterogeneity, land use may modify spatial taxonomic and functional variability among communities causing biotic differentiation or homogenization. We tested 1) whether taxonomic and functional beta diversities among streams within watersheds differ between subtropical and boreal regions and 2) whether land use is related to taxonomic and functional beta diversities in both regions. We sampled aquatic insects in 100 subtropical (Brazil) and 100 boreal (Finland) streams across a wide gradient of land use, including agriculture and exotic planted, secondary, and native forests. We calculated beta diversity at the watershed scale (among 5 streams in each watershed). We found higher taxonomic beta diversity among subtropical than among boreal streams, whereas functional beta diversity was similar between the 2 regions. Total land use was positively correlated with taxonomic and functional beta diversity among subtropical streams, while local environmental heterogeneity was positively correlated with beta diversity among boreal streams. We suggest that different types and intensities of land use may increase among-stream heterogeneity, promoting distinct insect assemblage compositions among streams. Our findings also suggest that beta diversity patterns and their underlying determinants are highly context dependent.

AB  - Young people represent the future, but little is known about their attitudes towards climate change, one of the most serious issues facing the world today. The purpose of the present study is to contribute with improved and new knowledge of young Norwegians' understanding of and attitudes towards this issue, with a special focus on perspectives of the future. Of particular interest is the influence of divergent framings of the climate question in Norway, due to conflicting interests between the petroleum industry and climate concern. The young people's voices are elicited through two different surveys undertaken during the fall of 2013, one national (Norwegian Citizen Panel) and one local (School survey conducted among high-school students). The study generated both quantitative and qualitative findings, stemming from closed-ended as well as open-ended questions. The data were handled through a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The results show that the voices tend to be oriented towards the opinion that Norway has a responsibility to help poor countries as well as a duty to prevent climate change and that the country should reduce its oil production. We further observe that young Norwegians have an optimistic view of the future, based on a pronounced belief in technology and science.

AB  - We used allozymes to investigate the structure of genetic variation in populations of the perennial herb Silene nutans at local (Denmark), regional (Nordic area) and wide (over a 19A degrees latitudinal gradient) geographic scales in north-western Europe. New data from Denmark were combined with data from previously studied Fennoscandian and western populations. We related patterns of nuclear variation for 26 Fennoscandian and western populations to the phylogeographic patterns revealed by four plastid (chloroplast) DNA markers. Levels of genetic diversity were similar within Denmark and Sweden/N Finland. Compared to Sweden/N Finland, the Danish populations show lower and nonsignificant F (IS) values. The genetic structure reveals no grouping of the Danish populations according to their geographic origin (Jutland-Zealand). Within Nordic populations (from Denmark, Sweden and N Finland), there is a weak geographic pattern of allozyme differentiation. The high latitude populations are genetically depauperate compared with populations from Western Europe. At the whole north-western European scale, the structure of allozyme variation within S. nutans shows geographic differentiation (Nordic versus western populations), and some congruence with plastid phylogeographic patterns. A high level of allozyme genetic differentiation is found between Nordic and western populations (8.0 %), but also between populations within haplotype categories (19.4 %). The overall geographic structure of allozyme variation of S. nutans appears to be primarily a reflection of past (postglacial) migration history, whereas more recent adaptive and stochastic processes have occurred at more local scales.

AB  - Geological tourism and related business opportunities are growing in the Barents area. To be able to develop this sector of tourism in a sustainable way, a cooperative project called "ABCGheritage-Arctic Biological, Cultural and Geological Heritage" has been created. The project is partly financed by the EU Kolarctic ENPI programme. In the geological heritage part of the project, the three main participants are the Geological Survey of Finland (Northern Finland Office), the Geological Institute of the Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Bioforsk Soil and Environment from north eastern Norway. The duration of the project is from 2012 to 2014. The main method for cherishing geological heritage is to raise the awareness of participants in the nature tourism sector about geology. It is also important to engage young people in the area to support the sustainable use of geological recreation areas. This can be achieved by educating the target groups of the project. Other examples of ways to protect geological recreation sites include a geological outdoor map. When such a map of an area is created, it guides tourists to travel along the safe and environmentally friendly routes. In this project, a geological outdoor map will be prepared for the Khibiny Tundra area located in the middle of the Kola Peninsula. Geological heritage trails with information panels will also be produced for some key areas. In total, there are ten different activities in the geological part of the project. The primary outputs of the project's geological heritage part are the geological outdoor map of Khibiny Tundra, the geological nature trails in the field, geological demonstration sites with signposting, and educational packages of geological heritage targeted at school students, teachers, and personnel working in nature tourism.

AB  - The global demand for aquaculture products is rising, driven by declining wild fisheries, food security, and blue economy policies and initiatives, suggesting that aquaculture is significant for a sustainable future, despite its negative environmental impacts. Here we investigate the role of law in accelerating the transition towards sustainable aquaculture activities. We use the EU taxonomy for environmentally sustainable activities to define transitional criteria and examine the use of regulations to accelerate the transition in Norway. Even though both the Norwegian government and industrial actors promote transition toward sustainability, we find few regulations in place that accelerate the transition, and we find that sustainability ambitions are likely to be unmet in a business-and-regulation-as-usual scenario. Additional to discussing the role of law in sustainability transitions, we offer a method which can be employed to analyze regulation of different sectors or geographical areas and to devise policy recommendations for sustainable transitions.

AB  - Effective climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture requires farmers to gain sufficient information to plan and implement practical climate-related actions. Science-based knowledge that meets actors' needs supports proactive action taking. The aim of this study was to characterize the views of farmers and other rural stakeholders regarding farmers' climate change information needs, and to identify potential barriers to and necessary incentives for applying climate change mitigation and adaptation in practice. Data were collected by conducting an internet survey in Finland for which 340 responses from farmers, farm advisers and other rural stakeholders were received. Applying cluster analysis, 5 information need profiles were identified: 'information highlighters', 'globally and nationally oriented', 'livestock oriented', 'plant production oriented' and 'no interest'. Half of the respondents believed that climate change would affect their activities in the near future. Among respondent groups, farmers themselves perceived the information on climate change as most uninteresting. The complexity of the current climate change communication and potential economic costs associated with proactivity were found to hinder both mitigation and proactive adaptation actions. Based on our study, climate change communication needs to be practice-oriented and tailored to fit the needs of farmers representing different lines of agricultural production and regional locations. Such information, plus an integration of an assessment of the effects of proactive action taking on farm profitability, is needed to encourage climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on Finnish farms.

AB  - Novel or emergent ecosystems arising from human action present both threats and opportunities for biodiversity. It has been suggested that exotic species can "facilitate" or "inhibit" native biodiversity through habitat modification. In Britain, there is a discussion over the contribution to biodiversity of plantations of exotic conifer species as these are commonly thought to have little relevancy as a habitat for native biodiversity. To address this we compared the species richness of a range of different taxonomic groups (lichens, bryophytes, fungi, vascular plants, invertebrates and songbirds) in exotic and native forest stands of differing structural stages in northern and southern Britain. In terms of overall native species-richness there was no significant difference between the exotic and the native stands. In the north, six species groups showed higher values in the exotic Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) stands with the remaining six showing higher values in the native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands. Most notably, lichen species richness was much lower in the exotic stands compared to the native stands, whereas bryophyte and fungal species richness was proportionately higher in the exotic stands. In the south, five species groups (all invertebrate taxa) showed higher species richness in exotic Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands compared to native oak (Quercus robur) stands. Five species groups had higher species-richness in the oak stands, in particular lichens and fungi. It is concluded that emergent ecosystems of exotic conifer species are not irrelevant to biodiversity. Where already well-established they can provide habitat for native species particularly if native woodland is scarce and biodiversity restoration is an immediate priority.

AB  - This article aims at illuminating the contemporary glacier tourism scene, and does so by showing how glacier tourism in Norway has developed as an adventure tourism activity over the past 7 years. In total, 17 companies offered guided glacier activities for approximately 2030,000 visitors per year. Data were collected by repeated interviews, website studies, and participant observation. The product variety covers guided day tours, longer guided tours, and glacier instructor courses. There has been product development from traditional glacier surface walks and activities in the glacier-arm area as well as glacier lake kayaking, terminal face walks, and ice climbing. Glacier tourism can be seen as a mix between purchasable short-term holidays and gradually acquired life-time skill. This analysis focuses on five important preconditions for this adventure tourism niche, namely, natural resources, access, demand, entrepreneurship, and need for special competence. The study also provides insight into current and future challenges and perceived risks on three levels. Results indicate that glacier tourism is not dependent on large glaciers. Studying current companies' location shows there is room for expansion in terms of extensively using natural resources where there is demand. However, some entrepreneurs are sceptical of the industry's future as recent recession of the glaciers has made access more difficult.

AB  - Since education involves interrelationship and freedom, sharing and empowering through research, the project of full man education, namely mind, body and soul cannot be ignored by the exigencies of a modern and active school in the current socio-cultural dialogue. Teaching religion in the multilinguistic and multicultural context of the Romanian-Finnish School in Sibiu is a challenge that determines new research in the religious education field and methodology in order to optimize the teaching process. The class of spiritual and religious education aims to "befriend" child to himself as "homo religious", releasing him from the ideologizing his consciousness be it religious or of any other kind It also contributes to the moral, social and spiritual development of the child and prepares him/her for a responsible religious pluralism, offering an alternative to live the values of communication, communion, and spirit of justice, specific to the religious field. This study sums up the first three years experience of teaching religious education in the primary Finnish School of Sibiu and presents some of the findings of that period, during which we have been looking for an appropriate approach of religious education to respond both to the requirements of the child-centered educational vision of the Finnish School and the relationship between particularity and pluralism. The currently research is ongoing, since the cultural, linguistic and religious landscape of Finnish School in Sibiu has significantly changed in the present year.

AB  - The petroleum industry today are characterised by local companies emerging to other markets. This paper evaluates from cases the importance of these markets, and how many actually export to them. The offshore technology petroleum industry is one of Norway's largest industry sectors. The main competitive advantage of this sector is its knowledge base. An important part of the industry supplies platforms and other highly specialised equipment to the petroleum industry. Constraints to achieving success in these markets are many; official data may be unreliable, corruption might flourish, there will be large cultural differences and the political and legal risks might be high. Prejudice against different societies can also be an obstacle in creating and developing organizations that promote trade.

AB  - Natural resource management (NRM) increasingly relies on communicative measures to enable reframing in intractable conflicts. Reframing occurs when disputants change their perceptions of a conflict situation, and/or their preferences for dealing with it. However, the types of reframing possible, and the conditions under which they can occur, remain unclear. Through an inductive and longitudinal analysis of a mine establishment conflict in northern Sweden this paper explores to what extent, how, and under what conditions reframing can occur in intractable NRM conflicts. The findings reveal the difficulty in achieving consensus-oriented reframing. Despite multiple dispute resolution efforts, the disputants' perceptions and preferences became increasingly polarized. Nonetheless, the results suggest that it is possible to enable reframing to the extent that all disputants can understand and accept each other's different perceptions and positions, i.e., meta-consensus. Meta-consensus hinges on neutral, inclusive, equal, and deliberative intergroup communication. However, the results show that intergroup communication and reframing are significantly informed by institutional and other contextual factors. For example, when implemented within the formal governance system in the investigated case, intergroup communication lagged in quality and did not contribute to meta-consensus. Moreover, the results show that reframing is strongly influenced by the nature of the disputed issues, actors' group commitments, and the governance system's distribution of power to the actors. Based on these findings, it is argued that more efforts should focus on how governance systems can be configurated so that high-quality intergroup communication and meta-consensus can be enabled and inform decision making in intractable NRM conflicts.

AB  - Norway, the world's leader in the production and export of farmed Atlantic salmon, recently established a new management regime with a view to promoting substantial long-term growth in the industry. The government stated plainly, however, that the industry would have to be environmentally sustainable. The determination would be made through the use of indicators, but only one indicator would go into effect as the new regime was instituted: the amount of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on wild salmon. This paper asks why this one, lone variable was selected. Using policy documents, the draft white paper outlining the new management plan sent out for comment by the government and the responses made by key stakeholders to the draft plan, this paper argues that the selection of this one indicator was overdetermined. Many factors contributed to the selection, including the government's fundamental decision to expand production, the momentum of Norwegian policy development, how the draft white paper defined and discussed environmental sustainability, the criteria established for acceptable indicators and the specifics of the proposed management plan. These had a political effect: For these reasons and more, no solid block of stakeholders emerged to press unambiguously for additional indicators at the start of the scheme, merited or not. This study also demonstrates the difficulties presented by a public debate on a management plan such as this.

AB  - The species composition of macrofungal communities in 12 stands of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten.) across lowland England was assessed over three consecutive years, and related to stand structure and site characteristics. Results indicate that these plantations provide a habitat for diverse communities of macrofungi: a total of 343 species were recorded, of which 171 were found to be unique to pine, and 90 unique to spruce. The composition of these communities was found to differ markedly between forest areas and between plots within individual forests, with only three species common to all assessment plots. Calculation of Jaccard similarity coefficients indicated a 22-24% association between chronosequence stages in the two pine sites, and 20% in the two spruce sites. Fungi were classified into four functional groups based on their mode of nutrition: wood saprotrophs, litter saprotrophs, mycorrhizal and parasitic species. This enabled patterns of diversity to be related to stand structure and a range of site factors (based on soil chemical analyses). Positive relationships were recorded between increased volume of deadwood and the number of species of wood saprotrophs, and also between the species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the number of tree species present in each plot. Significant correlations were also recorded between the number of parasitic fungal species and soil pH (a positive response to increasing alkalinity), and between the number of litter colonizing saprotrophs and tree species richness. These results suggest that indicators of macrofungal diversity, based on relatively simple habitat assessments, could be developed for incorporation into forest management plans. These data also highlight the importance of maintaining adequate volumes of deadwood, and variety of tree species, permitting the development of diverse communities of macrofungi in forest stands; (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of sustainability (environmental, social and governance or ESG) practices on the financial performance (FP) of the Nordic financial industry. Design/methodology/approach The study covers a sample selection of observations for a total of 152 firm-years for 39 financial companies within the Nordic region (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway) for the business years including 2015-2019. Data regarding ESG and FP indicators were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database in July 2020. This is a quantitative study using regression and a generalized method of moments. Findings Using static and dynamic estimators, the authors found both positive and negative impacts of sustainability practice on FP. The authors identified a negative relationship between ESG practices and FP (return on invested capital, return on equity and earnings per share). The authors identified a positive relationship between governance and return on assets. Originality/value A key contribution to the accounting literature is the finding that there is a risk for financial firms in adopting sustainability practices, as they follow a logic that contradicts the purely economic rationale. On the other hand, the positive relationship between governance and FP helps not only companies but also regulators and researchers to understand the positive impact of a good governance structure.

AB  - Research on care managers' experiences of the needs assessment process is scarce even though the literature on needs assessment practice is relatively extensive. One of the research areas that has not received attention yet is the way in which care managers experience the challenges that are presumably posed by increased ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious diversity among prospective elder care recipients. This article addresses this research gap. It is based on a project that aims to shed light on care managers' experiences of the needs assessment process in general and cross-cultural needs assessment meetings in particular. The data are constituted of focus group interviews with care managers in Sweden (N=60). In this article we focus on care managers' experiences of needs assessment with older people who have immigrated late-in-life, who come from cultures considered different from the Swedish one and who have not mastered the Swedish language. This was the group of older people that the care managers mostly thought of when asked to describe their experiences of cross-cultural needs assessment meetings. The interviewed care managers discussed the challenges that these meetings present, which were related to communication due to language barriers, different demands and expectations, insecurity regarding what is customary in such meetings, as well as perceived passivity among late-in-life immigrants. The article discusses the contributions of the findings to research on care management practices in general, as well as to needs assessment practice in particular.

AB  - Sweden, with a population of less than 1.5 million people, rose from relative obscurity to the most powerful state in northern Europe in the period 1560 to 1720. Her natural resources were efficiently exploited for export production of copper, steel and tar for which Sweden had a dominant position on the world market. This export provided the financial means for an aggressive policy and made it possible for Sweden to sustain almost uninterrupted warface for more than a century. Key factors were the very favourable spatial availability of ore, waterpower and forest but also the state plan and control of metal production based on a sustainable utilization of the forests. In the light of the historical development in Europe, Sweden's production basis and the way it was gouverned is analysed. A comparison is made with Switzerland, a nation with about the same population, but lacking exploitable resources, except people and cattle. In the next issue of this journal a system overview will be presented using energy, not money, as scale on the exchange in the mid-17th century between Sweden and the rest of Europe by the trade and by the military operations. Such a biophysical approach throws light on the role of energy and forest for wealth and power.

AB  - The importance and purpose of heritage preservation have been extensively discussed in tourism research and has also been linked with regional and national development strategies. Because of time degradation, human activities, and the overcrowding effect, heritage preservation and reconstruction efforts are becoming critical to ensure the sustainability of heritage sites and disseminate the history and the potential of a region or a country. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offer useful applications in heritage preservation. This study aims to explore the potential of these interactive technologies to be applied in heritage preservation in Africa, introduce strategies and applications developed Egypt and Tunis but also from Oman, and Finland, and highlight their impact in regional and national socio-economic development. As members of the Time Machine Europe this paper analyzes previous experiences in global scale and aim is to contribute in large-scale digitalization projects in Europe but also world-wide.

AB  - Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is a widely accepted approach for sustainable management of the coastal environment. ICZM emphasizes integration across sectors, levels of government, uses, stakeholders, and spatial and temporal scales. While improving integration is central to progress in ICZM, the role of and the achievement of integration remain understudied. To further study these two points, our research analyzes the performance of specific mechanisms used to support ICZM in eight countries (Belgium, India, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, UK, and Vietnam). The assessment is based on a qualitative comparative analysis conducted through the use of two surveys. It focuses on five ICZM mechanisms (environmental impact assessment; planning hierarchy; setback lines; marine spatial planning, and regulatory commission) and their role in improving integration. Our findings indicate that certain mechanisms enhance specific types of integration more effectively than others. Environmental impact assessment enhances science-policy integration and can be useful to integrate knowledge across sectors. Planning hierarchy and regulatory commissions are effective mechanisms to integrate policies across government levels, with the latter also promoting public-government integration. Setback lines can be applied to enhance integration across landscape units. Marine spatial planning is a multi-faceted mechanism with the potential to promote all types of integration. Policy-makers should adopt the mechanisms that are suited to the type of integration needed. Results of this study also contribute to evidence-based coastal management by identifying the most common impediments related to the mechanisms of integration in the eight studied countries.

AB  - Monitoring whale strandings are a key aspect of ecosystem management as stranded animals can provide indications on ecosystem health, pollution and adverse effects due to anthropogenic activities. Most mass mortality events are reported for toothed whales and rarely involve baleen whales. In the course of one month in spring 2020, 17 whales belonging to seven different species, stranded on the shores of Northern Norway, above the Arctic circle. This multi-species event included humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), that were accompanied by northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), a white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), a long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) and a harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). We discuss some potential causes of death based on the previous literature and available information for the area, highlighting the need for further investigation on cetacean strandings at high latitudes. Ultimately, the reasons for the stranding could only be identified by a thorough examination of all the animals, which was unfortunately not conducted. As the threats to polar ecosystems and access to local shores are likely to increase, reports of cetacean mortality are also expected to surge, particularly in high latitude regions where climate variations and anthropogenic activities are increasing. This study makes recommendations for future steps and considerations for monitoring networks and standardized sampling methods for future marine mammal stranding events. Finally, we suggest that national and international efforts based on the collaborative relationships are implemented, considering the multiple facets of animal ecology and health as an achievable step in the near future.

AB  - Why do group differences in landscape assessment exist? In the present paper, we explore the hypothesis that landscape preferences are associated with people's environmental value orientations, operationalised according to Thompson and Barton's [J. Environ, Psychol. 14 (1994) 199] distinctions between anthropocentric, ecocentric, and apathetic orientations toward the environment. Preferences for local landscapes and environmental value orientations were surveyed in a sample of the adult population of Roros, southern Norway. The highest preference was expressed for wildland scenes containing water, followed by cultural landscapes and traditional farm environments. Landscapes with elements of modern agricultural practises were the least preferred category. Significant positive correlations were found between the ecocentric environmental value orientation and a preference for wildlands with water, and for cultural landscapes. The anthropocentric value orientation correlated positively with a preference for farm environments, while environmental apathy was negatively associated with a preference for wildlands and cultural landscapes. The respondents agreed to ecocentric, but were neutral to anthropocentric statements. The findings indicate that the majority of the people in the area should be responsive to ecocentric arguments when development and conservation plans are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Investment in cultural heritage (and other forms of culture) are often claimed to be beneficial for a local economy, not only in terms of cultural consumption, but also in the form of increased employment and income. This article addresses some methodological questions regarding economic impact studies of investments in cultural heritage projects. Different types of direct and indirect impacts are being discussed, especially how these can be calculated. We also give a short overview over some studies of economic impact of different cultural and/or tourism activities, and the pros and cons of these studies. In a study of the Norwegian town of Roros, we find that tourism related to the cultural heritages in the region contribute some 7 per cent to overall employment and income.

AB  - In this study we measure urbanization based on a diverse set of 21 variables ranging from landscape indices to demographic factors such as income and land ownership using data from Stockholm, Sweden. The primary aims were to test how the variables behaved in relation to each other and if these patterns were consistent across scales. The variables were mostly identified from the literature and limited to the kind of data that was readily accessible. We used GIS to sample the variables and then principal component analyses to search for patterns among them, repeating the sampling and analysis at four different scales (250 x 250, 750 x 750, 1,250 x 1,250 and 1,750 x 1,750, all in meters). At the smallest scale most variables seemed to be roughly structured along two axes, one with landscape indices and one mainly with demographic factors but also impervious surface and coniferous forest. The other land-cover types did not align very well with these two axes. When increasing the scale this pattern was not as obvious, instead the variables separated into several smaller bundles of highly correlated variables. Some pairs or bundles of variables were correlated on all scales and thus interchangeable while other associations changed with scale. This is important to keep in mind when one chooses measures of urbanization, especially if the measures are indices based on several variables. Comparing our results with the findings from other cities, we argue that universal gradients will be difficult to find since city shape and size, as well as available information, differ greatly. We also believe that a multivariate gradient is needed if you wish not only to compare cities but also ask questions about how urbanization influences the ecological character in different parts of a city.

AB  - While our knowledge on the form and functioning of networks increases, we have little knowledge on the effects of network context on the impact of governance networks. This study focuses on contextual elements and their effect on perceived network outcomes on three dimensions - service provision, solving "wicked" problems, and exerting external influence - controlling for trust and consensus. Data from 11 governance networks in Norway are combined with individual data on trust, consensus and outcomes. Results indicate that contextual factors have significant effects on network outcomes, particularly on the ability to solve complex problems and on external influence. Possible mechanisms are discussed, and implications for future studies of governance networks are outlined.

T2  - CONSERVING CULTURAL HERITAGE
LA  - English
CP  - 3rd International Congress on Science and Technology for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage (Technoheritage)
AB  - In Norway, studies from Heritage at Risk have shown that up to 1% of the historic buildings constructed prior to 1900 are lost every year. At this rate of loss, the cultural heritage of the country will be at increasing risk over the near future. Therefore, it is of critical importance to plan maintenance and adaptation interventions for this category of building. The level and choice of interventions is a complex subject because it should retain the functionality of the building but at the same time avoid the unnecessary replacement of historic fabric by ensuring principles of compatibility, reversibility and retreat-ability. Within these boundaries, interventions can also achieve sustainable targets by taking into account the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the conception phase to the implementation of adaptation plan.
   The purpose of the present work is to overcome the collaboration difficulties among the groups associated with heritage conservation through the definition of an integrated Zero Emission Refurbishment (ZER) methodology that includes all the necessary steps from study to practice. The work aims to provide an effective tool for the process of cultural heritage preservation, with the goal to select the most suitable intervention by taking into account quality and environmental impact of the action. It incorporates current studies carried out in Norway in the refurbishment strategies of existing buildings and aims to identify and resolve research needs to enhance sustainable interventions at European level for reaching the ZER target.

AB  - In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey - the roe deer - and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (1997-2006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.

AB  - Aims: In this study, the aim was to develop and test an urban green space indicator for public health, as proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, in order to support health and environmental policies. Methods: We defined the indicator of green space accessibility as a proportion of an urban population living within a certain distance from a green space boundary. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based method and tested it in three case studies in Malmo, Sweden; Kaunas, Lithuania; and Utrecht, The Netherlands. Land use data in GIS from the Urban Atlas were combined with population data. Various population data formats, maximum distances to green spaces, minimum sizes of green spaces, and different definitions of green spaces were studied or discussed. Results: Our results demonstrated that with increasing size of green space and decreased distance to green space, the indicator value decreased. As compared to Malmo and Utrecht, a relatively bigger proportion of the Kaunas population had access to large green spaces, at both shorter and longer distances. Our results also showed that applying the method of spatially aggregated population data was an acceptable alternative to using individual data. Conclusions: Based on reviewing the literature and the case studies, a 300 m maximum linear distance to the boundary of urban green spaces of a minimum size of 1 hectare are recommended as the default options for the indicator. The indicator can serve as a proxy measure for assessing public accessibility to urban green spaces, to provide comparable data across Europe and stimulate policy actions that recognise the importance of green spaces for sustainable public health.

AB  - Cattle veterinarians have long been encouraged to take on a role as proactive health consultants. How-ever, the process so far has been slow in Sweden and elsewhere, and only a rather small proportion of cattle work conducted by veterinarians involves vet-erinary herd health management (VHHM). The aims of this exploratory study were to explore Swedish cattle veterinarians' interpretation of VHHM services and to understand the factors that might affect the extent to which cattle veterinarians perform VHHM. Six focus group discussions with cattle veterinarians complemented with 5 individual telephone interviews with clinic managers were conducted in 2020. In total, 33 cattle veterinarians participated, all employed by the largest employer of Swedish cattle veterinarians: Distriktsveterinarerna (Swedish Board of Agriculture). Participants were chosen from 6 geographical regions with the aim to present variations in gender, age, coun-try of education, proportion of dairy cattle work at the clinic, experience in the veterinary profession, and ex-perience in work with dairy herds and in VHHM. The focus group discussions and interviews were recorded and these recordings were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Participants interpreted VHHM as work associated with the process of advising and included both ad hoc advising and more strategic forms of ser-vices. Prebooked visits per se were not seen as VHHM. We identified 4 different themes among the factors af-fecting the extent of VHHM services: (1) farmer trust and demand; (2) veterinary competence; (3) time avail-able for VHHM; and (4) the individual veterinarian's commitment and motivation. To gain farmers' trust and to create a demand for VHHM services, the results of VHHM work and the veterinarian's competence were deemed central by the participants. The veterinarians' skills in communication and relation building were considered especially important. Some farmers were perceived as having little interest in, or lacking deeper knowledge about, VHHM services. The promotion of VHHM services was mentioned as an important fac-tor to increase farmer demand. Participants described VHHM as work demanding high skills and continuous capacity development. Veterinarians' personal commit-ment and motivation were also described as important for the extent to which VHHM services were performed. This was in turn affected by the psychosocial work environment (e.g., workload, interest and recognition from farmers and managers, and acceptance, priority, and support by colleagues and managers). Clinic man-agers had a central role in the extent to which VHHM services are offered by an individual veterinarian due to their responsibility for staff scheduling, which highly affects the conditions for capacity development, inter-collegiate networking, and cooperation. Lack of time was a major barrier for VHHM. On-call duty time and subsequent compensatory leave affected the total time available, and participants described time conflicts between VHHM and emergency services; moreover, it was perceived as challenging to find sufficient time for capacity development in several different species for veterinarians working in mixed practice. The slow de-velopment toward more proactive approaches for cattle veterinarians can be explained by the numerous dif-ferent factors that together constrain the veterinarian to the traditional role of diagnosing and treating sick animals.

AB  - In Scandinavia, dendrochronological reconstructions of past climate have mostly been based on tree-ring data from forests in which there has been, supposedly, very little or no human impact. However, human land use in sub-alpine forests has a substantially longer history and more profound effects on the forest ecosystems than previously acknowledged. Therefore, to assess human influence on tree-ring patterns over the last 500 yr, we have analyzed tree-ring patterns using trees from 2 abandoned Sami settlements and a reference site with no human impact-all situated in the Tjeggelvas Nature Reserve in north-west Sweden. The hypothesis was that land use legacies have affected tree-ring patterns, and in turn, the resulting palaeoclimate inferences that have been made from these patterns. Our results show that climate signals are strongest at the reference site and weakest at one of the settlement sites. From the 1940s to the present, tree growth at this settlement site has been significantly lower than at the reference site. Lower tree growth at old settlements may have resulted from rapid changes in the traditional land use, or following the abrupt change when the settlements were abandoned. Without site-specific know ledge of past land use, there is a high risk of accidently sampling trees that have been affected by human-induced disturbances in the past. This may create bias in the climate signals inferred from such trees, and hence bias the outcome of climate reconstructions. We therefore recommend sampling several separate sites in study areas to improve the robustness of inferences.

AB  - Temporal patterns of biodiversity are often difficult to interpret because of our limited under-standing of how communities vary through time and how processes drive this variation. A further challenge with dynamic systems is choosing an appropriate baseline against which biodiversity change is judged. We used abundance time series of breeding waterbirds in eutrophic lakes in Finland for 1946-2022 to study the dynamics of biodiversity change in local communities and the relative role of two presumed main drivers, i.e. eutrophication and alien predators, in contrib-uting to historical and recent trends in local abundances and biodiversity. We set the cut-off for the historical and recent study periods in the mid-1980 s, because the systematic monitoring of breeding waterbirds in Finland started in 1986 and recent analyses of biodiversity change and population trends in European boreal waterbird communities are mainly based on time series and data gathered since 1986. Both species richness and the total abundance of waterbirds in local communities showed contrasting trends between historical (gathered before the mid-1980 s) and current (gathered after the mid-1980 s) community time series, with the current time series indicating a decline and the historical time series indicating an increase. The abundances of habitat specialists (species preferring eutrophic lakes) and habitat generalists (species using both eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes) showed a corresponding difference between the current and historical time series. The local extinction rates were higher among habitat specialists than among habitat generalists. The trend indices for wetland-nesting species (highly vulnerable to predation by two alien species (the raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, and American mink, Neovison vison) in terms of nest site) abundances were more negative than the trend indices of species nesting further away from waterbodies (less vulnerable to predation by two alien species). In addition, bottom-feeding species (presumably more sensitive to negative impacts of eutrophica-tion) did not show more negative population trends than surface-feeding species (presumably less sensitive to negative impacts of eutrophication). Regardless of equal sensitivity to negative im-pacts of eutrophication, two species highly vulnerable to two alien predators showed more negative population trends than a less vulnerable species. The results suggest that increased predation has been an important driver of the population and biodiversity declines in the studied waterbird communities. The mid-1980 s may not provide an ecologically appropriate baseline against which changes in the populations and biodiversity of boreal waterbird communities are judged.

AB  - Tree species influence the chemical properties of the organic horizon and mineral soil. Microbial communities, including fungi and bacteria, which are the main drivers of nutrient cycles in forest soils, may be affected by tree species via litter chemical properties and root exudation. Therefore, conversion from natural forest to plantation could affect the microbial communities. Here, we aimed to reveal the effects of conversion from natural forest to coniferous plantation on soil microbial community structure, biodiversity, and co-occurrence networks, as well as soil chemical properties. For this purpose, we investigated chemical and microbial properties of the organic horizon and mineral topsoil (0-10 cm depth) in three forest types (a natural forest dominated by broad-leaved deciduous trees, and two types of plantations). Forest type had significant effects on chemical properties, including the C/N ratio, pH, and dissolved inorganic N of the organic horizon, while it had no significant effect on the chemical properties of topsoil, except for microbial biomass N and C. Microbial community structures in both the organic horizon and topsoil differed significantly among forest types and with changes in soil properties such as pH and C/N ratio. Microbial diversity indices did not significantly differ among forest types in either layer, while the microbial co-occurrence networks in the mineral soil of the natural forest were more complex and robust than the networks of plantations. Therefore, our results showed that conversion from natural forest to coniferous plantation could affect soil chemical properties and microbial community structure in the organic horizon, and the microbial co-occurrence network in the mineral topsoil; these impacts may vary according to the planted tree species.

AB  - Farmed salmon has become an important export commodity for many countries and regions. The expanding salmon aquaculture industry has, due to its rapid increase, resulted in environmental concerns, most notably relating to the interaction with wildlife, effects of effluents and discharges in local ecosystems, in some regions overuse of antibiotics and development of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and high dependence on fish resources in feeds. As a response to these concerns, the industry has strengthened their efforts to improve practices and private led sustainability initiatives, including certification and eco-labelling, has become increasingly important. This study examines the differences between salmon farming governance policies in the four largest salmon producing regions; Norway, Chile, Scotland (UK) and British Columbia (Canada) and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council's (ASC) salmon standard. The purpose of the study is to clarify how the standard from a well-established eco-certification program compares to national or regional conventional standards, using additionality as measuring method. The paper concludes that at present the ASC standard has mainly three strong advantages over existing regional/national standards and these relate to; escape numbers allowed, antibiotic usage and fish resources in feed. Changing these three main divergences in the national/regional regulations would significantly improve some of the main sustainability issues with uncertified salmon fanning. The study also finds that the potential additionality of the ASC standard can differ between regions, with the highest difference in Chile and lowest in Norway.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pious sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula) are the major tree species grown in Finnish forest nurseries where 99% of the seedlings are grown in containers first in plastic-covered greenhouses and later outdoors. The main diseases on conifer seedlings are Scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina), Sirococcus blight and cankers (Sirococcus conigenum), snow blights (Herpotrichia juniperi and Phacidium infestans) and needle casts (Lophodermium seditiosum and Meria laricis). Also grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) and birch rust (Melampsoridium betulinum) are among the diseases to be controlled with fungicides. During last years Scleroderris canker has been a problem on Norway spruce, which has been since 2000 the most common species produced in Finnish nurseries. Root die-back (uninucleate Rhizoctonia sp.) on container-grown spruce and pine was a problem in the 1990s. Today the disease has become less common in modern nurseries due to improvements in hygiene and cultivation practice. Since 1991 stem lesions and top dying caused by Phytopinhom cactorum has been a problem on birch. The ongoing climate change has already had effect on rusts and powdery mildews as well as other fungi infecting leaves. All diseases, which gain high precipitation and warm and long autumns. For same reasons winter stored seedlings need sprayings against grey mold. Fungal infections are also possible during short-day (SD) treatment, that is necessary for summer and autumn plantings and a beneficial step prior freezing temperatures outside or in freezer storage. Growers are encouraged to use cultural and integrated pest management techniques such as better nursery hygiene, including removing plant debris in nursery growing areas and hot water washing of containers plus removal of diseased, spore-producing seedlings and trees around the nursery.

AB  - Wind power projects frequently face public opposition during the siting process. A deeper understanding of social factors has therefore been called for. Based on psychological theories, the present research was initiated in order to study the relative importance of individual aspects related to visual perception and attitudinal factors in public intention to oppose local wind turbines. In an empirical study, 80 people assessed the visual characteristics of wind turbines on site and rated their emotional state. They also completed a questionnoire covering attitudes towards the turbines, perception of significant others'opinions of local wind turbines, and perceived possibilities to oppose as well as intention to oppose local turbines. Moreover, socio-demographics, factors related to the place of residence and general attitude towards wind power, were investigated. In a multiple regression analysis explaining 50% of the variance, it was found that intention to oppose was related to only a few perceptual and attitudinal factors, i.e. the perceived unity of the environment, the personal attitude towards the effects of wind turbines on landscape aesthetics and recreation, and the general attitude towards wind power. Of minor importance was the attitude towards the effects of wind turbines on people's daily quality of life. It seems important to involve the public in the discussion of how wind power installations can be integrated into the landscape without threatening the visual beauty and the recreational value of the natural and cultural environment. Moreover, social intervention is required to promote positive attitudes towards wind turbines. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We examined 15 criteria used for selection of 1175 natural areas protected by the Swedish Nature Conservation Act We categorized criteria as "scientific," having botanical ornithological, and geological values, or "political," having human-oriented recreational, landscape, and cultural values. On average, 2.3 criteria were used per protected area, and number of criteria increased with size of area The six major criteria in order of use were: recreational, botanical, landscape, geological, ornithological, and cultural values. Political criteria were as important as scientific ones for protection of Swedish nature. There were only minor historical changes in use of different criteria, except that recreational values increased strongly from 1965 to 1975. The average and median size of protected areas increased from 1960 onwards. Areas of recreational value were more common close to the three largest cities and were often large, areas of botanical value were often small Areas of recreational or ornithological value were associated with lakes and the coast; areas of botanical and landscape value were associated with mountains and farmland. An ordination of areas with two or more criteria showed associations within the group of political and within the group of scientific criteria Political criteria may be important in or close to populated areas during periods when urbanization and leisure increase, nationally, we plead for emphasis on biological criteria in future selection of protected areas.

AB  - Retention forestry involves saving important forest structures for flora and fauna during the final felling of a stand, including dead wood and variable amounts of living trees, i.e. green tree retention (GTR). Here we evaluate the long-term effects on avian diversity from GTR by surveying forest birds in 32 mid-rotation stands in southern Sweden, in which broadleaf GTR was present or absent. Complementing the many studies that have assessed GTR in clear-cuts, our results indicated that bird assemblages can also benefit from broadleaf GTR several decades after final felling in conifer dominated production stands. The GTR stands harboured a higher bird abundance and species richness than the control stands without GTR, and also appears to have benefited several important guilds, such as broadleaf-associated birds and cavity nesters. However, variation in the number trees retained, the species composition of retained trees, and their environmental context within the stand (e.g. density and proximity of surrounding production trees), limited our capacity to detect threshold requirements for GTR. In summary, our study provides a "glimpse into the future" as mid-rotation production stands with such old and large retained trees are unusual in today's landscape, but are expected to become more common in the decades to come, in Sweden and many other nations. Our study thereby provides provisional support for the continued and future use of this practice, and indicates that the biodiversity contribution of retention trees continues to occur several decades into the stand's rotation.

AB  - We studied the distribution and the reproductive success of the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and the redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus in relation to forest patch size, edge type (clearcut vs natural), distance from the forest edge, and vegetation characteristics in a forest-dominated landscape. Breeding performances were recorded in up to 72 forest patches during 1992-1994 for birds breeding in nest-boxes. In the spring, breeding individuals of both species arrived earlier in large forest patches ( >1 ha) than in smaller ones. Pied flycatchers arrived earlier on clearcut edges than natural edges but in the redstart there was no preference for a particular edge type. The territory distance from the forest to open land edge did not affect the arrival dates of either species. In the case of the pied flycatcher, the proportion of unpaired males was highest in patches <1 ha in size and in the case of the redstart this applied to patches < 5 ha in size. Pairing success was not related to the forest edge type or the nest's distance from the edge. Nest predation was not patch-size nor edge-related for either of the species, but in the combined data for both species nest predation was higher at clearcut edges than at natural edges. Clutch size, brood size and the survival of nestlings to the fledgling stage (fledgling/egg, %) were independent of the patch size, edge type and nest's distance from the forest edge.

AB  - In this note we provide preliminary empirical evidence on Norwegian alpine skiers' willingness-to-pay for season pass attributes that make alpine skiing more sustainable. We focus on two key attributes; (1) compensating for the CO2 emissions associated with the activity by purchasing CO2 quotas and (2) compulsory use of public transportation to/from the ski resort. The results show that there is a substantial interest in season passes that includes CO2 compensation. However, combining season passes with compulsory use of public transportation (ski bus) does not seem to be attractive to Norwegian alpine skiers/snowboarders. The optimal prices of the two alternatives are approximately 11.5% higher (CO2 version) and 25% lower (ski bus version) when compared to a regular season pass.

AB  - Using the Foucauldian theoretical framework of governmentality, this paper examines the role of regulative 'technologies of government' in climate change adaptation. The paper examines such technologies and underlying rationalities in a multi-level context, in three European countries that represent different stages of adaptation policy development: the UK, Finland and Sweden. Drawing upon policy documents and interviews at different levels, the paper illustrates differences in technologies of government for adaptation between the relatively 'regulative' UK state system and Finland and Sweden's traditional legalistic and welfarist systems. The study illustrates that, while the treatment of adaptation as an issue on a national level coheres with national rationalities, local and regional levels show a diversity in the development of bottom-up adaptation technologies.

AB  - Introduction. This research in progress explores women refugees' information and integration challenges from the cultural perspective and proposes the concept of `cultural landscape' as facilitator to refugees' information and integration practices in Sweden.
   Method. A qualitative research method of participatory observation, semi-structured interviews and unofficial discussions as a complement is been used in this study.
   Analysis. The thematic analysis approach is used to analyse the observation and interviews data.
   Results. Participants describe how two 'doing and learning circles' have helped them in reconstructing fractured information landscapes by building bridges into new communities, maintaining links with cocultural community network and achieving a sense of belonging and identity by psychological and spiritual support.
   Conclusions. The research will identify the importance of cultural landscape in meeting refugees' information and integration challenges in a new country.

AB  - Cold environments at high elevation and high latitude are often viewed as resistant to biological invasions. However, climate warming, land use change and associated increased connectivity all increase the risk of biological invasions in these environments. Here we present a summary of the key discussions of the workshop 'Biosecurity in Mountains and Northern Ecosystems: Current Status and Future Challenges' (Flen, Sweden, 1-3 June 2015). The aims of the workshop were to (1) increase awareness about the growing importance of species expansion-both non-native and native-at high elevation and high latitude with climate change, (2) review existing knowledge about invasion risks in these areas, and (3) encourage more research on how species will move and interact in cold environments, the consequences for biodiversity, and animal and human health and wellbeing. The diversity of potential and actual invaders reported at the workshop and the likely interactions between them create major challenges for managers of cold environments. However, since these cold environments have experienced fewer invasions when compared with many warmer, more populated environments, prevention has a real chance of success, especially if it is coupled with prioritisation schemes for targeting invaders likely to have greatest impact. Communication and co-operation between cold environment regions will facilitate rapid response, and maximise the use of limited research and management resources.

AB  - Nowadays in Europe, the production of advanced biofuels represents a very important objective, given the strong interest in increasing sustainability throughout the transport sector. Production and availability of advanced biofuels are cited as a relevant issue in the most important international actions, such as the Sustainable Development Goals in UN Agenda 2030, EU RED II, and EU Mission Innovation 4, to cite a few of them. However, an important aspect to be considered is the prediction of feedstocks availability to produce advanced biofuel. The first aim of this paper is to assess the availability of European agricultural residues, forestry residues, and biogenic wastes in 2025. The data were collected through a deep review on open FAOSTAT and EUROSTAT databases and then elaborated by the authors. The analysis focuses on the fraction of feedstocks that can be used for advanced biofuels production, i.e., incorporating specific information on sustainable management practices, competitive uses, and environmental risks to preserve soil quality. An autoregressive model is developed to predict future availability, while also considering corrections due to the current pandemic. The results suggest that several European countries could produce enough sustainable advanced feedstocks to meet the European binding target. In particular, France, Germany, and Romania will have high production of agricultural feedstocks; while Austria, Finland, and Sweden will be rich of forestry residues; finally, Italy, France, and United Kingdom will have the highest availability of wastes. To complete the picture, a proper metric is introduced, aiming at generating a technology ranking of the examined alternative fuels, in terms of several relevant parameters such as biomass availability, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), quality of the biofuel, and costs. This analysis allows us to compare advanced biofuels and first-generation biofuels, whose utilization can impact the food market, while also contributing to the increase in the indirect land use change (ILUC). Although the first-generation biofuels remain the most common choice, the renewable (or green) diesel, pyrolysis bio-oil, green jet fuel, and the second-generation bioethanol are promising for different applications in the transport sector. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Anaerobic Digestion (AD), and transesterification from vegetable oil represent the most widespread and mature technologies. Thus, it seems mandatory that the transport sector will rely more and more on such fuels in the future. For such reason, a specific support for advanced biomass collection, as well as specific programs for conversion technologies development, are strongly suggested.

AB  - The regulation of aquaculture production in Norway considers the potential impact of salmon lice on wild fish. However, most attention has been focused on impacts on wild Atlantic salmon, despite the fact that anadromous brown trout spend the majority of their marine phase in coastal waters, where salmon lice have the highest impact. In the present study, we first suggest changes in marine living area and marine feeding time as sustainability indicators for first-time migrant sea trout, as high salmon lice densities may exclude sea trout from otherwise usable habitat and force them to return early to freshwater. Further, a method based on a bio-hydrodynamic model was developed to serve as a proxy for these indicators. The method accounted for the size, migration timing and spatial extent of sea trout and was demonstrated in 2 Norwegian salmon aquaculture production areas, Hardangerfjord (PO3) and Romsdalsfjord (PO5), and 2 focal rivers from within each fjord. Based on these comparisons, we exemplify how the change in marine living area and marine feeding time differed between PO3 and PO5 and within the areas. Sea trout migrating to sea late (June 5) were always more affected by lice than those migrating early (April 24) or at intermediate dates (May 15). Our estimates revealed dramatic potential impacts of salmon lice on sea trout populations, which were greatly influenced by spatial and temporal aspects. Considering the negative impacts of salmon lice on sea trout, a holistic view of environmental interactions between aquaculture and wild species that depend on habitats exploited for production is necessary.

AB  - The achievement of a radical global reduction of greenhouse gases requires a legal-institutional setting capable of facilitating such a transition on a wide range of renewable technologies. This paper identifies and critically evaluates the key institutional, procedural and substantive legal mechanisms facilitating or preventing sustainable production of blue renewable energy with Finland as a case study country. The focus is on offshore wind power and hydropower. While we approach energy transition from the perspective of an EU member state, we simultaneously shed light on the relevant parts of the EU legal framework that significantly affect national legal frameworks.

AB  - Political ecology, as a perspective for exploring power-permeated socio-ecological transformations, has to date rarely engaged with tourism. Neither has tourism theory, with some notable exceptions, engaged much with political ecology. In this article, I argue that the resultant lack of dialogue between these signifies a loss for political ecology and tourism theory alike, but also that current conceptualisations of tourism have much to offer for instigating a dialogue. Combining social-constructivist, political economy oriented and Actor Network-Theory conceptualisations of tourism with political ecology work, I account for the establishment of Bro Hof Slott Golf Club in Upplands-Bro, northwest of Sweden's capital. Here, immense investments have transformed shorelines into a meticulously maintained upscale golf landscape. But the development simultaneously sparked new future visions for what Upplands-Bro could become and conflicts concerning whether the development breached local plans, thereby illuminating the political nature of tourist-oriented environmental transformation.

AB  - Biofuel production and land seizure in Africa has come under the spotlight recently. Ghana is a case in point. Lands taken by multinational companies for biofuel production are common. A total of 769,000 hectares of land has been acquired by foreign companies like Agroils (Italy), Galten Global Alternative Energy (Israel), Gold Star Farms (Ghana), Jatropha Africa (UK/Ghana), Biofuel Africa (Norway), ScanFuel (Norway) and Kimminic Corporation (Canada). Research indicates that Ghana has 3.99 million hectares of arable land and 2,075,000 hectares of permanent culture. This means that more than 37 % of arable land in Ghana is used for the cultivation of Jatropha.
   The research analysed specific areas of biofuel production such as the Ahanta in the Western Region, Pru in Brong Ahafo and Offinso in the Ashanti Region in Ghana. We will explore the implications of land use changes as well as the climate mitigation potential of biofuels.

T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY

KW  - CANIS-LUPUS
KW  - COORDINATION
KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - A new structure for decision-making in relation to management of large carnivores is presently being implemented in Sweden through a system of regional Wildlife Management Delegations (WMD). The governing idea is that strengthened regional influence will increase the legitimacy of both the management system and its outcomes. We use this institutional change as a backdrop for analyzing the possibilities to apply deliberative practices to reduce conflict and enhance legitimacy in the management of natural resources. We argue that structures alone do not determine the prospects of deliberative arrangements; the political context (i.e. the characteristics and relationships among participating actors) is equally important. An analytical framework is proposed that merges structural prospects for deliberation in co-management with stakeholder features, capturing the interests and beliefs of the actors involved. We illustrate the application of this framework by analysing original data from three Wildlife Management Delegations. Our findings show that there are significant differences in the beliefs among the actors within the system. Based on similarities in their beliefs, they can potentially form a relatively strong anti-carnivore/pro-WMD-coalition, opposing the pro-carnivore/anti-WMD-beliefs of the nature conservation interest. Furthermore, the structure is designed to meet vital deliberative criteria, yet we point at substantial differences between statutory and effective representation that, as it coincides with diverging beliefs, can affect decision-making. One qualitative criterion for successful deliberation stands out in our study - reasoned debate. The prospects for deliberation in WMDs to reduce conflict levels among opposing interests seem to depend on the capacity for ensuring exchange of reasonable and informed arguments.

AB  - This paper seeks to provide deeper insights into how EA ineffectiveness is produced in land use planning practice. This is explored in a study of local development planning in the city of Vasteras, Sweden. The case in question is the development of a large out-of-town shopping centre, propelled by the establishment of a new IKEA furniture store. The Healey (2007) framework of planning as strategy making is applied as an analytical framework, together with a focus on power-knowledge relations. In the analysis, we identify a range of mechanisms that produced ineffectiveness by limiting the role of environmental knowledge throughout the planning process. The specific mechanisms we identified were related to the overall consensus perspective in local development strategies and plans, a lack of concretisation and integration of various policies and strategies, a range of exclusion mechanisms and an overall focus on mitigation and benefits of the process in question. In practice, these mechanisms were closely intertwined. Our main conclusion is, consequently, that increased effectiveness of EA would require fundamental transformation of the norms, frameworks and routines that implicitly and explicitly guide land use planning in practice.

AB  - Global energy demand and scarce petroleum resources require communities to adapt to a rapidly changing Arctic environment, but as well to a transforming socio-economic environment instigated by oil and gas development. This is illustrated by liquefied natural gas production by Statoil at Hammerfest, which opened up the Barents Sea for oil and gas drilling. Although environmental organisations, Sarni indigenous people, fisheries and local inhabitants of Hammerfest try to strive for environmental and community development in relation to liquefied natural gas production by engaging in negotiations with Statoil and the Norwegian government, they are overshadowed by economic growth, implemented by a strong coalition between Statoil and the Norwegian State. Sustainable development of liquefied natural gas production is therefore constrained by centralized decision-making by the institutional coalition. Statoil's concessions on environmental and community development were rather based on cost-efficient and short-term means. This is strengthened by the fact that contact with stakeholders faded away once the social license to operate was achieved. This article will analyse why current governance of liquefied natural gas production at Hammerfest did not move beyond economic development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Concerns about loss of greenspace with urbanisation motivate much research on nature and health; however, contingency of greenspace-health associations on the character of community change remains understudied.
   Methods With aggregate data from governmental sources for 1432 Swedish parishes, we used negative binomial regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality during 2000-2008 in relation to percentage area (in 2000) of urban residential greenspace, urban parks and rural greenspace, looking across parishes with decrease, stability or increase in population density. We also assessed interactions between land use and population change.
   Results Parishes with >= 1 decile increase in population density had lower incidence of all-cause (IRR=0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95) and CVD mortality (IRR=0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.94) compared with parishes with stable populations. In stable parishes, all-cause mortality was lower with higher percentages of urban green (IRR=0.998, 95% CI 0.996 to 1.000) and rural green land uses (IRR=0.997, 95% CI 0.996 to 0.999). These results were inverted in densifying parishes; higher all-cause mortality attended higher initial percentages of urban (IRR=1.081, 95% CI 1.037 to 1.127) and rural greenspace (IRR=1.042, 95% CI 1.007 to 1.079) as measured in 2000. Similar associations held for CVD mortality.
   Conclusions More greenspace was associated with lower all-cause and CVD mortality in communities with relatively stable populations. In densifying communities, population growth per se may reduce mortality, but it may also entail harm through reductions in amount per capita and/or quality of greenspace.special-featureunlocked

AB  - Within the tourism industry, there is considerable focus on sustainable tourism and the fact that tourism service providers should be sustainable. One way for tourism service providers to address these issues and communicate their sustainability work is for instance through annual reports, sustainability reports and home pages. The aim with this study was therefore to explore and compare what kind of information concerning sustainability that Swedish tourism service providers present to stakeholders. A sustainability report is one way for tourism companies to be more legitimate and accountable toward their stakeholders. Data was collected from 60 tourism service providers (e.g. 20 hotels, 20 restaurants and 20 activity companies) in Sweden from their annual reports and sustainability reports as well as their home pages. They are large-sized tourism service providers with a yearly turnover of between 5 and 50 million euros. The result shows that very few companies make sustainability reports. There is also a difference between how and where they present their sustainability work. The companies often present more of their sustainability work on their homepage compared to in annual and sustainability reports. The conclusion is that hotels are more focused on environmental sustainability, restaurants are focused more on social sustainability and the activity companies have little information about their sustainability work.

AB  - This study explores factors affecting local actors' and citizens' attitudes to mineral exploration, and how attitudes to exploration relates to those of mining. The concept Social License to Explore (SLE), originating from Social License to Operate (SLO), is used to address the relationship between exploration companies and affected local communities. The study focuses on attitudes in three municipalities in northern Sweden and Finland and com-bines qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that local attitudes to mineral exploration and mining correlate strongly and are intimately linked. Perceptions of impacts, the permit process, and trust in government and company affect local attitudes, but company performance seems to be most important where trust was not established. We argue that values about nature, economy, and value-based development prefer-ences, are central as they shape local attitudes and perceptions of impacts and process. While company conduct and community engagement are within the control of companies, local values and development preferences are largely outside of their control. However, insights about contextual conditions shaping attitudes and values can be generalized and help companies make more informed decisions. Responsible target selection is a strategy within the control of the company which can help avoid intractable and costly conflicts.

AB  - The goal of forest policy is to enhance sustainable production of the material and immaterial benefits of forests to serve the needs of all citizens. A theoretical model for explaining the formation of legitimacy in a certain political sector was developed and empirically tested in the context of Finnish forest policy. Nationwide mail survey data was used to determine the differences in the perceptions of forest policy by Finnish forest owners and other citizens. The questionnaire measured the legitimacy of the forest policy, the acceptance of laws, the justice of the procedures, the fairness of power relations, the acceptance of forestry operations and the competence in forest policy issues. Overall legitimacy was evaluated positively, and the forest owners considered forest policy in general to be more acceptable than other citizens did. The most criticized aspects of forest policy were the justice of the procedures and the use of clearcutting. Procedural justice and acceptance of forestry operations were the strongest explanatory factors for the legitimacy. Acceptance of the power relations of different stakeholder groups explained legitimacy for non-owners but not for forest owners. In both groups, forest policy competence led to a more negative evaluation of legitimacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Discourse serves as a fundamental prerequisite for human action - as is displayed by the implementation in Swedish local spatial planning of the EU 'Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive' which forms the focus of this paper. The national Swedish SEA policy discourse, following from the EU Directive, presents a clear case of 'doublespeak'. The major mobilising metaphor emerging from the discourse analysis is the concept of efficiency backed by the pronouncement of continuity. Major benefits for local spatial planning are outlined while at the same time assurance is given that no new efforts or added costs are foreseen for the municipalities. The role of the SEA is downsized in relation to sustainable development and to the Environmental Impact Assessment of projects. In order to fully interrogate this debate the current paper combines a policy implementation approach with a discourse perspective.

AB  - The application of a methodology for integrated energy-emissions control planning in a large Swedish community is described. The procedural aspects of the methodology have been discussed elsewhere, the description therefore concentrates on the technical analysis of the community energy system and the joint tasks of developing this system and controlling the emissions from it. Examples of technical issues that have been investigated are: local electricity production through cogeneration, the impact on emissions and on the local electricity production of the introduction of natural gas, conflicts between cogeneration and heat production from municipal waste incineration and between cogeneration and energy conservation in areas with district heating, local emissions budgets accounting for the emissions associated with import and export of electricity to or from the community, and the effects of different emissions control policy instruments such as `bubbling' or emissions fees. The most important tool for the technical analysis is the IEA-MARKAL technical energy system model.

AB  - The Norwegian Parliament has recently carried out a motion for all Norwegian city regions to curb all growth in private car use and redirect urban travel into public transport, cycling and walking. The county of Rogaland has therefore devised a set of transport and mobility measures for the Stavanger city region, such as a bus rapid system, a cycle highway, toll ring roads, sustainable mobility strategies, but also increased road capacity. This paper examines some of the underlying geographic hypotheses of sustainable transport planning aiming at reduced private car use.
   The Stavanger city region is characterised by dispersed development and high levels of car ownership and use, as well as an affluent population. Work travel data is used to investigate geographic factors that are assumed to impact on travel behaviour, such as travel distance, centrality and proximity to public transport. The question is whether the local work travel behaviour confirms typical assumptions about transport-oriented development. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban travel choice and its factors, thus helping to optimise local government efforts to reduce car travel.

AB  - The importance of long-term historical information derived from paleoecological studies has long been recognized as a fundamental aspect of effective conservation. However, there remains some uncertainty regarding the extent to which paleoecology can inform on specific issues of high conservation priority, at the scale for which conservation policy decisions often take place. Here we review to what extent the past occurrence of three fundamental aspects of forest conservation can be assessed using paleoecological data, with a focus on northern Europe. These aspects are (1) tree species composition, (2) old/large trees and coarse woody debris, and (3) natural disturbances. We begin by evaluating the types of relevant historical information available from contemporary forests, then evaluate common paleoecological techniques, namely dendrochronology, pollen, macrofossil, charcoal, and fossil insect and wood analyses. We conclude that whereas contemporary forests can be used to estimate historical, natural occurrences of several of the aspects addressed here (e.g. old/large trees), paleoecological techniques are capable of providing much greater temporal depth, as well as robust quantitative data for tree species composition and fire disturbance, qualitative insights regarding old/large trees and woody debris, but limited indications of past windstorms and insect outbreaks. We also find that studies of fossil wood and paleoentomology are perhaps the most underutilized sources of information. Not only can paleoentomology provide species specific information, but it also enables the reconstruction of former environmental conditions otherwise unavailable. Despite the potential, the majority of conservation-relevant paleoecological studies primarily focus on describing historical forest conditions in broad terms and for large spatial scales, addressing former climate, land-use, and landscape developments, often in the absence of a specific conservation context. In contrast, relatively few studies address the most pressing conservation issues in northern Europe, often requiring data on the presence or quantities of dead wood, large trees or specific tree species, at the scale of the stand or reserve. Furthermore, even fewer examples exist of detailed paleoecological data being used for conservation planning, or the setting of operative restorative baseline conditions at local scales. If ecologist and conservation biologists are going to benefit to the full extent possible from the ever-advancing techniques developed by the paleoecological sciences, further integration of these disciplines is desirable.

AB  - This paper describes how different backcasting scenarios for developments beyond traditional GDP growth 2050, in Sweden may fulfil a climate goal corresponding to keeping global warming to a maximum 1.5 degrees C with 50% likelihood. This corresponds to a 92% decrease of greenhouse gas emissions from Swedish consumption from today's level. The four scenarios illustrate different strategies: 1) collaborative economy, 2) local self-sufficiency, 3) automation for quality of life and 4) circular economy in the welfare state. The aim is to further hone and quantify the scenario narratives with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions occurring as a result of Swedish consumption, both private and public. The results show that the climate target can be met in all scenarios but this requires radical sector-specific as well as general changes, including decarbonisation, technology development, increased efficiencies, innovative practices and reduced demand. The mix of these strategies varies for different sectors and different scenarios, but all are needed to reach the climate goals. As we assume that Sweden is fossil-free 2050, particular areas of attention are diets, travel, emission intensities in other countries and the level of imports. Potential implications for other environmental goals, land use and biodiversity as well as the potential magnitude of negative emissions technologies, although uncertain and limited, that could offset some additional greenhouse gas emissions are discussed.

AB  - This study demonstrates a need for landscape studies of urbanisation in which the slow process of ruination and reuse is considered. The paper argues that a focus on maintenance and repair facilitate symmetrical studies in which the dismantling of former uses and the establishment of new activities and regulations are examined as an incremental process. This is illustrated here using the case study of a contested development project at the fringe of town Skurup, Sweden. The study traces partial dependencies of past planning, arguing that current farms have been successively separated from their previous networks of farming and, in the process, have become entangled in a complex interdependency of urban growth strategies dating back to the 1970s. The case provides a richer understanding of the contested landscape; it demonstrates the insufficiency of new growth boundaries, but also the potential to re-assemble the place, whether for farming or sustainable urban development.

AB  - A commonly agreed methodology for weighting the relative importance of different environmental impacts in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is lacking, although it is becoming a typical phase in LCA. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) provides an avenue to develop weighting tools applicable in LCA. The purpose of this paper is to describe a process of assessing environmental impacts of two alternative raw materials and to present the problems related to it. A panel which includes experts in measuring the environmental impacts of biomass production was requested to identify and weight impact categories to assess environmental impacts of biomass production. The panelists identified new environmental impacts (such as biodiversity) not included to the standard LCA. The highest weights were given by the panelists to climate change, natural land use change and biodiversity. The environmental impacts were analyzed for four case biomass production chains producing biodiesel and pulp in Finland. In case chains, the raw material for biodiesel is Asian palm oil or Finnish rapeseed oil, while the raw material for pulp is South American eucalyptus or Finnish birch. The calculations of the LCA impacts were limited to the impact categories for which inventory data were available. In calculations, different types of normalization procedures were tested to receive information on their effects on the LCA results. According to the results, in some cases normalization have considerable impact on the magnitude of the results. In general, the results imply that biomass imported from developing countries has less environmental impacts compared to the local forest and field biomass produced in Finland. However, due to the several sources of uncertainties included in the results, they are only to be used for illustrative purposes. In the future, applying the MCDA in LCA may deepen the applicability of the analyses, if valid and reliable data is available. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most large rivers in northern Sweden are regulated to produce hydropower, with subsequent effects on flow dynamics and aquatic insect communities. Several studies have shown that aquatic and terrestrial systems are intimately connected via the export of emergent aquatic insects, but few have assessed how human modifications of aquatic habitats may influence this connection. We compared breeding success of the insectivorous Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca in near-riparian upland forests along two regulated and two free-flowing large rivers in northern Sweden over 3years. The regulated rivers showed lower aquatic insect export to the surroundings, as a consequence of regulation-induced loss of suitable aquatic insect habitats. Survival of Pied Flycatcher nestlings was 1015% greater along the free-flowing rivers. Females breeding near the free-flowing rivers also started egg-laying earlier and with greater synchrony than those at the regulated rivers, and showed a smaller decrease in weight during breeding than did females along the regulated rivers. However, there were no differences in occupation rate, clutch size or number of successfully hatched juveniles between regulated and free-flowing rivers. As regulated rivers showed lower abundance of flying aquatic insects, which may also reduce the abundance of terrestrial invertebrate prey, regulation-induced changes in the export of emergent aquatic insects may explain both directly and indirectly the observed reduction in Pied Flycatcher breeding success along regulated rivers. Large-scale river regulation may therefore impair the breeding success of insectivorous birds through impacts on prey availability.

AB  - All over the world and for thousands of years, megaliths have been significant cultural elements, as well as sacred sites and places of power. Nowadays megaliths act as a strong magnet for tourists, who appreciate their history, esoterica and magic. Some megaliths were used for astronomical observations, so vital to maintain the continuity of harvest and crop. Other megalithic constructions were erected for funerary purposes, and served as individual or collective burial chambers. Megalithic structures are usually referred to as belonging to the European Neolithic but it has to be stressed that some megalithic constructions date back to the Bronze Age, and some were also built on other continents. Megaliths are a vital element of landscape and for historical reasons they are a sui generis monument, commemorating prehistorical cultures. At the same time, along with the remaining elements of the natural and cultural environment, they create a unique image of place identity, attracting large numbers of tourists. Interestingly, despite the strong attraction exercised by megaliths, there are still many places where tourism does not develop as rapidly as might be assumed. For the above-mentioned reasons, a comparative analysis of several megalithic sites has been conducted in Poland, Sweden, Portugal and Denmark. The following elements have been analysed: the megaliths immediate surroundings, the existing and planned or under-construction tourist and communication infrastructure, as well as architectural and spatial technical solutions and development. Also the key negative and positive elements have been defined which influence the tourist potential of the places in question, and constitute the tourism attractiveness factors of a region.

AB  - A national-level scenario analysis was conducted to comprehensively assess the long-term impacts of alternative forest management strategies on potential Finnish forest resource use. Four scenarios with varying management intensities were defined. The future development of forest resources under specific forest management schedules in accordance with the given scenarios was subsequently predicted over a 100-year period using the MOTTI stand simulator. The 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory data served as the initial simulation data, which included data from a network of 46,295 inventory sample plots that covered commercial forest areas across the country. The results suggest that there is significant potential to increase annual removals in a sustainable manner by applying more intensive forest management. In the intensive management scenarios, annual removals increased by approximately 40 % compared with actual removals. Moreover, annual areas of forest regeneration and pre-commercial thinning were 35 and 70 % larger than current treatment areas, respectively. Therefore, intensive management improves the profitability of forest management by nearly 50 %. However, there is significant variation in profitability between geographical regions because of differences in climate, forest site production potential and current forest structures. There were notable differences between scenarios in growing stock volumes and the amount of carbon stocks in forests. Extensive management increased growing stock from 2 to 3.5 billion m(3), while intensive management slightly decreased growing stock volumes and carbon stocks in forests. The results indicate that intensively managed forests are more efficient in capturing carbon from the atmosphere than extensively managed forests.

AB  - Calls for extending Nordic cooperation in the energy sector consider increased cooperation to be a tool to further support the creation of a smart Nordic energy system and realize the sustainable energy transition. To enhance our understanding of the state of Nordic energy cooperation, this article focuses on renewable electricity policy development in Finland and Sweden against the backdrop of facilitating and accelerating the Nordic energy transition. Building on previous research, the respective policy landscapes in Finland and Sweden will be scrutinized with insights from expert interviews, allowing the highlighting of the role of the actors in shaping the national and international energy transition policy. Ultimately, the article will explore the possibilities to enhance Nordic cooperation and question a possible future institutionalization of Nordic energy cooperation from the perspectives of Finland and Sweden. The aims of the article are twofold. First, to analyze the current policy mixes in Finland and Sweden with a special focus on bottlenecks and development needs and, second, to explore the viewpoints of the stakeholders from these two countries regarding potential and bottlenecks for developing Nordic energy cooperation.

AB  - The sustainable management of vulnerable natural areas requires accurate measurement of visitor flows, especially in mountain and protected areas. Pyroelectric sensors that detect the heat radiation emitted by human bodies are now commonly used in many regions, including Scandinavia and the UK, to count pedestrian traffic in both urban and natural areas. We used four different tests to investigate pyroelectric counters' accuracy in mountain winter conditions. Air temperature, distance to sensor, visitor clothing and visitor volume were all found to affect counter error rates. For tests within moderate winter temperatures ( between 0 degrees C and -18 degrees C) counters reported within manufacturer's claimed accuracy at 5% for 2 m range, but for -21 degrees C and below visitor numbers were over reported by 10.9%. Counter accuracy was generally unaffected by visitor clothing within 2 m of the sensor, but at a 4 m distance counters frequently failed to detect individuals in insulating down jackets more than fleece jackets. Counter error rates were slightly higher in outdoor than indoor tests, but still accurate within 5%. Error rates increased with increasing visitor traffic. The findings provide methodological implications for researchers and managers using automated visitor counters to estimate wintertime visitor use in mountain areas.

AB  - Smart and sustainable solid waste management in metropolises with systemic methods and other environmental issues are important factors in the development of urban management and circular economy. Extensive progress has been made towards reducing the environmental and human health impact of the generated solid waste in households. Under such a context, the major challenges are to reduce waste generation and optimize waste collection process in a way that lies within the circular economy. A Norwegian municipality has been investigated as a case study for this research. In this regard, a sustainable social enterprise model for solid waste management has been proposed. It has two key points; one is optimal waste collection and other is to observe effects of optimal route planning for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the data analysis has been done to observe the waste generation patterns in different areas of the investigated municipality and how can this be used for future placement and sizes of waste bins. The proposed solution is profitable for a circular economy as the optimal route planning will help to reduce fuel consumption, cost, and time used for waste collection. The social enterprise model (SEM) accomplishes the revenue and achieves the key performance indicators (KPIs) for sustainable development goals.

AB  - Due to the finite nature of mineral phosphorus reserves, effective management of anthropogenic phosphorus flows is currently under investigation by the international research community. This article emphasizes the importance of urban phosphorus flows, which are often marginalized due to the greater magnitude of agricultural phosphorus flows. A study on phosphorus flows in Gothenburg, Sweden, points out the potential role of solid waste in nutrient management, as the amounts of phosphorus in solid waste and in wastewater were found to be equal. Importation of food commodities accounts for 50% of the total inflow of phosphorus, and food waste is a major contributor of phosphorus to solid waste. The results suggest that solid waste incineration residues represent a large underestimated sink of phosphorus. Focusing on wastewater as the sole source of recovered phosphorus is not sufficient. The Swedish national goal on phosphorus recycling, which is limited to sewage sludge, targets only a part of the total phosphorus flow that can potentially be recovered. In contrast to previous studies, agricultural flows in Gothenburg were marginal compared to flows related to the urban waste management infrastructure. We emphasize the need for debate on preferable routes for disposal of waste with a high phosphorus content. Both recovery potential and usefulness of the recovered product for agricultural purposes have to be considered. Impacts of five waste management strategies on phosphorus flows were evaluated: incineration of all the waste, comprehensive food waste separation, installation of kitchen grinders, urine diversion, and separation of blackwater and food waste.

AB  - Retail trade is a private-sector activity: its structure and location result mainly from the action of individuals and firms in a given time and space. However, planning and regulations, which translate the way collective interest relates to private interest, have a significant effect on the activity.
   When examining the relationship between retail and urban space in the last three decades, in what may be regarded as a process of general deregulation, it is possible to identify the continued relevance of public policies, plans and projects, although with differing intensity. This finding applies considering either those rules specifically designed for retail or those with a spatial focus on places where retail plays a significant role, as is the particular case of the "city centre".
   Policy and planning are seen in this article in their relationship with retail and urban resilience, as the text deals with the way in which they influence the situation in the countries which were the object of study in the Replacis Euro-net research project: France, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey. The article intends to examine the role of the countries' cultural framework in policy design and to demonstrate how regulations, planning systems and practices contribute significantly to understanding the differences in urban retail structure between these countries (and, in particular, in some of their cities).

AB  - The effect of temperatures of -2.5 to + 20 degrees C on the biodegradation of concentrations 0.2-50 mu g cm(-3) of pentachlorophenol (PCP), phenanthrene, pyrene and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) was studied in soils sampled from an agricultural field and a relatively pristine forest in Helsinki, Finland. At the temperatures simulating seasonal variation of boreal soil temperatures [Heikinheimo, M., Fougstedt, B., 1992. Statistic of Soil Temperature in Finland. Meteorological Publications 22. Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland], the response of mineralization of PCP, phenanthrene and 2,4,5-TCP was the most effective in the rhizosphere fraction of the forest humus soil at the substrate concentrations of <= 5 mu g cm(-3). In the control incubation, performed at constant temperature of + 20 degrees C, the mineralization yields of the model pollutants were highest in the agricultural soil with the highest applied substrate concentration (50 mu g cm(-3)). The results suggest that the high level of pollutant mineralization at + 20 degrees C resulted from the apparent adaptation of the soil microbial community to the high substrate concentration. No such adaptation occurred when the soils were incubated at temperatures simulating the actual boreal soil temperatures. The present results stress the role of adjusting the incubation conditions to environmentally relevant values, when assessing biodegradation of anthropogenic organic compound in boreal soils.

AB  - We argue that in the present conditions of differentiated societies a preferable form of police governance and accountability should both be built upon and actively strive towards universal and trans-local criteria, rather than be built upon on some local features or idiosyncrasies. The local governance of the police appears too simple a remedy for police legitimacy and accountability since it might predispose the police to unprofessionalism and heterogeneity of standards, making it vulnerable to co-optation by powerful local interests. The article is based on our experiences of the Finnish form of police governance that has functioned quite well, partly because policing is embedded in the Nordic welfare state model, which strongly supports citizens' universal rights and social equality. However, the ideas put forward are urgently needed in differentiated societies, characterized by increasing socioeconomic inequality and multiple sources of cultural identity and belongingness. For us the concept of spatial representation appears to be a fundamental aspect in all governance. The argument rests on the idea that modern, differentiated society calls for representations of spatiality and belongingness that are inclusive rather than exclusive, universal rather than particular and trans-local rather than local. Our arguments for trans-local police governance are specified in terms of the universal rule of law, a uniform approach to policing, general professional police competencies and a general professional ethos in policing.

AB  - This article addresses the challenges for the EU Rural Development Program (RDP) to promote sustainable bioenergy production from agriculture. Drawing on the Swedish example, we identify opportunities for farmers and discuss agricultural-based bioenergy production in relation to the program objectives for agricultural competitiveness, sustainability and climate effects, and rural development. The sustainability and climate effects of agricultural-based bioenergy can be ascertained only through contextual analysis, and research indicates that rural development may be best promoted through local collaborative energy systems. Contrasting two ideal-type roles farmers may assume in bioenergy production, we discuss Swedish institutional contexts of energy production. In Sweden, the national energy policy tends to favor large-scale energy solutions and farmers taking on the roles as suppliers of primary products in large-scale energy systems. For RDP objectives to be realized, this tendency needs to be countered, local solutions need to be supported, and a national three-tiered energy policy integration needs to be furthered.

AB  - Maintenance of biodiversity in commercial forests has become a main goal in forestry, and several new management principles to reach that goal have been introduced lately. For example, in even-aged forestry, tree retention (leaving a proportion of trees standing in clear-cut sites) is widely used to increase the structural diversity and the amount of dead wood in forests. However, the cost-efficiency of the new management principles is poorly studied. To increase the amount of dead wood, an alternative way could be a change in the thinning regime, so that the self-thinning builds up of woody debris of a growing stand. We used long-term (200 years) simulations to compare ecological and economical effects of the two alternative management practices to increase the amount of dead wood in forest stands: (1) green tree retention and (2) growing stands unthinned. We simulated stand growth and management of 12 pine and 12 spruce stands that represented sites in different parts of Finland. We found that growing stands unthinned produced about 5-6 times more dead wood than retention with 20 trees left per hectare. In terms of economical loss, leaving stands unthinned reduced the net present value of harvest revenues less than 20%. Consequently, leaving stands unthinned offers a cost-effective option to increase the amount of dead wood in commercial forests. The effects of unthinned management were, however, dependent on thermal sum and initial stand density, indicating that biodiversity-oriented management practices should be designed for local conditions.

AB  - Due to climate change and rapid urbanisation, many Norwegian cities and urban areas suffer from pluvial flooding caused by intense rainfall exceeding the capacity of the stormwater management system. This results in increased runoff rates, volumes and peak flows in the drainage network. In response to these challenges, the authors explore the potential of utilising the urban surface's ability to transport floodwater as an integral component of the stormwater infrastructure. When the capacity of the stormwater drainage system is exceeded, the overland flow paths transporting floodwater are considered a part of the stormwater management system, as floodways. The study proposes a spatial GIS method to map existing drainage lines and identify existing surface areas that function as floodways, combined with an automated process to identify which drainage lines could be implemented as stormwater management measures. Critical points are introduced to assess the floodways' potential hazards, combined with a classification method to evaluate and sort floodways. A case study from Trondheim, Norway, was used to demonstrate how drainage lines can be identified as floodways using the proposed method. The case study is also used to illustrate how a GIS-based analysis can be extended from identifying to evaluating floodways and whether GIS is sufficient for floodway evaluation. The method enables urban planners and municipalities to identify which areas of the urban surface already function as floodways during extreme events, and to prioritise measures to secure such areas and increase the city's flood resilience. The results highlight the need to assess existing areas that function as floodways, and to implement and design needed areas as floodways. GIS-based methods combined with an evaluation scheme can be an adequate tool to map and evaluate floodways in urban areas. When using GIS-based methods, however, the corresponding hazard potential, and also the uncertainty of the floodway's spatial placement, should be considered.

AB  - This article is about regional development based on the principles of circular economy and the industrial symbiosis framework. Nowadays tremendous amount of solid waste from household, industrial and agricultural materials accumulate in the territories of different countries around whole world. Finland has experience in waste techno parks design and in the development of waste branch around the whole country. Finland has considered be one of the leading country in Circular Economy and its government strategic goal is to be the leading country in the world in Circular Economy until 2025. The Finnish experience shows that there has to be close co-operation between companies, universities and authorities, but also common goal and understanding.
   The main questions: which are the elements that could be adapted from the Finnish Circular Economy and the resource efficiency thinking, and how to implement ideas into other cultural and industrial environments in Russia. Our researchers together could discuss and decide which are the key elements that can be used and which of them contradict to using industrial symbiosis development in Russia.

AB  - The ecological state of the Baltic Sea and the inland waters has raised interest in reducing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources. In this study our main aim was to estimate the trends in agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes and to explain them by large scale changes in land use and climate. We used long-term monitoring data of discharge and nutrient concentrations of seven small catchments and 20 river basins. In the analysis we used two regression based models to calculate nutrient fluxes and to make source apportionment, and Mann-Kendall statistics to study trends in nutrient concentrations and climatic variables. Annual mean temperature increased at six meteorological stations out of the 16 stations included in the study. There was a statistically significant increase in temperature in late summer/early autumn at 14 stations. There were no trends in annual mean runoff in any of the river basins but there was a decrease in runoff in spring or early summer in 15 and an increase in mid-winter runoff in 13 river basins. There was an increasing trend in the nitrogen concentrations and a decreasing trend in the phosphorus concentrations. The flow normalized nitrogen flux to the Baltic Sea increased steadily until the mid 2000s and has decreased by 20% from that time until 2012. The flow normalized phosphorus flux has steadily decreased from early 1990s to 2012. The specific agricultural nitrogen loading value was 1340 kg km(-2) yr(-1) and the phosphorus loading value 83 kg km(-2) yr(-1). Clearing of new fields explained 50% of the increase in the nitrogen flux to the Baltic Sea between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2006. September mean temperature explained 15-30% of the variance in the nitrogen concentrations in the small catchments and 53% of that in the large river basins. Changes in field area or climate did not explain changes in the phosphorus fluxes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - I studied carabid-beetle assemblages in boreal spruce-forest stands representing early secondary succession, produced by three different logging methods, in central Finland in 1995-1998. The logging methods studied in eight separate study areas were: unlogged control stands, traditionally clear-cut stands, stands within which three 1600 m(2) openings were felled and stands of modified clear-cutting, within which three small tree groups (20-30 live standing mature trees) were retained. Pretreatment samples were collected in 1995 and the stands were logged the following winter. A three-summer follow-up study indicated the following. (1) Carabid assemblages changed with varying speed and intensity after logging. (2) Stands with small openings maintained the original assemblage structure best. Generalists were more abundant in clear-cut stands than in the stands with openings, indicating stronger assemblage-level changes in the large clear-cuts. (3) Carabid species showed varying responses to a moisture gradient, to the amount of trees removed and to the abundance of red wood ants. Some forest species with poor dispersal ability were associated with for closed and moist or mesic sites. These findings are discussed in the light of the ecological characteristics of the species and in relation to forest management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article discusses the EU's new defence package with emphasis on CARD (Coordinated Annual Review on Defence), PESCO (Permanent Structured Cooperation) and EDF (European Defence Fund). The aim is to strengthen the EU as a security actor and encourage strategic autonomy. This package challenges Norwegian security, defence, and defence-industrial policies. The research questions are: What consequences will these EU initiatives have for Norwegian defence-industry and defence-research policies? How will the authorities (Ministry of Defence; MoD) act to maintain a national defence industry? We apply instrumental and institutional theories. Instrumental theories expect rational actions in accordance with logic of consequences. Institutional theories expect appropriate actions in line with established culture and expectations in their surroundings. The EU's security and defence policy becomes more similar to other EU policy areas. Therefore, a multilevel governance approach is relevant. Our interviews with representatives of Norwegian authorities and Norway's defence industry reveal that they have fragmented knowledge and expectations about the significance of the defence package. We conclude that the authorities act instrumentally, but the lack of a comprehensive understanding makes it difficult to answer rationally. The authorities therefore also act according to a cultural perspective.

AB  - Measure plans are currently being developed for the Water Framework Directive (WFD) by European water authorities. In Sweden, such plans include measures for good ecological status in the coastal ecosystem. However, the effect of suggested measures is not yet known. We therefore experimented with different nutrient reduction measures on land and in the sea, using a model system of two coupled dynamic models for a semi-enclosed bay and its catchment. The science question was whether it is worthwhile to implement measures in the local catchment area to reach local environmental goals, or if the status of the Bay is more governed by the water exchange with the Sea. The results indicate that by combining several measures in the catchment, the nutrient load can be reduced by 15%-20%. To reach the same effect on nutrient concentrations in the Bay, the concentrations of the sea must be reduced by 80%. Hence, in this case, local measures have a stronger impact on coastal water quality. The experiment also show that the present targets for good ecological status set up by the Swedish water authorities may be unrealistic for this Bay. Finally, we discuss when and how to use hydro-ecological models for societal needs.

AB  - Understanding the degree to which human interaction may alter natural animal behavior has become increasingly important in developing effective conservation strategies. We examined two populations of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in Montana and Finland. Goshawks in Finland were not protected until the late 1980s, and prior to this protection were routinely shot, as it was believed that shooting goshawks would keep grouse populations high. In the United States, Goshawk were not shot as a management strategy. Though aggressive nest defense has been characterized throughout North America, goshawks in Finland do not show this same behavior. To quantify aggression, we presented nesting goshawks with an owl decoy, a human mannequin, and a live human and recorded their responses to each of the trial conditions. We used statistics to compare the two populations. Our results suggested that goshawks in Montana exhibit more aggressive nest defense behaviors than those in Finland. While this could be due to some biotic or abiotic factor that we were not able to control for in a study on such a small scale, it is also possible that the results from this study suggest another underlying cause, such as an artificial selection pressure created by shooting goshawks. As human impacts on wildlife have become a topic of increasing interest, studies have focused on issues such as overexploitation and habitat loss. However, little research has examined potential anthropogenic impacts on animal behavior. Understanding the degree to which human interaction may alter natural animal behavior has become increasingly important in developing effective conservation strategies. We examined two populations of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in Montana and Finland. Goshawks in Finland were not protected until the late 1980s, and prior to this protection were routinely shot, as it was believed that shooting goshawks would keep grouse populations high. In the United States, Goshawk were not managed as predator control. Though aggressive nest defense has been characterized throughout North America, goshawks in Finland do not show this same behavior. To quantify aggression, we presented nesting goshawks with an owl decoy, a human mannequin, and a live human and recorded their responses to each of the trial conditions. We evaluated the recordings for time of response, duration of response, whether or not an active stimulus was present to elicit the response (i.e., movement or sound), and the sex of the bird making the response. We used t-Test with unequal variance to compare mean number of responses and response duration. Our results suggested that goshawks in Montana exhibit more aggressive nest defense behaviors than those in Finland. While this could be due to some biotic or abiotic factor that we were not able to control for in a study on such a small scale, it is also possible that the results from this study suggest another underlying cause, such as an artificial selection pressure created by shooting goshawks.

AB  - With climate change altering ecosystems worldwide, forest management in Europe is increasingly relying on more adaptable non-native tree species, such as Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). However, the ecological consequences of the increased utilization of Douglas fir on arthropod diversity and ecosystem functioning are not fully known. Here we assessed how non-native Douglas fir as well as large- and small-scale differences in the environmental context, affect epigeal spider abundance, biomass, taxonomic and functional diversity, and community structure in Central European forests. Our study sites were divided into two regions with large differences in environmental conditions, with seven replicates of five stand types, including monocultures of native European beech (Fagus sylvatica), non-native Douglas fir and native Norway spruce (Picea abies), as well as two-species mixtures of European beech and each of the conifers. Contrary to our expectations, Douglas fir promoted small-scale spider diversity, and abundance and biomass (activity density). On the other hand, it decreased spider functional divergence and altered spider community structure. Microhabitat characteristics had opposing effects on spider diversity and activity density, with more open stands harboring a more diverse but less abundant spider community. Overall, our findings suggest that increasing Douglas fir utilization at the expense of Norway spruce does not necessarily decrease the diversity of epigeal arthropods and may even promote local spider diversity and activity density. However, care needs to be taken in terms of biodiversity conservation because typical forest spider species and their functional divergence were more strongly associated with native beech than with coniferous stands.

AB  - A warmer climate leads to rising sea levels. Despite uncertainties about how rapid and substantial future sea-level rise (SLR) will be, society needs to prepare and adapt. This study examines the state of planning for future SLR in Sweden by surveying 33 coastal municipalities in southern Sweden and interviewing local, regional and national authorities with relevant accountability. The results reveal that there are considerable gaps in current planning for SLR. Almost one-third of municipalities lack guiding planning documents for SLR, and more than two-thirds do not discuss SLR beyond 2100. We argue that the prevailing uncertainty and ambiguity in assessments of future SLR is problematic within a traditional "predict-then-act" paradigm, and that robust approaches, such as scenario planning, can reduce many of these problems.

AB  - Postage stamps are a very political, territorially grounded and yet overlooked part of visual culture. We argue that the mundane omnipresence of stamps gives them considerable nation-building power and makes them exemplary tools of what Michael Billig calls 'banal nationalism.' By focusing on the socially constructed visual qualities of stamps, we argue that their 'reading' as political, socioculturally and territorially specific texts offers valuable insights into the evolution and outlook of the issuing state and the 'imagined community' within its boundaries. Our examination of 1457 stamps issued in continental Finland between 1917 and 2000 shows how the desired visual representation of the Finnish state, nation and society has evolved over time, along with the changing outlook of the national elite, its relationship with ordinary citizens and the country's geopolitical context. The stamps illustrate how the state's focus shifted from war to peace, Finland's economy diversified and specialized, and the Finns reached a relatively high level of social welfare and equality. The myth of Finland's cultural homogeneity remained strikingly strong despite dramatic changes in Finland's cultural make-up, suggesting that not only presence but also absence of a narrative from a visual scene can be strongly meaningful. Over the course of the twentieth century, Finnish nationalism grew increasingly 'banal' and inclusive in character, but the stamps maintained their central role in citizenship education. Our findings promote the use of postage stamps in the teaching and research of political geography and identity-political iconographics.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the impact of six tree species on vegetation and soil. Eighty stands growing side by side, and of different dominant species, were selected in 26 locations. Within each location the stands had the same soil condition, landscape position and previous land-use history. Ground vegetation and soil were sampled in each stand. The tree species were: Norway spruce (Picea abies Karsten.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), silver fir (Abies alba Miller), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and oaks (Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). The geographic and geological characteristics of sites influenced the vegetation and the soil chemistry more than the tree species did. Forest management influenced the ground flora more than the tree species did. Number of species and equitability differed little with tree species. The ground flora under Norway spruce included more mosses than under the other trees species except silver fir. The ground flora under Norway spruce was more typical of oligotrophic and acidic conditions than the flora under European beech. Soils under coniferous species, especially Norway spruce, were more acidic and had higher concentrations of aluminium than soils under hardwoods. The effect of tree species on soils was greatest in the topsoil (0-10 cm).

AB  - Prevention and restoration are two options for minimizing environmental and economic damages caused by invasive species. Prevention lowers the probability of an invasive species arriving. However, once invasive species have invaded an ecosystem, it is rarely economically or physically viable to eradicate them. Policy after invasion then focuses on restoration or returning habitats to their un-invaded states. We determine the optimal prevention of invasion of the emerald ash borer in Colorado, given the timing of invasion is uncertain and that managers may be able to restore the invaded ecosystem upon an invasive species arrival. Results are used to generate a switching frontier where it is optimal to invest (or not) in prevention given combinations of the probability of invasion, effectiveness of prevention efforts, and restoration possibilities.

AB  - Habitat changes represent one of the five most pervasive threats to biodiversity. However, anthropogenic activities also have the capacity to create novel niche spaces to which species respond differently. In 1880, one such habitat alterations occurred in Landvikvannet, a freshwater lake on the Norwegian coast of Skagerrak, which became brackish after being artificially connected to the sea. This lake is now home to the European sprat, a pelagic marine fish that managed to develop a self-recruiting population in barely few decades. Landvikvannet sprat proved to be genetically isolated from the three main populations described for this species; that is, Norwegian fjords, Baltic Sea, and the combination of North Sea, Kattegat, and Skagerrak. This distinctness was depicted by an accuracy self-assignment of 89% and a highly significant F-ST between the lake sprat and each of the remaining samples (average of approximate to 0.105). The correlation between genetic and environmental variation indicated that salinity could be an important environmental driver of selection (3.3% of the 91 SNPs showed strong associations). Likewise, Isolation by Environment was detected for salinity, although not for temperature, in samples not adhering to an Isolation by Distance pattern. Neighbor-joining tree analysis suggested that the source of the lake sprat is in the Norwegian fjords, rather than in the Baltic Sea despite a similar salinity profile. Strongly drifted allele frequencies and lower genetic diversity in Landvikvannet compared with the Norwegian fjords concur with a founder effect potentially associated with local adaptation to low salinity. Genetic differentiation (F-ST) between marine and brackish sprat is larger in the comparison Norway-Landvikvannet than in Norway-Baltic, which suggests that the observed divergence was achieved in Landvikvannet in some 65 generations, that is, 132 years, rather than gradually over thousands of years (the age of the Baltic Sea), thus highlighting the pace at which human-driven evolution can happen.

AB  - Analysis of the role emotions play in a range of social processes has increased significantly, but is neglected in the context of cultural policy-making. Recent literatures in feminist and emotional geographies draw attention to how emotions are emergent in, and play a role in shaping, a broad range of social contexts and processes, while other literatures stress the need to 'personalise' the expert and consider the emotional aspects of planning. Inspired by these literatures we deploy the notion of 'affective urbanism' to study how emotions are interwoven with cultural policy spaces in the city and explore the 'emotional regimes' that incorporate emotions with the multi-scalar politics that is shaping urban cultural policy-making. This is undertaken through an analysis of emotions in the working lives and political contexts of cultural policy-makers in Stockholm (Sweden), Gdansk (Poland) and Manchester (UK). Overall the paper seeks to develop a research agenda that places emotions centrally in studies of cultural policy formation and implementation.

AB  - Rauma is a medieval town located on the west coast of southern Finland. In 1991, UNESCO listed the core area of the town, Old Rauma, as a World Heritage Site due to the well preserved northern European wood architecture and urbanism. Current Old Rauma is a residential and commercial area of 29 ha, divided into 237 plots. The author investigated the spontaneous and cultivated flora of Old Rauma in 2017. The aim of the floristic survey was to assess the authenticity of courtyards in a historical urban setting. Altogether 243 yards were surveyed for their cultivated and cultural relict plants two times during summer 2017. Heirloom varieties of fruit trees, berries and shrub roses were common, likewise such perennials as Aquilegia vulgaris, Convallaria majalis, and Hepatica nobilis, traditionally grown in old Finnish gardens. The most characteristic cultural relict species was Corydalis nobilis, which originates from the 18(th) century. The floristic survey indicated that large-growing trees with abundant seed production, such as Betula pendula and Acer platanoides, might endanger the historic townscape, similarly as the numerous columnar cultivars of Thuja occidentalis, planted in residential yards during the past 30 years. Increasing knowledge of the biocultural heritage hidden in domestic yards would benefit the management of the World Cultural Site.

AB  - Drawing on primary data from a consumer survey (N=2000), this study demonstrates a clear growth potential in rural tourism in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, which is, however, hampered by innovation gaps. At the conceptual level, the study offers a model that identifies the following five innovation gaps in Scandinavian rural tourism: (1) the portfolio gap, (2) the policy departmentalization gap, (3) the knowledge gap, (4) the change motivation gap, and (5) the resource interpretation gap. At the empirical level, the study shows that rural tourism has its basis in a dichotomy between authenticity and modernization. New and prospective customer groups, particularly from Germany, demand more diversified and higher quality rural tourism products than current groups, for example, in relation to outdoor opportunities, leisure festivals, and cultural activities. With rural assets, it is possible to expand the portfolio without compromising the rural image. Rural tourism enterprises and destinations remain slow movers in terms of innovation endeavours, and the study indicates that the discrepancies between potential customers' service expectations and their spending patterns can partially explain this phenomenon. The merit of the innovation gap model is that this model identifies potential rebalancing actions at both enterprise and destination levels.

AB  - Brexit presents significant challenges and uncertainties for the future governance of policy areas currently managed by the EU. This is especially the case with fisheries policy. The UK government has stated an ambition for post-Brexit fisheries policy to be based on sustainability and the use of scientific evidence. Yet how these aims will be achieved and formalised into post-Brexit governance structures remains to be seen. This article investigates fisheries governance arrangements in three non-EU countries: Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. These cases offer lessons for the UK on governance and institutional arrangements for fisheries post-Brexit. However, none of these cases account for devolution and division of fisheries policy competences across multiple territories. This places significant limits on the potential for direct policy transfer from these countries to the UK.

AB  - Ensuring future food and energy security will require large changes in consumption and production pat-terns, including enhanced animal and human excreta recycling. Although these shifts are considered in many scenario studies, their implications on the logistical requirements for effective recycling are rarely analysed. Here we translated two existing stakeholder co-designed food system scenarios for Sweden to 5 x 5 km resolution maps of animals, crops, and humans. We used optimization modelling to identify biogas plant locations to minimize transport costs and maximize nutrient reuse. We then compared sce-narios, including full recycling under current landscape configuration, through Life Cycle Assessment. The reduction in meat consumption and imported food in both co-designed scenarios, by definition, led to less nutrients available in manure for recycling back on cropland, and less material available for diges-tion. Less excreta meant lower national benefits, for example 50% less greenhouse gas emissions savings in the most divergent scenario. However on a per transport basis the benefits of recycling were more important: recycling remained a net financial benefit even if transport costs were to increase. Although fewer biogas plant locations were necessary (184 and 228 for alternative futures, vs 236 under current conditions) to process human and animal excreta, the regional clustering of locations did not change substantially across scenarios. Regions such as Skane and Vastra Gotaland consistently required the most biogas plant locations across scenarios. Focusing early construction investments in these regions would be resilient to a large array of food system futures. Our spatially-explicit open access scenario maps can be used to explore logistics for such planning, and explore the impact of landscape configuration on other sustainability priority areas.

AB  - The loss of natural forest habitats due to forestry is the main reason for the decline in boreal forest biodiversity of the Nordic countries of Europe. Ecological rehabilitation may provide means to recover and sustain biodiversity. We analyzed the effects of controlled burning and dead-wood creation (DWC) on the diversity of pioneer wood-inhabiting fungi in managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southern Finland. Altogether 18 stands were first subjected to a partial cutting with ordinary logging residues in form of cut stumps and treetops left on site. The subsequent rehabilitation treatments consisted of a controlled burning applied in half of the stands and three levels of dead-wood creation (5, 30 and 60 m(3) ha(-1)). The DWC involved creation of logs; felling of whole trees to mimic downed logs formed by natural disturbance processes. Each treatment was replicated three times. Inside each stand, substrates were sampled in two different biotopes; one on mineral soil and one on mineral soil with a thin peat layer. We surveyed the fungal flora on the logs (n = 364) and the ordinary residue stumps (n = 1767) and tops (n = 845) five years after the treatments.
   When comparing different stands, controlled burning had a significant effect on species composition; certain species were significantly more frequent on substrates in burned stands than in unburned stands, indicating that these species were favored by controlled burning. By contrast, we found no significant effects of DWC levels or biotope on species composition or richness. When comparing different substrates, 99% of the logs hosted at least one species and the occurrence probability of certain species was significantly higher on logs than on ordinary residue stumps and tops. Yet, volume-based rarefaction analyses showed that residues were more species dense than the logs, indicating that ordinary logging residues constitute important resources for many pioneer species.
   We conclude that controlled burning combined with DWC have strong effects on biodiversity; it modifies the composition of the pioneer wood-inhabiting fungal species found in managed forests and may thereby also influence the further succession and diversity of the secondary fungal flora.

AB  - In the 1970s, Norway had not officially acknowledged their Indigenous population, the Sami. In the following decade, two activist films, Let the River Live (Greve 1980) and The Taking of Samiland (Eriksen and Tannvik 1984), focused on the Alta conflict - protests against the construction of a power plant in Sami territory - Indigenous rights and colonial processes. Inspired by discussions concerning documentary, activism and decolonialism, this article investigates how the films frame Sami interests and challenge perceptions of the Norwegian state. Because both films are collaborations across ethnic boundaries, they also challenge the supposed insider/outsider perspective of Sami and Indigenous film, offering decolonial narratives by centring on Indigenous voices and experiences, confronting the idea of Norway as homogenous and representing the state as a colonial oppressor. They represent a political turning point that has changed politics, film production and collective memory.

AB  - This article examines the effectiveness, legitimacy, and fairness of heritage conservation outcomes under the 1972 World Heritage Convention (1972 WHC), with a focus on recognising and respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in heritage nomination, protection, and management. Examining conflicts surrounding World Heritage sites in Kenya and Sweden, this article argues that recognition of biocultural heritage and biocultural rights can promote environmental justice and help meet global environmental challenges. To promote the conservation of both built and natural landscapes, the article recommends expanding protection for the relationship between humans and their environment. Recognising biocultural heritage under UNESCO conventions could promote Indigenous sovereignty, protect cultural and natural heritage, and contribute to global efforts to address climate change. The article calls for further research mapping biocultural heritage in natural and mixed heritage sites and advocates for fuller engagement with Indigenous Peoples to increase the ability of the 1972 WHC to promote sustainability as it enters its second half-century.

AB  - Shelterwood is commonly assumed to be a more nature-friendly silvicultural system than clear-cutting. However, dead-wood pools - a key characteristic of natural forest - have been seldom compared between these systems. We investigated how shelterwood harvesting influences the dynamics of different dead-wood fractions in Estonia, where the predominant forestry model is clear-cutting based but 'seminatural' (using native tree species and, to a significant extent, natural regeneration). We measured dead-wood pools in 49 Scots pine dominated stands (representing all shelterwood harvesting stages), and in 11 pine-dominated and 10 Norway spruce-dominated stands as before-after experiments (1st stage only). We analysed dead-wood amounts in relation to site conditions and the proportion of timber harvested, and we compared the shelterwood impacts with published estimates from Estonian clear-cuts. Fine woody debris (5-9.9 cm) increased with the harvest. The volume of coarse woody debris was 19-27 m(3) ha(-1) in uniform shelterwood stands in pine forest (0-25 years after the first harvest); 63 m(3) ha(-1) in strip shelterwood stands in spruce forest (immediately post harvest). In before-after experiments, post-harvest dead-wood amounts depended on fraction and harvesting intensity, which determines the balance between the input of new debris (logs; stumps) and the loss of pre-existing standing and downed dead trees. After the first shelterwood harvesting, dead-wood pools remained relatively stable, which contrasts with the large fluctuations after clear-cutting. In the long term, however, shelterwood did not sustain generally larger dead-wood pools than the clear-cutting system in seminatural forestry setting. The issue to be resolved in both types of regeneration cuttings is the near-complete loss of standing dead trees, which probably requires new harvesting techniques.

AB  - Aim To investigate the long-term changes in aquatic vegetation in a lowland, shallow lake, and to assess the relationship between aquatic vegetation and natural and anthropogenic catchment changes.
   Location Gundsomagle So, Zealand, Denmark: a shallow (mean depth 1.2 m), hypereutrophic lake (mean annual total phosphorus (TP) c. 700 mu g TP L-1) located in a predominantly agricultural catchment (88% cultivated land). The lake is presently devoid of macrophytes.
   Methods One hundred and forty-seven contiguous samples from a sediment core (taken in 2000) were analysed for macrofossil remains together with loss-on-ignition and dry weight. From an earlier sediment core (taken in 1992), 67 samples were analysed for pollen and the two cores were correlated using the ignition residue profiles. Core chronology was determined by Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating of the recent lake sediments, while older sediments were dated by pollen-stratigraphical correlation, as C-14 dating proved problematical. Aquatic macrofossil abundance was used to reconstruct past changes in the lake's plant community and water-level. The contemporary catchment land-use change was inferred from sedimentary pollen data, and soil erosion to the lake was deduced from the minerogenic content of the lake sediments.
   Results The macrofossil record covers the last 7000 years, but aquatic plant remains were scarce prior to c. 1300 bc. After this date the abundance of submerged and emergent macrophyte remains increased dramatically, paralleled by an increase in sediment minerogenic matter and non-arboreal pollen (NAP). Aquatic plant remains were abundant for more than 3000 years until the mid 1900s. Macrofossils of Linum usitatissimum (L.) (flax) and high pollen percentages of 'Cannabis type' (hemp) were recorded in periods between c. 1150 bc and 1800 ad.
   Main conclusions Our study suggests that, between c. 5000 bc and 1300 bc, the submerged plant community was confined to the littoral zone. From 1300 bc onwards, the submerged macrophyte vegetation expanded rapidly across the lake bed, presumably as a response to lake shallowing caused by a combination of climatic-induced water-level lowering and enhanced erosional infilling of the lake basin due to intensified anthropogenic activities in the catchment. The lake was meso-eutrophic and had an extensive and diverse aquatic flora for more than 3000 years, until the middle of the twentieth century. In periods between c. 1150 bc and 1800 ad, the lake experienced direct anthropogenic impact from retting of fibre plants (Linum and Cannabis). Over the last 200 years, erosional infilling of the lake basin increased drastically, probably as a result of agricultural intensification. In the twentieth century, the lake was strongly affected by nutrient enrichment from both point sources (sewage from built-up areas) and diffuse agricultural run-off which led to hypertrophic conditions and the collapse of the submerged vegetation c. 1950-60. The concept of 'naturalness' and the implications for lake conservation are discussed.

AB  - The habitat requirements and effects of forest management on insects belonging to higher trophic levels are relatively unknown in forest ecosystems. We tested the effect of forest successional stage and dead wood characteristics on the saproxylic parasitoid (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea) assemblage in boreal spruce-dominated forests in northern Sweden. Within each of nine areas, we selected three sites with different management histories: (1) a clear-cut (2) a mature managed forest and (3) an old-growth forest. Parasitoids were collected in 2003 using eclector traps mounted on fresh logs, which were either untreated (control), burned, inoculated with fungi, or naturally shaded, and on artificially-created snags.
   Both forest type and dead wood characteristics had a significant effect on parasitoid assemblages. Grouped idiobionts and some species, such as Bracon obscurator and Ontsira antica, preferred clear-cuts, while others, such as Cosmophorus regius (Hym., Braconidae) and other koinobionts, were associated with older successional forest stages. No single dead wood substrate was sufficient to support the entire community of parasitoids in any forest type, even when the regular host was present. In particular, snags hosted a different assemblage of species from other types of dead wood, with parasitoids of Tetropium spp. such as Rhimphoctona spp. (Hym., Ichneumonidae) and Helconidea dentator (Hym., Braconidae) being abundant. These results indicate that a diversity of dead wood habitats is necessary to support complete assemblages of beetle-associated parasitoids from early successional stages of dead wood and that parasitoids may be more sensitive to habitat change than their hosts.

AB  - The effects of climate, site quality, stand structure and landscape on the development of biodiversity within plantations were investigated, with particular emphasis on woodland vascular plants, bryophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, and subcanopy Coleoptera. Data were obtained as part of a broad study of biodiversity within Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Corsican pine (Pinus nigra var. maritima), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations of different ages and in different climate zones (uplands, foothills, lowlands) across Britain. There was a significant effect of climate zone on the species-richness of all four taxonomic groups, with upland stands having the highest bryophyte counts and lowland stands having the highest Coleoptera counts. Species counts of woodland vascular plants and mycorrhizals were negatively correlated with distance to nearest ancient semi-natural woodland. Counts of bryophytes were positively correlated with the amount of semi-natural woodland within 1 km of the stand, and Coleoptera counts were positively correlated with the amount of non-wooded semi-natural vegetation within 1 km. Other factors such as tree species, soil and stand structure were significantly related to counts of woodland vascular plants and bryophytes. Stand age and land-use history did not feature in the best-fit regression models. The development of biodiversity in plantations is clearly influenced by the proximity and amount of semi-natural vegetation within the landscape, suggesting that to be cost-effective, management for restoration and enhancement of biodiversity in planted stands should be targeted towards those stands in 'semi-natural landscapes' where agricultural land-use has historically been of low intensity.

AB  - For traffic safety reasons, Sweden has lowered speed limits on major roads that lack directional separation of traffic. For some of these roads, regional authorities, municipalities, and other local stakeholders have sent appeals to the government opposing the implemented speed limit reductions. The appeals have mainly referred to negative effects on regional development and have suggested that the speed limit reductions be abandoned. This paper identifies the characteristics of roads where appeals against speed limit reductions have been filed and where local stakeholders claim that speed limit reductions are a threat to accessibility and regional development. The results of logistic regression modelling show that appeals are more likely for speed limit reductions on long road sections, on European roads, and in areas with a state university, and less likely in areas with high population density and areas defined as vulnerable by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth. We investigated these policy conflicts using frame theory. In this paper, we identify two policy frames: speed limits for traffic safety and speed limits for regional development. These two policy frames are related to different views on how to best strive towards regional accessibility and safety goals in remote areas. The different views are likely not easily aligned by more information or facts since they concern deeper questions, such as what constitutes basic accessibility of good quality and how large risks are acceptable on the road network. This study thus uncovers not only a policy disagreement but a policy controversy in the Swedish context.

AB  - Humans are known for their capacity to disperse organisms long distances. Long-distance dispersal can be important for species threatened by habitat destruction, but research into human-mediated dispersal is often focused upon few and/or invasive species. Here we use citizen science to identify the capacity for humans to disperse seeds on their clothes and footwear from a known species pool in a valuable habitat, allowing for an assessment of the fraction and types of species dispersed by humans in an alternative context. We collected material from volunteers cutting 48 species-rich meadows throughout Sweden. We counted 24 354 seeds of 197 species, representing 34% of the available species pool, including several rare and protected species. However, 71 species (36%) are considered invasive elsewhere in the world. Trait analysis showed that seeds with hooks or other appendages were more likely to be dispersed by humans, as well as those with a persistent seed bank. More activity in a meadow resulted in more dispersal, both in terms of species and representation of the source communities. Average potential dispersal distances were measured at 13 km. We consider humans capable seed dispersers, transporting a significant proportion of the plant communities in which they are active, just like more traditional vectors such as livestock. When rural populations were larger, people might have been regular and effective seed dispersers, and the net rural-urban migration resulting in a reduction in humans in the landscape may have exacerbated the dispersal failure evident in declining plant populations today. With the fragmentation of habitat and changes in land use resulting from agricultural change, and the increased mobility of humans worldwide, the dispersal role of humans may have shifted from providers of regular local and landscape dispersal to providers of much rarer long-distance and regional dispersal, and international invasion.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - This article considers established metrics for smart city development and evaluates their suitability for implementation in Arctic urban settlements. To do this, the article first surveys smart city literature and the standardization of 'smartness' metrics, with particular interest in the International Standards Organization's (ISO) categorization efforts. It then proposes a northern framework of measurement to evaluate smart cities that adjusts smart metrics from current non-Arctic scholarship to the relatively low populations, peripheral development, remote locations, and harsh climate conditions of the circumpolar north. To test this argument of a new smart framework, the article moves to examine the strategies of three circumpolar cities at different points of smart development: Anchorage (United States), BodO (Norway) and Oulu (Finland). The article concludes by identifying areas of success and shortcomings for each city analyzed. Smart cities can be a crucial step towards a sustainable future in the circumpolar north, contributing to a 'smarter' approach to economic, social, and environmental development. Exploring this is important because these frameworks have implications for how policymakers in northern regions choose to plan and implement their city strategies.

AB  - This study investigates cultural differences in tourist preferences for climate change adaptation strategies of cross-country skiers in Austria and Finland. We used the value orientation approach to empirically test whether this concept is sensitive to skiers' climate change adaptation preferences in the two respective countries. The comparisons between the two countries were made even more specific with three identical motivation-based segments that accounted for heterogeneity within the respective samples. All comparisons were based on either regular survey questions or on the results of a choice experiment. The results reveal significant differences between skiers for the overall national samples, as well as for numerous comparisons between specific segments. Thus, we conclude that adaptation strategy planning should consider cultural differences and that the transferability of strategies even within the western cultures of Europe is limited.

AB  - In this paper I argue that environmental policy research could benefit from developing an understanding of how the concepts of 'scale', 'scalar strategies', and 'struggles over scale' play out empirically in processes of environmental policymaking and planning. I emphasise how scale, as an issue in environmental governance, is not merely an independent variable causing specific outcomes; rather, it is negotiable, allowing actors to adopt different strategies in order to pursue their varying agendas. I show how a local struggle can be represented as a global struggle: a case study concerning the domestic use of natural gas in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, and how this metamorphosed into a struggle about what was the appropriate geographical scale at which the environmental and climatic consequences of a natural gas project should be assessed, is described. By framing climate change as a global issue, local actors were able to portray the natural gas project as environmentally friendly. I argue that the realisation of this natural gas project should be seen in light of how strategies over scale-which were developed in the debate-fitted with climate discourses institutionalised in national policy and politics.

AB  - Mine tailing management is one of the largest environmental issues related to mining operation. This study uses chemometrics to assess the dispersion of iron mine tailing-affected sediments in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway. Metal concentrations (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and physico-chemical sediment characteristics (conductivity, organic matter, sulphate, chloride, grain size, CaCO3, pH) were analysed in seven sediment cores collected in a transect out of the fjord along with two reference cores. Results of hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis allowed to distinguish between mine tailing-affected and non-affected sediments. Non-affected sediments were especially characterised by high levels of organic matter whilst mine tailing-affected sediments varied significantly in sediment characteristics depending on location in the fjord. Crucial parameters to reveal mine tailing-affected sediments varied between the target metal Fe along with metals of Cd and Mn, albeit less significant. Variations in mine tailing-affected sediment characteristics could be attributed to other anthropogenic activities in the fjord. Despite potential disturbances, chemometrics made it possible to identify dispersion of mine tailing-affected sediments to cover the inner and middle parts of the fjord. The study demonstrates the advantage of applying chemometrics on complex fjord systems, which in this case was used to distinguish mine tailing-affected sediments from areas with elevated levels of metals not necessarily related to the mine.

AB  - The EcoBalance Model was developed at VTT, the Technical Research Center of Finland, in the early 1990s, and it has been used in several case studies in Finland. The model estimates the total consumption of energy and other natural resources, the production of emissions and wastes, and the costs caused directly and indirectly by residential areas and urban structures on a life-cycle basis. The results of the case studies give information about the ecological impacts of different solutions in urban development. The case study introduced in this article indicates that eco-villages are not necessarily very sound from an ecological point of view. On average, eco-villages require more energy and raw materials, they produce more emissions, and they cost more than urban small-house areas. The EcoBalance model can be used when planning new areas or developing new urban structures, constructing buildings and infrastructure, as well as developing sustainable life styles.

AB  - Nuclear power is facing an uncertain future in Sweden due to political directives that are seeking to phase out this energy source over coming decades. Here we examine the environmental and economic costs of hypothetical future renewable-energy-focused cases compared with the current nuclear and hydroelectricity-centred mix in Sweden. We show that if wind and photovoltaics replace entire nuclear power while maintaining the current level of dispatchable backup capacity including hydroelectric power and peak gas power, 154 GW of wind power will be required and will generate 427.1 TWh (compared with the actual demand of 143.7 TWh) to reliably meet demand each hour of the year. As a consequence, the annual spending on electricity systems will be five times higher than the status quo. Increasing dispatchable power, increasing transmission capacities to other countries, and generating electricity from combined heat and power plants even when there is no heat demand, will together reduce the required capacities of wind and solar photovoltaic by half, but it will double the greenhouse gas emissions during the combustion process. In conclusion, our economic and greenhouse-gas emissions analyses demonstrate that replacing nuclear power with renewables will be neither economic nor environmentally friendly with regards to the climate.

AB  - Species of national conservation concern require management action to reduce the threat of extinction. As part of its obligations to reduce national loss of biodiversity, the Norwegian authority for nature management (The Norwegian Environment Agency) published an action plan in 2010 for one of these species, the Slavonian grebe Podiceps auritus. The American mink Neovison vison, a non-native, invasive species with wide spread negative effects on native fauna, was highlighted as a major potential treat. We used an adaptive management approach that included management trials with the aim to assess whether mink predation is likely to be affecting grebe numbers significantly. We monitored mink activity, and put in place mink control measures at three of our seven study lakes. We then used 35 pairs of artificial nests, with one of each pair equipped with cameras, to measure predation at all seven lakes. The combined use of progressive experiments in an adaptive management/monitoring framework showed that mink activity was generally low with a mean activity at raft stations of between 0.41-1.22 per lake (n = 5), a range of zero to three excavations executed as a result of hunting (n = 3), and no incidences of mink nest predation (n = 35). Hence we conclude that mink is presently not likely to be a significant negative factor on grebe breeding success in the targeted lakes. We found a high nest predation rate by hooded crow with 18 of 21 identified predation events being identified to this species. Future effort should investigate non mink related threats to the Slavonian grebe such as the role of hooded crow in nest predation. This case study exemplifies the usefulness of the adaptive management/monitoring framework as a powerful means of testing hypotheses and to inform management, especially when knowledge of the focal system is poor.

AB  - A common approach when predicting landscape preference is to use preference judgements to group landscape scenes and thereafter predict preference in the context of each of these categories. This study used an alternative method where no initial categorization was made and hence the result is based on ratings on all slides for all the variables. A broad sample of 119 subjects drawn from the public rated 60 colour slides for preference and seven other questions expressing the predictor variables. The slides were sampled to represent the half-open traditional Swedish cultural landscape as defined by an existing nature classification. The relationship between the questions was studied with cluster and factor analysis. Results show a connection between preference, exploring potential in the landscape and feelings of safety. This is consistent with results from studies using the traditional approach to predicting preference. In addition, a question involving management was clustered with 'safety: 'preference' and 'explore: This demonstrates that the degree of management is linked to the affective part of the experience of a landscape. Notable is that the result reflects a split in two types of questions: more emotionally and more cognitively based questions. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Mining is one of the key industries in the world and mine water pollution is a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems. Historical monitoring data on the pollution history and impacts in aquatic ecosystems, however, are rarely available, so paleolimnological methods are required to explore the consequences of past pollution. We studied the history of cladoceran community dynamics in Lake Kirkkojarvi, southern Finland, including the periods before, during and after mining. We analyzed the geochemical composition and cladoceran subfossil remains in a Pb-210-dated sediment core to evaluate the magnitude, rate, and direction of cladoceran community changes through time. The cladoceran community was altered significantly by mining activity that occurred during the mid-twentieth century. During more recent times, however, eutrophication effects have overridden the impacts of mining. After mining ceased, the cladoceran community underwent an abrupt regime shift towards taxa that reflect more eutrophic conditions. This change was caused by intensive farming activity and fertilizer use over the past few decades. The recent history of Lake Kirkkojarvi is a textbook example of a regime shift triggered by multiple human-caused stressors. Our findings also highlight the utility of cladocerans as bio-indicators in pollution research and illustrate the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic modification.

AB  - The neoliberal trend in spatial planning seemingly causes the loss of control of spatial plans for destination developments in the mountain regions of southern Norway. The predominant local discourse, as seen in local newspapers and other media, was originally positive to the development of second homes. Changes in development plans have, as in the Skeikampen-destination case, incited strong counter-discourses based on concerns for pasture rights, nature values, and access, in addition to sustainability in general. These discourses create a perception of reality in stark contrast to the central-government discourse, as found in the plan and building act, and governmental documents.

AB  - The active creation of coarse woody debris (CWD) has been suggested as a measure to preserve and restore biodiversity in managed forests. A common practice in Sweden is to create high stumps at final cutting. We evaluated the importance of high stumps for saproxylic (wood-dependent) beetles in a boreal forest landscape in central Sweden. The number of high stumps created on clearcuts was recorded and the beetle fauna under the bark of high stumps of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was sampled. High stumps yielded only 0.13% of CWD volume and bark area in the landscape. Out of the 29 beetle species most frequently found in the landscape, high stumps were the major source of recruitment at the landscape level for only one, Hadreule elongatula (Gyllenhal). For the remaining 28 beetle species, less than 1% of the landscape's population occurred in high stumps on clearcuts. The abundance of H. elongatula increased with the area of the surrounding forest land that was covered by clearcuts within a radius of 1000 m. This is the first example of a saproxylic species associated with clearcuts, in contemporary forest landscapes, for which such an occurrence pattern has been documented.

AB  - Adaptive reuse of cultural heritage has for the last decades resulted in an interplay between heritage and real estate values. Transformation of former industrial sites has turned out as leading examples of this development. Commodification of heritage has come into being by property developers realising heritage resources as real estate value with the result that two different value systems appear to overlap. The creative reuse of brownfields has also challenged management strategies for preservation and reuse contributing to the interplay. This article examines and discusses this interplay based on interviews with four developers involved in transformation of former industrial sites in Norway. Additional information and market analysis from an appraisal company supplies the interviews concerning which qualities are demanded by customers in the commercial sector. The data are analysed as potential indicators of how developers work and thereby given conceptual labels identified as categories and decisive factors for the interplay between cultural and economic value to occur. Five categories involving both hard and soft aspects, have through this procedure been identified of significance for how heritage is realised as a development resource; locational, timing, dependence on urban plans, dependence on the current market, and the long-term perspective and the economic capacity of the developer.

AB  - To test whether landscape structure affects the temporal variability of bird populations and species turnover, we estimated breeding bird abundances in a boreal forest area in northern Finland during the years 1990-1995. The analyses were conducted at three spatial scales: Feint-count station (4 ha), block (12.5 km(2)), and landscape unit levels. At the census point scale. temporal variability (CV) of generalist species correlated negatively with amount of unforested habitat. At the block scale, temporal variability of forest edge and managed forest species correlated negatively with the amount of forested area in the landscape. No response was observed among sedentary, migratory, and virgin forest species at these lower scales. At the landscape unit scale. forest-edge and managed-forest species such as chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs L.), and redpoll (Carduelis flammea L.) showed higher temporal variability, whereas sedentary and virgin forest species such as cuckoo (Cuculus canorus L.), raven (Corvus corax L.), and hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix L.) showed lower temporal variability in the moderately fragmented landscape than in the less-fragmented landscape. Of the virgin-forest species, crossbills (Loxia spp.) and titmice (Parus spp.) showed more variability in the less-fragmented landscape, whereas the rest of the virgin-forest species (hawks, grouses, woodpeckers, etc.) reflected more temporal variability in the moderately fragmented landscape unit. The results were only partially in accordance with expected trends, and there were differences between scales in variability patterns of species and species groups. Large-scale landscape characteristics mainly affected the temporal variability of sedentary and virgin-forest species, whereas species not restricted to special habitat structures were more affected by smaller-scale habitat structure.

AB  - To maintain biodiversity in managed forests we must understand the patterns and processes that regulate the occurrence and dynamics of species in undisturbed ecosystems. We compared biomass and species composition of canopy lichens on 180 lower branches of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three pairs of old-growth and managed (selectively logged) stands in northern Sweden (30 branches per stand). The purpose was to evaluate the effect of substrate quality (branch characteristics) on patterns of lichen biomass for two different growth forms (foliose and fruticose).
   Old-growth stands had six times higher lichen mass per spruce branch, and two times higher expressed as percentage of branch mass, compared to mature stands of managed forest. Lichen mass was strongly related to mass, diameter, and age of branches. Fruticose, pendulous species (Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp.) were highly sensitive to forest practices. In contrast, type of forest had no significant effect on foliose species. Species number per stand was the same (15 species) in both types of forest, but there were marked differences in the relative abundance of different lichen groups. Results suggest that limited amount of substrate (i.e., small branches) available to lichens, and young branches, providing only a short time for lichen colonization and growth, are important factors limiting epiphytic lichen abundance in managed forests. Conversion of old-growth forest into young, managed stands will lead to a significant reduction in epiphytic lichen mass. This in turn may probably affect nutrient cycling in forests and has negative consequences for animals that utilize canopy lichens as food, shelter, or nesting material.

AB  - Assessment of habitat thresholds is a topical issue in ecology, both from theoretical and applied perspectives. We examined how forest structure influences selection of breeding habitat in the Eurasian treecreeper (Certhia familiaris). It is an old-growth forest passerine, which can be considered an umbrella species. Habitat selection data, covering five breeding seasons, were collected from a study area across three spatial scales: (a) territory core scale (a radius of 30 m), (b) territory scale (a radius of 200 m) and (c) large scale (a radius of 500 m). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the radii of 30 and 200 m from the nest were the most important spatial scales for the forest patch occupancy. A loss of forest habitat and a low circumference of stems within the territory decreased the probability of occupancy. There was a distinct threshold in the amount of forest cover on forest patch occupancy when the volume of timber was taken into account. At low timber volumes (0-151 m(3)/ha) the amount of forest cover was negatively related to the occupancy rate of forest patches. This negative relationship changed abruptly when the volume of timber exceeded 152 m(3)/ha, after which forest cover had a positive effect on the occupancy rate of forest patches. This is a new way to examine habitat thresholds in relation to forest cover. Furthermore, as debated in recent literature, treecreepers also tend to respond to habitat loss rather than to changes in habitat configuration, which stresses the need for habitat restoration and conservation. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of within-territory structure over the characteristics of the habitat matrix in selection of breeding habitat. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prior research is scarce concerning transports by Nordic companies along the New Silk Road rail routes between Northern Europe and China. Due to geography, Finland has a favourable location for speedy rail transports to Asia compared to maritime transports. This paper focuses on two rail routes - Kouvola-Xi'an and Helsinki-Hefei - and investigates their origins, development, and use for exports and imports between Finland and China, as well as their extensions both in the Nordics and in Asia. Drawing on source materials from news archives and press releases, it is found that the traffic has increased strongly on one of the connections, whereas the other has faded. We analyze the reasons for this outcome and compare between the cases, and present possible explanations for the differences in operating the routes. We also find that the Finland-China rail routes are mainly used by Finnish exporters and importers, and less so by other Nordic companies, as Scandinavian countries are more easily accessed by sea transport. The different modes of transport differ from each other not only as to cost and time, but also regarding safety, reliability, and ecological impact, and it can be expected that in the future, sustainability will play a more significant role in the companies' transport choices. Yet, railway traffic in EuropeAsia trade still constitutes a very small share of the entire volumes, even though the annual growth is impressive.

AB  - With the rapid acceleration of wind energy development there is a growing need to meet the consequences this has for the natural environment. Failing to mitigate environmental impacts is an important cause of conflict in wind energy projects, leading to costly delays in planned wind energy development. It is therefore of the utmost importance to identify effective solutions and measures to reduce such impacts. This requires that the joint responsibility for mitigation across stakeholders is recognized and acted upon. This is exemplified with the blackblade concept that has shown to reduce bird collision rates at the Smola windpower plant in Norway by 70%. While presented as a "golden bullet" solution in the media, there remain unanswered challenges that need to be addressed. However, instead of disagreeing on the uncertain efficacy elsewhere, I pose that collaborative and transdisciplinary action is needed to jointly resolve remaining challenges and actively seek for solutions to support the sound implementation of promising wind-turbine collision-reducing solutions.

AB  - Background: Roadsides have been acknowledged as potential substitutes for semi-natural grasslands and other open habitats with high biodiversity, many of which are now declining. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation of biodiversity are largely based on studies of plants in meadows or pastures, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted guidelines for roadside management, based on actual roadside studies. We recently performed a systematic mapping of the evidence on how roadside management affects biodiversity and the dispersal of species. Through this process, we found 98 studies on how the richness or abundance of species on roadsides is affected by management such as regular mowing, burning, grazing or selective mechanical removal of plants. Since all of these interventions entail removal of plant biomass, they are comparable. Most of the studies recorded management effects on vascular plants, but there were 14 investigations of insects and other invertebrates. We now intend to proceed with a full systematic review of how maintenance or restoration of roadsides based on non-chemical vegetation removal affects the diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates.
   Methods: Most of the evidence on which the proposed systematic review is to be based will be selected from the systematic map. To identify more recently published literature on the topic of the review, we will perform a search update using a subset of the search terms applied for the systematic map. The criteria for inclusion of studies will be the same as for the map, except that interventions and outcomes will be restricted to those relevant to the review. Relevant studies will be subject to critical appraisal and categorised as having high or low validity for the review. Studies with low validity will be excluded from the review. Utilisable data on outcomes, interventions and other potential effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles. A narrative synthesis will describe the validity and findings of all studies in the review. Where a sufficient number of studies report similar outcome types, meta-analysis will be conducted.

AB  - Offshore wave energy conversion is expected to develop, thus contributing to an increase in submerged constructions on the seabed An essential concern related to the deployment of wave energy converters (WECs) is their possible impact on the surrounding soft-bottom habitats In this study, the macrofaunal assemblages in the seabed around the wave energy converters in the Lysekil research site on the Swedish west coast and a neighbouring reference site were examined yearly during a period of 5 years (20042008). Macrobenthic communities living in the WECs' surrounding seabed were mainly composed by organisms typical for the area and depth off the Swedish west coast At both sites the number of individuals, number of species and biodiversity were low, and were mostly small, juvenile organisms The species assemblages during the first years of sampling were significantly different between the Lysekil research site and the nearby reference site with higher species abundance in the research site. The high contribution to dissimilarities was mostly due to polychaetes Sparse macrofaunal densities can be explained by strong hydrodynamic forces and/or earlier trawling. WECs may alter the surrounding seabed with an accumulation of organic matter inside the research area This indicates that the deployment of WECs in the Lysekil research site tends to have rather minor direct ecological impacts on the surrounding benthic community relative to the natural high variances (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Twenty years has passed since Finland joined the European Union in 1995. Agriculture was one of the key areas in which significant changes were both anticipated and realised. Besides the European-wide structural change towards larger production units and the steeply decreasing number of farms, the EU's agricultural policy has brought about significant changes in farming as a livelihood and the ways in which it is practiced in Finland. These changes involve environmental considerations related to fertilisation or tillage practices, for example, but they are also reflected in wider meaning-making related to what farming fundamentally is about. Using the concept of good farming as the key, we explore how the introduced agri-environmental policies have changed farming practices and how this is reflected in the ways that good farming ideals are understood and constituted among different farmers. The analysis is based on interviews in which farmers describe their farming practices, purposes and the influence of policies. Our results suggest that the ideals related to good farming are diversifying and changing as the ways of gaining a livelihood through farming changes. This change occurs as the ideals are renegotiated when performing new voluntary or forced practices. Good farming ideals do not only function as a cultural barrier to the adoption of new practices, but they can actively contribute to the accommodation and development of the practices.

AB  - This article analyses changes in the Finnish innovation policy from the early 2000s to 2016. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a framework to understand and characterise changes in and different approaches to innovation policy implementation. The framework highlights the evolutive nature of innovation policies and sheds light on often very conflicting trade-offs and tensions within and between various approaches to innovation policy. Second, drawing upon the Finnish case, we elaborate the complexity of contemporary innovation policy implementation and show how the focus has changed since the early 2000s. Based on these findings, we discuss emerging ideas framing the "new innovation policy" and implications to policy-making.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in many parts of the world for more effective biomass utilization due to legislative and public interest in sustainable development. Whilst much of the effort has been on energy generation from biomass, there is considerable interest on biomass availability and utilization for other end uses. With about 1% of the world's commercial forest areas, Sweden provides about 10% of the sawnwood, and pulp and paper that is traded on the global market. The Swedish agricultural sector also contributes to biomass availability, not only by production of sustainable food crops, but also by utilizing side streams and underutilized land for biomaterial purposes. To meet the challenges that climate change presents, there has to be a shift to sustainable biomass production and increased interest in promoting a circular bioeconomy. This review presents a systematic assessment on the availability of biomass and its utilization potential in Sweden. The review also focuses on biomass production and trade in the Swedish forest industry. In addition, the environmental impact of biomass utilization is discussed.

AB  - The oeuvre of beloved Polish painter Ferdynand Ruszczyc (1870-1936) reflected the patriotic Neo-Romantic landscape trend of the fin-de-siecle prevalent in Germany and the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden). It should be considered in the context of Nordic visual culture for two reasons: (1) until the affiliation of Central and Eastern European nations with the Soviet Union in the wake of World War Two, nations bordering the Baltic formed a single, fluid territory of cultural exchange, and (2) Ruszczyc's oeuvre displays significant commonalities with dominant patriotic and Neo-Romantic trends of progressive artists around the Baltic Sea, where landscape became a vehicle for expressing dreams and emotions, as well as love of homeland. This article situates Ruszczyc's national and artistic identity at the crossroads of cultures and artistic impulses, regional as well as international. Ruszczyc was born in Bohdanow near Vilnius (now Belarus) to a Polish father and a Danish mother. Like many Polish artists from the Russian partition, he was educated at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, where he studied with Ivan Shishkin (1832-1898) and Arkhip Kuindzhi (1878-1910). He also travelled to Sweden. Ruszczyc was influenced by the Russian art circle Mir Iskusstva (World of Art, est. 1898) and is often compared with Nordic (e.g., Akseli Gallen-Kallela; Finnish, 1865-1931) and German (e.g., Otto Modersohn; 1865-1943) artists. His visions of nature are sometimes raw monumental images of the northern landscape or fairy-tale fantasies containing symbolic allusiveness and a mythical, poetic element that evoke intimate memories of the land of his childhood. In his paintings, Ruszczyc presented the changeability of seasons, orchards, soil and streams, clouds formations, and tree trunks with palpable emotion. By exposing the material substance of nature, his paintings also reveal its mystical aspect, its ability to transform in accordance with the cyclical, cosmic rhythm of growth, maturation, death, and rebirth.

TI  - Trust and Norwegian-Russian energy relations
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Trust in Norwegian-Russian energy relations is one in the making. Both sides have actively pursued policies to build trust, particularly over the past decade. The process has been driven by shared economic interests, the prominence of the petroleum industry in both countries, and a desire to improve political relations on both sides. Factors shaping trust are pre-existing on the one hand, and determined by the actors' signals on the other. Different organisational and cultural preferences likewise play a role in the development of trust and degree of co-operation. While trust appears to have contributed to breakthroughs in co-operation such as the resolution of the maritime border and new joint ventures in oil exploration, a lack of trust owing to diverging interests and market forces is inhibiting collaboration in the realm of gas. This potentially puts Norway and Russia on a path to increased competition for their primary gas markets, first in Germany and then in the rest of continental Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A successful implementation of a mammalian conservation policy requires knowledge of how people value animals. Little is known about how people value large carnivores. The discussion is therefore dominated by people's perception of wolves. In a mail survey (65% response rate) we asked persons residing in areas with populations of wolves, bears, lynx, and wolverines whether they were willing to pay to reach the national conservation goals for those species. We compared 69 Swedish counties with a representative national sample of Swedes living outside the areas with large carnivores. We found that the behavioral intention willingness to pay (WTP) was negatively related to the presence of wolves, to the urban profile, and to opposition against the European Union Monetary Union. We encourage future studies to compare national surveys with local samples in controversial issues to discover conflicting views among national, regional, and local natural resource management stakeholders.

AB  - The issue of residential segregation has been on the Swedish political agenda since the early 1970s. This paper analyses the background for this interest, presents some basic features of socio-economic and ethnic residential segregation, and discusses some fundamental contextual properties regarding the Swedish welfare state, its institutional set-up and changes in housing and other policies that have affected the conditions for segregation processes. Three more specific anti-segregation policies are also identified and analysed: housing and social mix policy (first initiated in the 1970s); the refugee dispersal policy (initiated in the 1980s); and the area-based urban policy (initiated in the 1990s). Of these three, the last two have a clear ethnic focus while mix policies primarily aim for socio-economic and demographic mix. The analysis shows that none of the policies have managed to affect levels of segregation more than marginally, the reasons being ineffective implementation (the mix policy), failures in the design (the refugee dispersal policy) or conflicting aims inherent in the policy (area-based interventions).

AB  - Climate change is expected to increase annual and especially winter runoff, shorten the snow cover period and therefore increase both nutrient leaching from agricultural areas and natural background leaching in the Baltic Sea catchment. We estimated the effects of climate change and possible future scenarios of agricultural changes on the phosphorus and nitrogen loading to the Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments. In the agricultural scenarios we assumed that the prices of agricultural products are among the primary drivers in the adaptation to climate change, as they affect the level of fertilization and the production intensity and volume and, hence, the modeled changes in gross nutrient loading from agricultural land. Optimal adaptation may increase production while supporting appropriate use of fertilization, resulting in low nutrient balance in the fields. However, a less optimal adaptation may result in higher nutrient balance and increased leaching. The changes in nutrient loading to the Baltic Sea were predicted by taking into account the agricultural scenarios in a nutrient loading model for Finnish catchments (VEMALA), which simulates runoff, nutrient processes, leaching and transport on land, in rivers and in lakes. We thus integrated the effects of climate change in the agricultural sector, nutrient loading in fields, natural background loading, hydrology and nutrient transport and retention processes.

AB  - In the first year's data of the 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory (2005-2008) 533 active and 178 abandoned ant mounds were found yielding 4.2 mounds ha(-1). We found 11 species: Formica rufa, F. polyctena, F. aquilonia, F. lugubris, F pratensis, F. exsecta, F. fennica, F. pressilabris, F. forsslundi, F. suecica and F. uralensis. Five species occurred throughout the country, and four were restricted to the south. We found species-specific associations with either mineral soils or mires, with forest site type and with tree-canopy openness. Low fertility decreased the occurrence of polygynous species with large worker force, and sun-exposition was favourable for species with smaller colonies presumably because only large worker force enables metabolic thermoregulation of nests. Forest fragmentation and increased amount of edge habitats favourable for colony founding have presumably increased nest density whereas drainage of mires has reduced the amount of habitat of three species since the 1950s.

AB  - This paper presents a tailor-made scenario approach for climate change adaptation planning, which emphasises involvement of stakeholders in the development of socioeconomic scenarios and relates to the planning situation and interest of the planning entity. The method was developed and tested in case studies in three different sectors in Sweden (the health sector, the tourism sector and water resource management). The result of the case studies is that the tailor-made scenario approach facilitated the engagement of the local planning body in climate change adaptation and helped them to analyse consequences and possible solutions in a structured way. However, the scenarios that emerged mainly focused on socioeconomic drivers on which the planning body had a large impact or drivers that can be influenced through cooperation with other actors at the local or regional level. While this result underlines the need for local stakeholder involvement in scenario processes, it also indicates a local bias that could be remedied by a stronger representation of national and global perspectives in the scenario development process. Finally, we discuss how a "bottom-up" approach could be combined with a "consistency" approach, which points towards a possible way forward to a hybrid methodology that is compatible with the scenario framework currently being developed in connection to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC.

AB  - Hymenoscyphus fraxineus causes a destructive invasive tree disease known as ash dieback threatening the survival of common ash not only in the forests, but also in urban and landscape settings. Pruning is a potential management practice that could help maintain tree vitality and aesthetics in parks, gardens, alleys and recreation areas, as well as maintaining veteran trees having high heritage or cultural value, or trees with high genetic importance (e.g. located in clonal seed orchards). In this study we investigated the maximum distance proximal to the lesion margin at which H. fraxineus can be detected on individual branches infected by the fungus in order to provide recommendations for pruning. Pruning of branches was carried out on 38 trees in southern Sweden. Tissue samples including bark and wood were collected from the margin of the lesion and at 5 cm intervals proximal to the lesion. Molecular analysis revealed presence of H. fraxineus in 91.3% of the investigated lesions. The proportion of lesions at which H. fraxineus could be detected declined with increasing distance from the lesion margin, with a significant reduction in the number of positive samples at 10 cm proximal to the margin. At 30 cm from the lesion edge the pathogen was never detected. Our results suggest that routine pruning may help maintain the vitality of younger trees. Pruning branches at least 35 cm from visible, active lesions in the bark should exclude the fungus and therefore reduce the probability of stem infection by H. fraxineus, however this cultural control tactic may only be economically feasible for high value amenity trees.

AB  - This paper describes song structure and repertoire variation in ortolan buntings (Emberiza hortulana) from an isolated and declining Norwegian population, analysed by using the minimal unit of production approach. Males from the studied population sang strophes similar to both dialects found in geographically closest populations in Sweden. We did not observe any simplification of song structure, which is typical for isolated populations of birds. On the contrary, the studied population was characterised by a greater song variation. Song type repertoires were larger both at the individual level and if we considered numbers of different syllables and song types found within the population. This variation seems to reflect the influence of habitat fragmentation and female deficiency at the boundary of the species range on song learning processes and males' dispersion. We also found a remarkable within-song-type variation, which seems to be independent of song type variation level of song production, but its function is unexplained.

AB  - The ongoing trend in the public sector is to make more sustainable procurements by taking into account the impacts throughout the entire life cycle of the procurement. Despite the trend, the only deciding factor can still be the total costs. This article answers the question of how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be taken into account in municipal solid waste (MSW) management when selecting an incineration plant for source separated mixed MSW. The aim is to guide the decision making of MSW management towards more environmentally friendly procurements.
   The study was carried out by calculating the global warming potentials (GWPs) and costs of mixed MSW management by using the waste composition from a case area in Finland. Scenarios of landfilling and combustion in three actual waste incineration plants were used to recognise the main processes that affect the results. GWP results show that the combustion of mixed MSW is a better alternative than landfilling the waste. The GHG results from combustion are greatly affected by emissions from the combustion and substituted energy production. The significance of collection and transportation is higher from the costs' perspective than from the point of view of GHG emissions. The main costs, in addition to collection and transportation costs, result from the energy utilization or landfilling of mixed MSW.
   When tenders are invited for the incineration location of mixed MSW, the main focus should be: What are the annual electricity and heat recovery efficiencies and which are the substituted fuels in the area? In addition, in the case of a fluidized bed combustor it is crucial to know the combusted share of mixed MSW after preparing solid recovered fuel (SRF) and the treatment of rejects. The environmental criteria for the waste incineration plant procurements should be made in order to obtain clear instructions for the procurement units. The results can also be utilized more widely. The substituted fuels in the area and the effect of the plant location on the utilization of the produced energy can already be identified when planning an appropriate site for the waste incineration plant.

AB  - Fragmented landscapes may have implications for the genetic structure of populations and for the microevolution of plant species. In particular, landscape fragmentation and/or population isolation might affect the evolution of plant mating systems. Here, we study the consequences of landscape fragmentation on the genetic structure of populations of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria with a mixed mating system. Our study area, the south-western Finnish archipelago, was formed after the glacial ice sheet started to retreat 12 000 years ago. Due to the isostatic land uplift following the glacial retreat, suitable habitats have been formed gradually, and as a consequence, populations of V. hirundinaria differ in age, size and their degree of isolation in the area. We hypothesized that a mixed-mating system has been selected for in these populations due to the advantage of self-fertilization in newly colonized areas and the advantage of outcrossing in adaptation to heterogeneous environments. To test this hypothesis, we collected seeds of open-pollinated flowers from 13 V. hirundinaria populations differing in size, age and isolation, and used 15 microsatellite markers to perform progeny-array analysis to estimate population-level outcrossing rates, population genetic indices and population structure. We found that V. hirundinaria is almost completely outcrossing in the study area with no signs of past self-fertilization and/or mating among relatives. The overall low inbreeding coefficients indicate that even in small populations mating among relatives is rare. High allelic richness of both maternal and offspring genotypes as well as limited genetic differentiation among the studied populations indicate strong gene flow among them. Our findings suggest that V. hirundinaria has successful seed and pollen dispersal among populations that has allowed colonization of new habitats in this fragmented landscape and led to a genetically well-mixed group of populations at the scale of the study.

AB  - During the past decades, goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations have declined in torest-dominated landscapes in Norway. To reveal the importance of different prey species in forest versus farmland landscapes, we video recorded 146 prey deliveries at four nests in a farmland-dominated area and three nests in a forest-dominated area in south-eastern Norway in June 2005. Thrushes and corvids were the dominating prey in both areas. We found higher diet diversity in the forest-dominated landscape, but we also found high dietary overlap, presumably due to the dominance of thrushes in both areas. Prey composition of forest versus farmland species differed significantly between the areas, mainly due to a higher proportion of corvids and a lower proportion of grouse in the farmland-dominated area. Goshawk diet thus reflects the habitats within the nesting territory.

AB  - Hydropeaking, defined as frequent and rapid variation in flow in regulated rivers with hydropower plants over a short period of time, usually sub-daily to weekly, alters hydraulic parameters such as water levels or flow velocity and exerts strong impacts on fluvial ecosystems. We evaluated the effects of hydropeaking on riverbank vegetation, specifically assessing the germination and establishment of seedlings and cuttings of plant species representing a variation in traits. We used seeds and seedlings and cuttings varying in size as phytometers, and transplanted them to riverbanks both above and below dams used for hydropower production in northern Sweden, selected to represent a gradient in hydropeaking intensity, and along a free-flowing reach. We also analyzed sub-daily water-level variables modified by hydropeaking to identify variables key in explaining the observed vegetation patterns. We found that plant responses to hydropeaking varied with species, with flood-intolerant species being the most strongly affected, as early as the germination stage. In contrast, seeds of flood-tolerant species managed to germinate and survive the early establishment phase, although strong erosive processes triggered by hydropeaking eventually caused most of them to fail. The fate of flood-intolerant species identifies germination as the most critical life-history stage. The depth and frequency of the inundation were the leading variables explaining plant responses, while the duration of shallow inundation explained little of the variation. The rise and fall rates of water levels were key in explaining variation in germination success. Based on the results, we propose restoration measures to enhance establishment of riparian plant communities while minimizing the impact on hydropower electricity production. Given the strong decrease in the germination of species intolerant to prolonged flooding with hydropeaking, planting of seedlings, preferably of large sizes, together with restrictions in the operation of the power plant during the establishment phase to enhance survival would be the best restoration option. Given the high probability of plant uprooting with hydropeaking, bank protection measures have the potential to increase riparian plant survival of all species, including flooding-tolerant species.

AB  - Transforming cities into low-carbon, resilient, and sustainable places will require action encompassing most segments of society. However, local governments struggle to overview and assess all ongoing climate activities in a city, constraining well-informed decision-making and transformative capacity. This paper proposes and tests an assessment framework developed to visualize the implementation of urban climate transition (UCT). Integrating key transition activities and process progression, the framework was applied to three Swedish cities. Climate coordinators and municipal councillors evaluated the visual UCT representations. Results indicate that their understanding of UCT actions and implementation bottlenecks became clearer, making transition more governable. To facilitate UCT, involving external actors and shifting priorities between areas were found to be key. The visual UCT representations improved system awareness and memory, building local transformative capacity. The study recommends systematic assessment and visualization of process progression as a promising method to facilitate UCT governance, but potentially also broader sustainability transitions.

AB  - Studies on globalisation often focus on large multinational companies and their strategic options for expansion. However, statistics show, that also small and mediumsized companies are increasingly able to internationalise and do so. In a construction setting this is often related to participation or even initiation of building projects. In particular, Swedish building companies have a potential competitive advantage in the booming market for sustainable building, energy efficiency and energy renovation. This paper studies two cases of Chinese sustainable building projects in the Beijing region where a small Swedish consultancy company participate. The main aim is to study how culture influence in two selected energy efficiency building projects involving Swedish and Chinese partners?The framework of understanding draws primarily on culture theory, yet also more indirectly on small business, organization and management theories. The method is based on interview and project documents. Interviews is done with representatives from Swedish and Chinese companies collaborating in two Chinese projects. One project is creating new office premises for a Chinese client, the other is a green hotel project. Both projects are designed, build according to EU green building norms and also eventually obtain this certificate. The projects are interrelated and can be seen as first a potential niche, second a ( larger) market for the Swedish company in China. Cultural similarities and differences transcend national distinctions and extend into company cultures related to the companies' different roles in the project. The pattern found is thus more of a multiple configuration of cultures than a dual culture clash. Nation, company and sector cultures interact and certain culturally based interpretations serve to confirm existing understanding of sustainable building projects. It is discussed how small companies are constrained by their cultural ballast, cultural capital. They continually base decisions on situational judgment within frames posited by their cultures, limited resources and network dependencies.

AB  - Europe is covered by distinct climatic zones which include semiarid, the Mediterranean, humid subtropical, marine, humid continental, subarctic, and highland climates. Land use and land cover change have been well documented in the past 200 years across Europe 'where land cover grassland and cropland together make up 39%2. In recent years, the agricultural sector has been affected by abnormal weather events. Climate change will continue to change weather patterns, for some regions, this will have a positive impact. For other regions, it will be negative. Hail, heavy rainfall, floods, and droughts may lead to a reduction in agricultural land in some regions with an additional impact on biodiversity. For that reason, major climatic and hydrological variables such as temperature, precipitation, vegetation index, and soil moisture must be regularly monitored and the trends of their deviations from the normal must be observed. This research investigates the quantity of potato production in the future in two stages. In the first stage, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)3 models are used for yield and soil moisture forecasting. The models are trained on a dataset acquired in time series from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)4 satellite from 2010 to 2019 and are compared by statistics on potato production from EUROSTAT5 at the national scale. In the second stage, the approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM)6 architecture of Sentinel 2 Vegetation Index satellite imagery together with weather and Sentinel 1 surface soil moisture information for the EU-28 member countries by season 2018 for single potato fields. Agricultural statistical data such as crop calendar, map, production area, yield, and acreage are collected from Eurostat while vector data collection from Land Use and Land Cover Survey (LUCAS) and Land Cover from national to small scale agriculture (CORINE)8. The ARIMA output performances measure Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE for soil moisture forecasting is 0.3792, 0.2816, 0.2679, 0.2110, and 0.1791 for East, West, South, North, and Centre EU respectively. MSE for potato yield forecasting is 0.0954, 0.081, 0.0589, 0.0447, and 0.0199 for North, Centre, East, South, and West EU respectively. The number of known crop field areas and the distance between them are different for each country and this alters the dimension of the classification input. Two countries of EU-28 do not contain information on potato location while the input dimensions of another two are too big to perform. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis of SVM has been implemented for a total of 24 states. The classification accuracies for kernel Radial Basis function are 98.53% in Austria, 99.39% in Centre of UK, 99.64% in Italia, 99.12% in Bulgaria and Greece, 99.43% in Sweden for Centre, West, South, East, and North EU, respectively, with the Sentinel Vegetation Index. The classification accuracies change with the amount of ground -truth data. The results show that some geographical and socio-economic biases like the chemical composition of the soil or the degree of automation in the agricultural sector are influencing in the statistical analysis.

AB  - Research into stakeholder perceptions of conventional aquaculture has focused upon issues such as risk, impact on other users of marine space, and the factors influencing consumers. However, some of these issues may become redundant with new aquaculture practices such as Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture (IMTA). For practices such as IMTA to realise their potential they must be socially acceptable and this may depend on satisfying key stakeholders. This study used in-depth interviews to identify potential concerns of stakeholders as well as perceived benefits in relation to the development of IMTA to a commercial level of production. A total of 44 interviews were conducted across 12 stakeholder groups in six countries: Cyprus, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway and Scotland. Levels of awareness and understanding of IMTA were mixed across stakeholder groups and across countries. Concerns were raised including: spatial location issues, food safety and disease. Perceived benefits of IMTA included: waste utilisation, minimisation of impacts to the benthos and the filtering of sea lice larvae. Also recognised as important was the creation of new income streams. The results showed that some issues/benefits were more important in certain countries. Risks to the environment, risks arising from governance and risks to the industry itself were raised, but stakeholders felt that these sources of risk could be addressed by research studies, education and changes to legislation. Stakeholders also believed that IMTA could contribute to improving the image of the aquaculture industry. For IMTA to successfully move forward from pilot scale to commercial scale development, it is imperative that the issues raised in this study form priorities for reform and action.

AB  - In the current context of climate change, discussions about tourism sustainability are gaining increased momentum. Over the past decade, some operators worldwide have started to certify their products and services as ecotourism or sustainable tourism. A certification or approval is considered to be a sign of general high product quality as well as an indication of environmentally and socially sound products. In this research note, we examine three different ecotourism certification and approval systems - from Sweden, Costa Rica and Australia. The note is based on a literature review of three different approval systems, conducted parallel to the planning of the Norwegian approval system for ecotourism launched in 2008. We outline the criteria and standards required in the different programmes as well as the basic principles of how the three systems are organised, financed and implemented. The programmes' strengths and weaknesses are briefly discussed, keeping a Scandinavian context in mind.

AB  - As a part of nation-wide monitoring of the impact of agriculture on the aquatic system, phosphorus (P) transport was measured from subsurface drained fields in Sweden. The measured transports was a mixture of P from surface, subsurface and,groundwater contribution. Fourteen of these fields together with a similar experimental field have been studied for at least IO years and most of them for much longer Transport of total phosphorus (TP) from four of the fields together accounted for 74% of the total transport. Five other fields together accounted for another 19%, while transport from the other five fields was more or less negligible. Based on factor combinations, a simple regression model for calculating TP concentration was used for prediction of the losses. The parameters included were livestock density (LD), HCl extractable P (P-HCl) in the topsoil, duration of high water flow (DHF) and soil specific areas (SSAs). The model was found to satisfactorily predict the TP transport in the streams of 32 small agriculture-dominated catchments in different parts of the country, with a P loss from arable land that was calculated as varying from 0.03 to 0.50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). However, for a very few catchments, the model worked only for transport by drainage water and not for P transport measured in the stream water.
   Eleven of the observation fields had been investigated since 1977 or earlier. During this period, a surplus of P added to the soil during the initial years was transformed to a slight negative balance of P. Transport from most of the fields was found to be relatively constant, but the two fields with the highest P transport showed an increased trend during the 1970s and 1980s.

AB  - Rock samples and the C-, B- and O-horizons of soils developed on these rocks were collected in forested areas along a 120-km south-north transect in southern Norway, passing through the city of Oslo. Forty samples (1 site/3 km) were analysed for 37 chemical elements (Ag, Al, As, An, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sr, Te, Th, Ti, TI, U, V, W and Zn) following an aqua regia digestion; pH (water extract) and loss on ignition were also determined. The O-horizon soils were additionally analysed for Pt. Gold is the only element that shows a clear anthropogenic peak in the O-horizon soils collected from the city of Oslo. Silver, An, Bi, Cd, Hg, Pb, S, Sb, Se and Sr all show a strong enrichment in the O-horizon when compared to the underlying C-horizon or the bedrock along the full length of the transect. Neither geology nor anthropogenic input of elements dominate the observed patterns. The most important factors for the observed element concentrations in the O-horizon are weathering, uptake (or rejection) of elements by plants and the kinetics of decay of the organic material in the O-horizon. Climate, especially temperature and precipitation, has an important influence on the formation and decay rates of the organic soil layer. Acid precipitation will delay the decomposition of the organic layer and lead to a natural enrichment of several metals in the O-horizon. Land use change, deforestation and liming can all increase the decay kinetics of organic matter and thus result in a release of the stored element pool. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates the challenges and critical factors for the development and management of a form of wildlife tourism that is based on an active and practice-near role of natural sciences knowledge, and that, ultimately, can contribute to sustainability. Based on the study of a specific firm located in northern Norway which has developed a scientific form of wildlife tourism, the main challenges are identified in the limited access to competent and dedicated human capital and the difficulties related to networking, especially in the local area. The case study suggests that the factors that contribute positively to the attractiveness of wildlife tourism are also the ones that tend to affect its development negatively. The peripheral location makes the tourist product exotic, but at the same time it makes the recruitment of qualified co-workers particularly challenging. Similarly, the peculiarities of the individual firm contribute to the uniqueness of the tourist product, but they can isolate the individual firm from the other actors of the local context. Based on the findings, policy implications and directions for further research are identified.

AB  - Society aims to develop frames for recognizing important geological and geomorphological sites and features or landscapes within their national and even transnational boundaries. Earth heritage sites educate the general public and preserve cultural and environmental matters. New trends of sustainable development, importance of site conservation are demanding that landforms and landscapes, rocks, minerals, fossils, soils should be protected legally, as they give understanding about the evolution of Mother Earth in local and regional context to generations. The Geopark concept was developed in cooperation with UNESCO and followed a large number of requests to UNESCO from all over the world, from geological institutions and geoscientists and non-governmental organizations, and it became extremely popular and influential to preserve those geological heritage areas, nowadays still recognized only nationally or not at all. This paper aims to give comprehensive overview of existing geoparks in the Baltic Sea Region, as well as analyze aspiring geoparks and unpublished initiatives of potential geopark (Livonia and Vooremaa) eventual establishment in frames of cultural and landscape preservation context. Criteria, requirements and earlier studies are given in context. The geoparks should mainly contain cultural and educational purpose while targeting the least possible damage in preservational aspect.

AB  - The paper explores how governing bodies and planning authorities in Norway take urban freight transport into consideration in three different cities. Based on empirical studies of actors and processes relevant to city planning, the paper highlights challenges related to integrating urban freight transport considerations in city planning. The paper demonstrates how different planning approaches shape the integration of urban freight transport in city planning. The paper shows that early integration of freight considerations and stakeholder engagement in city planning is vital for developing more effective and sustainable transport and freight systems in urban environments. Political anchorage, geographical scope, and time are also three dimensions that considerably influence the way urban freight transport is integrated in city planning. Insights from this analysis may be used to develop better ways of integrating freight transport into city planning in the future.

AB  - The importance of sustainability information on the social license to operate (SLO) in forestry-sawmilling businesses is on the rise. In addition, the applicability of existing regional and national corporate responsibility (CR) measurement systems for implementing collaborative production chain assessments is low. This study assesses collaboration opportunities for developing common CR reporting for non-industrial private forest (NIPF) landowners and independent small and medium-sized sawmills (i.e. SME sawmills). The material of the study is composed of two datasets gathered from the representatives of NIPF landowners and independent SME sawmill managers in Finland between August and October 2013 by using the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines as a reference. The data analysis employs Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique to evaluate the relative importance of CR indicators for forestry and sawmilling industries. Based on our results, the NIPF landowners and sawmill managers share similar views on CR reporting to a large extent in that both groups mostly value the same economic and social indicators, while at the same time they have seen mostly the same environmental indicators as insignificant. Emphasis on the economic and social issues is a positive sign in the operations of the forestry-sawmilling businesses for promoting the SLO, while for some environmental viewpoints contradictions may exist.

AB  - Sustainable development requires clean water. In Sweden, water supply has historically been good, but a changed climate may alter that situation. Islands such as oland and Gotland, which already have a strained water situation due to their location and bedrock, can be useful case studies for understanding how industries adapt and overcome obstacles in changing behaviour to be more sustainable. Focus groups and a postal questionnaire were conducted to study the water shortage mitigations of the tourism and agriculture industries. The results indicated four salient steps for these industries: awareness/knowledge, responsibility, behaviour and mitigation measures. While awareness was high among all respondents, the level of knowledge varied. Both the tourism and agriculture industries acknowledged their own responsibility but primarily placed the responsibility on each other and on other actors. All respondents had ideas about what behaviours needed to be changed in others, but not as much about their own behaviours, which is a natural consequence of the transfer of responsibility. Finally, there were many ideas for mitigation measures with the agricultural industry focusing on traditional approaches such as irrigation ponds and collecting rainwater, and the tourism industry having more innovative ideas such as re-circulating water and behaviour changes but had not progressed as far in their implementation. This study has shown that industries have different prerequisites and that providing them with tools to help them use preventive measures could speed up the transition to a more sustainable future.

AB  - Habitat composition is an important factor influencing nesting failure probability in birds. However, although various habitat effects such as fragmentation and edge density are known to have clear negative effects on the breeding success of passerines, the role that habitat composition plays in shaping nesting failure patterns among other avian groups is less well known. We studied nesting failure in a large forest raptor, the Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, during the period 1999-2003 in Finland. Illegal human persecution was found to constitute a major cause of failure among nests where cause could be determined accurately (comprising c. 60% of all failed nesting attempts). Egg predation by corvids and nestling predation by Eagle Owls Bubo bubo were also common. However, the exact cause of nesting failure could not be inferred in every case. Overall, the degree of initial parental investment (clutch size and egg volume) was significantly smaller in nests that failed than in nesting attempts that were successful. This did not apply to nests that were destroyed by humans, in which investment was at a level equal to nests that were successful. Although the probability that a nesting attempt would fail was also related to small-scale nest concealment, nesting failure probability was not associated with main prey density or several measures describing territorial habitat composition at larger scales. Small initial parental investment, not habitat composition, is thus the major correlate of nesting failure in Goshawks.

AB  - Lek area characteristics of capercaillie were studied in eastern Finland. Lekking site data of 42 leks were collected in spring 2000. Satellite images and the Geographical Information System were used to divide the landscape into eight classes and described by means of circles of 11 different sizes (radius 250 - 4000 m) around the leks. The leks were compared with the average landscape, represented by 50 random points, and studied according to male lek attendance. Mature forests and thinning forests were more abundant and advanced seedling stands less abundant around the leks than in an average landscape. Most of these differences extended up to 750 m distance from the lek. The number of males per lek was best explained by the proportion and patch size of the thinning forests. The effects of landscape structure on the number of cocks were detectable over a wide range, but were strongest within a radius of 1 - 2 km. The results are discussed in relation to landscape ecology and management applications.

AB  - Clear-cutting followed by even-aged forestry is transforming forests around the globe. There is growing concern that considerable parts of the native forest biodiversity will not be able to re-colonize these new stands before the next clear-cutting. The development of species assemblages during the full forestry rotation period must be understood in order to assess the need for management adaptations and to get a basis for their design. Knowledge is accumulating from studies of permanent plots before and shortly after clear-cutting, but for later stages only comparative studies have been published (space-for-time substitutions). In this study, I combined this comparative approach with direct monitoring of the pace of assemblage recovery in boreal stands regrown after clear-cutting half a century ago (treatment stands). I found little re-colonization in assemblages of mosses and liverworts between an initial survey to a resurvey 15 years later in 0.1-ha permanent plots of upland and stream-side forest. The assemblages of the treatment stands were still significantly different from those in matched old control forests that had never been clear-cut. The treatment stands had significantly fewer species of liverworts and of the substrate-based species subgroup "wood or bark", and the six most negatively affected species were liverworts more or less specialized to this substrate. The only significant recovery recorded over the 15 years was for the "rocks or boulders" subgroup in upland stands, probably related to a shadier and moister climate resulting from canopy development. During the inter-survey period, some of the upland treatment stands were thinned. All disfavored subgroups recovered less in thinned than in not thinned upland stands, most likely as a result of a return to lighter and drier microclimates and direct mechanical disturbance. The incomplete and slow recovery halfway into the forestry rotation period calls for action. Adaptation of thinning for conservation has rarely been implemented in boreal forest management, but has a large potential. To facilitate re-colonization by disfavored liverworts and mosses growing on wood or bark and/or under shaded and moist conditions, I suggest retention of unlogged patches during thinning and addition of coarse deadwood on the ground in these patches. Such measures would also favor re-colonization of other late-successional species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Narratives emerging from film and literature can be used as geopolitical tools for those working with place-making and promotion in the tourist industry. Film-induced tourism is a genre which in recent years has become increasingly relevant and has attracted attention in the context of regional development. The overarching concern of this article is to what extent film-induced heritage tourism can play a role in regional business development and in the mediation of history. After an initial discussion of the field, the article reflects critically on its key issues on the basis of a case study. In 2008, Agder Research undertook a culture-based business project which centred on a film about the historical phenomenon of children's migrations (barnevandring) in Southern Norway. The film was entitled Yohan - Barnevandrer (YOHAN - The Child Wanderer) and was released in 2010. The article presents some of the observations that emerged from the project through action research. The business project is also contextualised internationally and in relation to three Swedish narrative tourist destinations: Am tourism; Astrid Lindgren tourism; and Vilhelm Moberg tourism. The investigations reveal that success in this area demands much of practitioners. Ultimately, the article calls for a much more critical engagement with the possibilities of film tourism than is currently typical.

AB  - This paper analyses the gap between planning theory and planning practice in Swedish infrastructure planning. Planning theory was of limited relevance in order to understand the planning processes and the documents. Instead sociology, political theory and philosophy appeared as useful theoretical resources. Bourdieu's theories on social and cultural capital, and 'the feel for the game' were useful in understanding planning practice. In order to develop communicative planning theory into a useful asset for planning practice the system perspective and the emphasis on public spheres from Habermas communicative action theory, critical realism and political pluralism might well serve as theoretical point of departures.

AB  - 1. Increasing degradation of ecological conditions in streams because of human activities has prompted widespread restoration attempts; however, the ecological consequences of restoration remain poorly understood. We explored the effects of restoration through placement of boulders into the channel in the Ume River catchment in northern Sweden, where tributary streams were extensively channelized to facilitate the transport of timber in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Retentiveness and breakdown of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), two key ecological functions in low-order streams most likely to be affected by channelization, were compared between restored, channelized and unimpacted reference stream sites.
   2. Artificial leaves were used to assess short-term CPOM retentiveness, while CPOM breakdown was estimated as the mass loss of alder (Alnus spp.) leaf packs placed in coarse mesh litter bags. Also, the taxonomic richness, abundance, biomass and evenness of the leaf-eating invertebrates (shredders) on the retrieved leaf material were quantified. Detailed field measurements were carried out to identify geomorphological and hydraulic controls of CPOM retentiveness and breakdown at the study sites.
   3. CPOM retentiveness reflected most strongly the density of boulders and submerged woody debris at the study sites. Restored sites were on average twice as retentive as channelized sites and significantly more retentive than reference sites when discharge was controlled.
   4. Current velocity at bank-full flow was the single most important predictor of CPOM mass loss, implying that mechanical fragmentation was substantial during high flows; other apparent controls of CPOM breakdown included water temperature and shredder abundance. CPOM mass loss was similar between restored and reference sites. However, breakdown was slightly faster at most channelized sites, consistent with higher hydraulic stress during high flow conditions. The shredder assemblages that colonized the litter bags were similar in richness, abundance, biomass and evenness between treatments.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In channelized forest streams, low retentiveness and fast mechanical fragmentation during high flows contribute to the rapid depletion of benthic CPOM following leaf abscission in autumn, thereby weakening the heterotrophic energy pathways that probably support much of the biological production in these systems. Our results illustrate that restoration by replacement of boulders can successfully reverse these impacts of channelization and thus contribute to the efficient ecological functioning of impacted streams.

AB  - This paper covers some of the pressing problems of the Arctic Ocean, the existing structures and how cooperation in the region may develop. The region is surrounded by the lands of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, who together formed the Arctic Council in recognition of the fact that the issues facing the north exceed the capabilities and capacities of any one country and that successful solutions must be built on common actions. The expense and difficulty of operating in extreme conditions of the Arctic forced much of the significant arctic research into cooperative bilateral or multilateral projects, usually with a discrete research objective. Global organizations including the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) sponsor specific climate related programs in the Arctic. The warming trends in the Arctic provide the motivation for renewed attention on the Arctic, which is changing rapidly both environmentally and socially. The climate and pollution issues, both anthropogenic in origin, have created some priorities in governmental thinking and led to limited additional funding in recent years. Industry needs, to be responsive and innovative in incorporating stringent control and monitoring into development projects and in contributing to research and environmental management. Collective efforts by all interested governments will be needed to address the scarcity of research and observations, extending from the oceans to the coastal areas and drainage,basins of the hinterlands. Arctic countries must also pursue global arrangements to protect the Arctic from the impacts of pollution from outside areas. The work started by the Arctic Council needs to be bolstered by the establishment of a regional convention for the Arctic, which will confer more responsibility upon governments to continue with the programs.

AB  - To carry out research and education in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) area, Fudan University (China) and the University of Turku (Finland) jointly launched a double Master's degree programme in Information and Communication Technology called FuTuRe (Fudan-Turku Rethinking Education). The programme aims at providing world-class engineering education to meet the demands of skilled engineers set by the modern and global information society. Our research will build on and contribute to previous research done about double degree programmes by focusing on the critical factors in creating an international double degree programme from the perspectives of the programme leadership, faculty and most importantly the participating students. We discuss and analyse key findings of designing, implementing and running the programme especially concentrating on the curriculum design, learning methods and programme management not to forget cultural perspectives. We answer the question why to promote international cooperation, how to develop double degree programmes especially in the Sino-Finnish context, how to find strategic fit between the Finnish and Chinese education systems, what barriers existed in launching this programme and what measures have been taken to solve them.

TI  - From Bergen to Moscow - Nordahl Grieg's road to Communism (Norweigan political literature)
T2  - HISTORISK TIDSSKRIFT
LA  - Norwegian
AB  - Nordahl Grieg (1902-1943) is known to Norwegian schoolchildren for his poems of defiance after the German attack on Norway in April 1940. Rather less is known about his past as a communist intellectual. His biographers have discussed the theme, but they have not had access to the Russian archive sources used in this article. In 1927, Grieg was already established in Norway as a well-known author, poet, critic and playwright. He left for China in January that year to cover the Chinese civil war for Norwegian newspapers. In China he befriended the chief Comintern advisor to Guomindang, Mikhail Gruzenberg, alias Borodin, who had lived in Norway a few years earlier and obviously took a keen interest in the young Norwegian. Through Borodin, Grieg came into close contact with Madame Sun Yat-sen, who still played a central role in Guomindang politics. It seems that his stay in China had a decisive influence on him. At the very least it made him receptive to the logic of the revolutionary role of the Soviet Union in culture, economics and society. However, there are numerous doubts as to his political inclinations in the following years. While Norwegian radical at the time considered him a reactionary, the word "fascist" was even used, we know that his immediate family was of conservative stock, and that he was financially dependent on his brother, the publisher Harald Grieg of the Gyldendal publishing house. Many years later, Harald Grieg related that his brother had embarked on a revolutionary path at least by 1932. Nordahl Grieg went to the Soviet Union in February 1933 to study theatre, and did not return to Norway until December 1934. In Moscow, the Authors' Union took him under their wing and he became a close friend of the Russian author Boris Pilnyak and studied theatre under Vsevelod Meyerhold. He fell in love with a Russian woman, Vega Linde, with whom he lived for some time. After his return to his native town of Bergen, he made a reputation for himself as an outspoken defender of everything the Soviet Union stood for, from art to politics and war war in the case of Finland. His plays were inspired by revolutionary theatre, and they all were severely critical of the prevailing society in the West. His most important contribution to the cause of the Soviet Union, though, might have been the political journal Veien Frem in 1936-37. Financially, it was supported by the Comintern, and he received editorial guidance from VOKS, the Organisation of Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries under the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The defiant and militant Stalinist woman of Kira Dimitrovna from his 1938 novel Ung Ma Verden Ennu Vaere became the symbol for Norwegian communists of the time. Seen in this perspective, Nordahl Grieg became what has been called a communist cultural worker. However, with the advent of war in 1940, his role changed, if not his attitude. For the rest of his days he came to symbolise Norwegian resistance to the German occupation of Norway. He was killed in December 1943 aboard a British bomber shot down over Berlin.

AB  - With the rise of the concept of a forest-based bioeconomy over the past decade, sustainability is simultaneously an underlying assumption and a key expectation. However, can we assume that a bioeconomy is sustainable simply because it emphasizes the use of forests as a renewable resource? And will a forest-based bioeconomy indeed lead to a more sustainable - and prosperous - Finnish society? In light of these questions, it is important to understand the relationship between Finnish forestry and sustainability as articulated in current and past forest policy documents. We ask how the concept of sustainability is framed and translated in forest policy objectives, and what ambitions are put forward when challenges and problems are defined, specific methods are proposed, and emphasis is given. Our findings indicate that although the language used in the policies generally refers to sustainability, the various dimensions of sustainability are not equally considered, with economic ambitions being particularly valued. There is a risk that a forest-based bioeconomy will simply continue forestry business as-usual if current problematizations and proposed solutions reflected in forest policy remain unchallenged.Our aim is to provide a more nuanced understanding of possible opportunities and risks for sustainability linked to a forest-based bioeconomy as currently promoted in Finland and elsewhere. We do this by analysing the meta-discourses which have been present in Finnish forest policy documents over time. Furthermore, we identify and discuss possible trade-offs and their implications for Finnish forests and society in informing current and future forest policy reviews and increasing transparency.

AB  - Certain weaknesses in large carnivore conservation policies have led to a form of political dissent and resistance against dominant conservation regimes, manifested most clearly in the drastic decrease in the Finnish wolf population in 2014. The illegal hunting of large carnivores has been carried out by a particular social group with the support of community members, and hunting violators have been viewed as benefactors by many of their fellow citizens. In the attempt to understand how rural communities sustain alternative ways of regulating their worlds, and how community members negate shame and stigma on behalf of hunting violators, the neutralization techniques presented in the sociological literature by Sykes and Matza provide an effective tool. In collecting the data, we used non-active role playing with empathy-based fictional stories. We obtained a total of 231 narratives from a core group of hunting violators, within which we identified the use of the nine different techniques. These discourses express how a rural identity and way of life is defended and how rural protests against conservation policies are expressed under the pressure of modern conservation regimes. The results address the importance of acknowledging biosecurity issues in wolf territories, of placing a value on local knowledge, and of strengthening trust between the locals and the authorities in implementing responsive and deliberative governance; they also suggest how to formulate effective deterrents to illegal killing and increase compliance with conservation regimes by informal sanctions, based on collective moral judgments and the perceived legitimacy of rules.

AB  - The National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden (NILS) is a large-scale, sample-based monitoring program that combines aerial photointerpretation with field inventory to follow landscape-scale biophysical conditions and changes. A statistical power analysis was conducted before the NILS program began in 2003 with the aim to determine an appropriate sampling effort and compare some design alternatives. The chosen sampling effort was then evaluated in a second power analysis conducted just before the first 5-year re-inventory rotation started. The latter power analysis revealed which magnitude of actual change might be detected within the future for different central monitoring variables. This article reports results from these power analyses and discusses our experiences in using power analysis as a tool for designing large-scale monitoring programs. The results showed that even quite small changes in the more common variables, such as land cover types and more common plant species, can be detected on the national scale. However, on the regional scale, or for less common variables, changes will be more difficult to detect. The power analyses have revealed the size level of changes that will be possible to detect. The results have also generated incentives for further improvements of NILS, e.g., input to the modification and revision of the variable content, flow and hierarchy, and incentives for launching other complementary monitoring programs connected to NILS. They have also created a basis for a better and more user-oriented communication of results from NILS to different stakeholders.

AB  - Compared to most other wealthy countries, Norwegian producers and consumers have been somewhat sheltered from the international market, but this has changed over the last decades. As a response to these changes, the number of community supported agriculture (CSA) farms, has grown rapidly in Norway. This article reveals, in depth, why Norwegian producers and consumers engage in CSA and how CSA can be seen as a transformational act toward food system changes. The study reveals that the Norwegian CSA producers, and consumers in general, have distinct values and are motivated by a desire of a production and food system, that safeguards aspects of environment, justice, health, participation, and communication. For them, the farms are an arena for converting societal values into practical actions. The sustainable production methods practiced-and the reallocation of power back to the producers, consumers, and local community-are indicative of the transformational power CSA has had upon the current agri-food system regime. However, the challenge is to upscale these actions, as well as prevent dilution of the core values and agroecological practices seen in the Norwegian CSAs.

AB  - Mining regions in different parts of the world have been associated with the significant pollution of water, sediments, and soils by manganese and other chemical elements. This study assessed the degree of geochemical transformation caused by open-pit extraction and processing of mineral resources in the Kovdorsky District of Murmansk Oblast, 20 km from the Russia-Finland border. A second objective was to predict further changes co-driven by industrial pressure and high climatic instability in the polar region. The field study involved sampling water and sediments from virgin background streams and from the tailings storage facility, settling ponds, rivers, and lakes affected by ore mining and disintegration. Laboratory analyses included the study of elemental composition, redox potential, alkalinity and acidity, organic matter content, and other geochemical characteristics for a better understanding of pollutant migration patterns. We revealed elevated levels of potentially toxic elements in surface waters and bottom sediments which pose a risk to the human health via the household and drinking water supply. Pollution with manganese (Mn) was found to be the major environmental issue. Its natural presence in the river water was overridden a hundredfold by anthropogenic enrichment. This is problematic as Mn is easily bioaccumulated, which can lead to unwanted ecotoxicological effects, and-in the case of prolonged exposure to high doses of Mn and its compounds-to detrimental human health impacts. We believe that the changing climate may raise the water flow and thus expand the area of the hydrochemical anomaly. On the other hand, the activation of self-purification and dilution processes could lead to decreasing environmental Mn concentrations.

AB  - The analysis of the neighboring countries economical activities is indispensable input into the economic recovery process. The Baltic States regions territory has incontestably attractive economical political location. However, the biggest part of the neighboring countries investments flow is distributed to other partner territories. The research object is the Swedish direct investments flow. Historically, the Swedish capital had a noticeable impact on the Latvian national economy: trade, manufacture, services and education. Nevertheless, a share of the Swedish capital in the total fixed-capital assets of the Latvian companies as well as the targeted economy branch choice in the latest decade period has fluctuation tendency. The primary focus is to specify the fundamental range of influence on the models the territorial sustainable economic development. The research goal is the analysis of the territorial particularities and characteristics. The investigation comprises such territory developments aspects as capacity of the vacant land, attitude between urbanization and manufacturing capacity's allocation, inland resources and its potential, history of the country's economically political collaboration. The current scientific article contains a study of the leading branches of the Swedish business inland and attraction and use of the resources from the partner countries. The authors study results on the European climate change until 2035 gained from the ENSEMBLES projects results data are used to formulate conceptualization of the Swedish partner model on the territorial sustainable development. According to one of the conclusions, the overseas foreign direct investments. share is dominated over the Swedish land partner countries share in the companies' fixed-capital assets. The similar tendency characterizes the Latvian state territory's economic policy, which might not be expedient. The carried research is a part of the investigation on the models of the Latvian powerful neighbor countries investments allocation. The results will be applied for the Latvian territory's economic planning model.

AB  - The paper reports on a study of community gardening in Stockholm. We contribute to the body of knowledge about the sustainability of community gardens and this new form of citizen-led initiatives in Stockholm, with the ambition of creating a debate about the best way to sustain and develop these initiatives in Sweden. We argue that although community gardening may provide leverage for means of developing a sustainable city, it is a marginal phenomenon and contributes little to sustainable development its present form. Through interviews we have investigated how the citizens and municipality officers of Stockholm try to adapt to the renewed interest in community gardening by looking at the policy makers', municipality officers' and grassroots movements' incentives to start community gardens. We specifically focus on how the community gardeners articulate their reasons for participating in collaborative initiatives in the city and how these expectations evolve when they are faced with the reality of gardening and the problems relating to producing food in the city. We have found that there are a growing number of citizens and local authorities advocating community gardening, but the sustainability and endurance of gardens are hampered by vague responsibilities, lack of leadership and unclear expectations of the outcome. Community gardening cases in Stockholm contribute to the debate by exemplifying how formal (e.g. policy making) and informal advocacy (e.g. civic engagement in community gardening) groups are collaborating, but also showing that they often have different agendas and initial motivations for setting up new gardens. We argue that uncritical enthusiasm results in an overly instrumental approach to governance of community gardening and that the sustainability and endurance of the community gardening is not an issue that the governing bodies plan for, and hence it is forgotten. We suggest some routes forward, involving employing facilitators from various stakeholders such as the municipality, housing companies and various NGOs.

AB  - This paper employs an assemblage theoretical approach to analyse how Norwegian land-based wind power policies are constructed over time and what forces dominate and resist wind power policy development. The entanglement of policies, technology deployment and (lack of) social acceptance emphasizes the need to critically question what and who influence the construction of energy transition policies and how and what concerns are left out, especially in relation to the tenets of energy justice. We find that wind power policies are primarily influenced by energy authorities, developers and interest organizations, furthering arguments of climate concerns, energy security and economic opportunity. The emerging voices of local governments, environmental organizations and concerned citizens claim new political engagement related to valuations of (local) environmental, distributional and procedural justice and the recognition of alternative future energy imaginaries. The increase in conflicts and public debates has challenged national politicians to play a more active role in wind power policy making, which entails the reconsideration of wind power as an energy policy and critically judging what, for whom and how wind power should contribute to local, national and global energy transitions.

AB  - Climate adaptation measures address the challenges that densification and climate change impose on the urban environment. Sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) constructs include the introduction of natural elements, such as riparian buffers, vegetative filters, rain beds, water spills, watermark filters, retainers and dams, and are an integral part of these climate adaptation measures. SUDS are commonly undertaken at a municipal level in Norway but, unfortunately, the implementation of SUDS projects has lagged behind expectation. Norway is a normative and egalitarian society, where public resistance to local projects is a factor in the delayed adoption of SUDS. That is why a greater understanding of public perceptions and priorities is needed to build consensus and support for these climate adaptation measures. This research looked at the Blaklibekken SUDS case study in Trondheim, Norway. A cross-section of interviews with the municipality and users was undertaken to establish themes within local perceptions of the project. Themes of environmental benefit, child-related activities, maintenance of the site and funding were established to provide a better understanding of public expectations and what aspects of the project correlated with public acceptance or resistance. This work provides a starting point for further research to establish public 'themes of interest' that can provide decision makers greater insight into public priorities.

AB  - Altogether 335 species of saproxylic beetles were collected by Malaise, window and emergence traps in a 33 ha forest reserve in southern Norway, during the years 1992-1997. Most species are associated with deciduous trees, particularly oak, and the majority depend on decayed wood or fungi. The forest is a mixture of Norway spruce and deciduous trees and is characterized as being very close to a primeval forest. Sixty-two species of the collected beetles are assumed to be threatened or rare in Scandinavia, 52 species are on the Red Data List in Sweden and 43 species are suggested for a similar list in Norway. Fifteen species are on a list of species threatened in the Nordic region. Compared with other thoroughly sampled forest reserves in Fennoscandia, the forest investigated had one of the richest saproxylic beetle communities known to date. The main reasons for this are assumed to be the abundance of dead wood, the diverse tree composition and the fact that the area had been inaccessible for forest harvesting due to the lack of transportation for timber.

AB  - The study compares populations of two typical open farmland bird species, the skylark and the meadow pipit, on fields with open in-field and subsurface drainage systems in Finland. Data are derived from the national monitoring of farmland birds for 2002-2009 and are based on territory mapping. Generalised additive mixed models with repeated measures were used to investigate territory density and temporal population trends of the species on crop and grassland fields with two types of drainage. The results provided evidence for a higher habitat value of fields under open drainage (ODF) than fields with subsurface drainage (SDF) for the meadow pipit at any given year. Both species' trends were significantly positive on ODF while trends on SDF were not significantly directional. This strongly suggests that foraging resources and nest survival of individuals breeding in ODF habitats rise above those of SDF habitats. The retention of the remaining ODF as part of the agri-environmental and relevant land-use policies could contribute to stabilisation and enhancement of populations of farmland birds for regions in Europe and elsewhere with the need for drainage.

AB  - High-resolution pollen profiles based on 30 cores taken from Estonian lake and mire deposits were used to reconstruct the extent and type of land-use over most of the Holocene. Biostratigraphical studies combining pollen records, archaeological investigations, conventional and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and numerical analysis were used to detect human impact on the landscape and vegetation. Indications of human activity were traced back to the Mesolithic (90004900 cal. BC) and are reflected in the pollen diagram by a wide range of anthropogenic indicators, which constitute nearly half of the total pollen sum, together with high charcoal content. Human impact during the Mesolithic is also indicated by the rarefaction analysis, which shows a doubling of palynological diversity. The Neolithic (4900-1800 cal. BC) is regarded as a transitional period between the pre-agrarian Mesolithic and the agrarian Bronze Age (1800-500 cal. BC). Changes in vegetation composition attributed to Late Mesolithic (6400-4900 cal. BC) land-use were found in several of the sites investigated. Pollen records display the development and intensive use of a pastoral landscape in the Middle Neolithic (41503200 cal. BC), expressed in pollen diagrams as a drop in the frequencies of broad-leaved trees and an increase in Picea abies, herb pollen and palynological diversity and in some cases increase in charcoal frequencies. Primitive tillage probably occurred during the Middle Neolithic, at least in the alvar (flat terrain with a thin soil cover on carbonaceous bedrock) and coastal areas of Estonia. The earliest Cerealia pollen finds are dated to ca. 4000 cal. BC and represented by Avena-type and Hordeum-type pollen. During the Bronze Age, crop cultivation played an important role in the farming economy. The beginning of crop cultivation in Estonia was almost simultaneous with southern Sweden, but more than 1000 years earlier than in Finland. The adoption of arable farming in Estonia occurred much later than in southern Sweden. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates how the Swedish forest industry, as represented by the three largest Swedish private forest companies (Svenska Cellulosa AB, Stora Enso, and Holmen), through their main public relations (PR) channels frame the current dominant Swedish forestry model and alternative models that are promoted by the European Union (EU). The content analysis of the three companies' trade magazines published between 2019 and 2022 explores the patterns in the PR framing of the forest management models with respect to economic, environmental, and social aspects. The time interval is centered by the July 2021 announcement of the EU's new Forest Strategy for 2030. The magazines' target audience is private forest owners, from whom Svenska Cellulosa AB, Stora Enso, and Holmen buy 40-50% of the timber used in production. The main finding of the study is that these corporations did not present alternative methods as viable options to replace the Swedish forestry model. The magazines, with some individual variations, respond to the alternative methods promoted by the EU and environmental associations by an increased emphasis on the benefits, mainly environmental, of the Swedish forestry model - framing the model as not only the most profitable but also the most ecologically sustainable.

AB  - The initiation of agri-environmental schemes (AES) to improve habitats for breeding waders may not show expected benefits in all situations. We show this, using results from a study of breeding waders on 469 grassland fields in the Danish Wadden Sea area. Numbers of breeding waders were not restored to levels of the recent past, even though Lapwings Vanellus vanellus, Black-tailed Godwits Limosa limosa and Redshanks Tringa totanus were drawn to wet permanent grasslands with AES. We had expected that more waders would be attracted by improved surface water retention during the breeding period due to the AES. However, AES were not introduced to all fields, and this measure did not dramatically change the water regime in part of the breeding fields. Furthermore, dry grasslands and fields that had been cultivated or drained before did not attract more waders, despite the introduction of the AES. The results suggest that the interplay between surface water retention and former farming history are important determinants of the habitat choice for breeding waders. The study emphasises the need for pre-defined success criteria, thorough analysis of the nature of the habitat and consideration of population processes before initiation of an AES, so that realistic management goals are defined and expected benefits can be achieved.

AB  - What are the implications of a decentralized model of healthcare governance? This case study on patient choice in Sweden is an attempt to shed light on this issue. Due to decentralization and constitutional rights of self-determination, the regional authorities in Sweden, called County Councils (CCs), have far-reaching rights to manage the healthcare sector. The fact that patient choice is considered to be a soft law or a soft governance regulation, opens it up to regional variation. To examine the CCs level of support of patient choice, an index is presented. The Patient Choice Index (PCI) shows that there is extensive variation among the CCs. To explain the causes of these variations, a number of hypotheses are tested. The analyses imply that ideology and economy, and more specifically the CCs' governing majorities and running net profits, are major explanations for the level of support.
   A number of conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study. In short, the CCs appear to act according to a local point of view, which means that there is no functioning national patient choice standard, and thus patients do not have equal access to healthcare and patients' rights are unevenly distributed. Furthermore, the CCs' financial conditions and governing majorities seem to undermine equivalent reform realization in a national context. In summary, the results of this study emphasize the conflict between regional self-governance and national equality, which is particularly visible in the decentralized Swedish healthcare model.

AB  - Results-oriented approaches are widely regarded as an effective means to improving cost-effectiveness of agri-climate-environment schemes. We designed a hypothetical payment-by-results scheme for biodiversity conservation on environmental grasslands in Finland. The scheme would pay farmers a premium if the site contains a set number of indicator species, which were selected based on vascular plant surveys of the target habitat type. We presented the hypothetical scheme to 20 farmers and six experts (researchers, officials and advisors) in agricultural policy for their opinions on the payment-by-result approach generally and the hypothetical scheme specifically. The indicator species list proved suitable for identifying sites with high total species richness of vascular plants and also appeared feasible in the eyes of the farmers. Farmers were mostly positive about the approach and, mainly, thought their peers and society at large would receive it positively. The main concerns were about implementation, especially verifying the biodiversity results. People working for the national control body were the most critical and could not see how the hypothetical scheme could fit into the current institutionalised programme. Experience in other countries may provide solutions for overcoming such obstacles. The results are highly relevant for a discourse on social experimentation and cost-efficient delivery of public goods for public money. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the new objectives laid out by the European Union's Common Agriculture Policy is increasing environmental sustainability. In this paper we compare the degree of average dependence index for each member state (ADIMS) in EU28 from 2007 to 2019 in order to verify the following: (1) whether there was a difference in this index when comparing two CAP periods-(a) from 2007 to 2013 and (b) from 2014 to 2019-and (2) which crops had a larger effect on the ADIMS. The study showed no significant variation in the average ADIMS at EU level between the first (2007-2013) and second (2014-2019) CAP periods. The AIDMS index highlighted three types of EU agriculture: (1) agriculture in Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, characterized by a high level of ADIMS (10.7-22) due to the widespread cultivation of oil crops as rapeseed and sunflower; (2) Mediterranean agriculture including Portugal, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Malta, Cyprus and France with lower AIDMS levels (5.3-10.3) given their heterogeneous crop portfolios with different degrees of dependence on animal pollination (almond, soy, rapeseed, sunflower and tomatoes) and (3) continental agriculture including Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Baltic countries, Benelux, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, which are characterized by the lowest ADIMS level (0.7-10.6) due to the widespread cultivation of cereals (anemophily and self-pollination) which increase the denominator of the index. The study suggests that a sustainable management of the agroecosystem will be possible in the future only if CAP considers pollinators' requirements by quantifying the timing and spatial food availability from cultivated and uncultivated areas.

AB  - There is a need to examine long-term changes in nitrogen leaching from arable soils. The purpose of this study was to analyse variations in specific leaching rates (kg ha(-1) per year) and gross load (Mg per year) of N from arable land to watercourses in Sweden from a historical perspective. The start of the study was set to 1865 because information on crop distribution, yield and livestock has been compiled yearly since then. The SOIL/SOILN model was used to calculate nitrogen leaching. Calculations were done for cereals, grass and bare fallow for three different soil types in nine agricultural regions covering a range of climatic conditions. Results indicate that both specific leaching rates and gross load of nitrogen in the middle of 19th century were approximately the same as they are today for the whole of south and central Sweden. Three main explanations for this were (1) large areas of bare fallow typical for the farming practice at the time; (2) enhanced mineralisation from newly cultivated land; and (3) low yield. From 1865, i.e. the start of the calculations, N leaching rates decreased and were at their lowest around 1930. During the same period, gross load was also at its lowest despite the fact that the acreage of arable land was at its most extensive. After 1930, average leaching increased by 60% and gross load by 30%, both reaching a peak in the mid-1970s to be followed by a declining trend. The greatest increase in leaching was in regions where the increase in animal density was largest and these regions were also those where the natural conditions for leaching such as mild winters and coarse-textured soils were found. Extensive draining projects occurred during the period of investigation, in particular an intensive exploitation of lakes and wetlands. This caused a substantial drop in nitrogen retention and the probable increase in net load to the sea might thus have been more affected by this decrease in retention than the actual increase in gross load.

AB  - The sustainable intensification of farming systems is expected to increase food supply and reduce the negative environmental effects of agriculture. It is also seen as an effective adaptation and mitigation strategy in response to climate change. Our aim is to determine farmers' and other stakeholders' views on how higher crop yields can be achieved from their currently low levels. This was investigated in two stakeholder workshops arranged in North Savo, Finland, in 2014 and 2016. The workshop participants, who were organized in discussion groups, considered some agricultural policies to discourage the improvement of crop yields. Policy schemes were seen to support extensification and reduce the motivation for yield improvements. However, the most important means for higher crop yields indicated by workshop participants were improved soil conditions with drainage and liming, in addition to improved crop rotations, better sowing techniques, careful selection of cultivars and forage grass mixtures. Suggested solutions for improving both crop yields and farm income also included optimized use of inputs, focusing production at the most productive fields and actively developed farming skills and knowledge sharing. These latter aspects were more pronounced in 2016, suggesting that farmers' skills are increasingly being perceived as important.

AB  - We studied movements of the noctuid moths Xestia speciosa and X. fennica in a fragmented forest landscape including old-growth spruce forest corridors in eastern Finland. We individually marked and released 1,796 adults of the habitat generalist X. speciosa and 683 individuals of X. fennica, which prefers old-growth spruce forests. Moths were recaptured with 60 sugar-bait traps that were placed within habitat corridors, in the non-habitat matrix and in surrounding old-growth forest patches. Both species favoured the corridors during their movements and tended to avoid entering the matrix. We analysed recapture rates and movements of the recaptured moths. Results suggest that X. speciosa moves longer distances than X. fennica. Though corridors clearly canalized movements by both species, the impact of old-growth forest corridors at the larger landscape scale was less clear in X. fennica. Movement behaviour of the two sexes differed more than that of the two species.

AB  - This paper presents a perspective we find lacking in the general discussion on urban transformative capacity, as well as the discourse on children's environmental experiences and their participation in urban planning processes. Children contribute to the building of urban transformative capacity in several ways. Firstly, they contribute with new perspectives on the environment that broaden existing perspectives on human-environment relations in urban planning. Secondly, children's participation in planning processes challenges existing power relations through the creation of new adult-child relationships which in turn transform relations between adults and other actors and agencies. Thirdly, their participation requires changes in planning practices and the establishment of new routines in order to plan cities which meet the needs of children.

AB  - This study examines tourism professionals' perceptions of climate change and their reactions to the associated challenges. Sixteen in-depth interviews with tourism professionals who work at Arctic destinations in Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark (i.e. Greenland), reveal that the professionals acknowledge several pressing issues arising from climate change, such as glacier retreating and snow shortfall. It discovers one salient adaptation action in association with snow-related activities. Further, three streams of driving forces prompt the professionals to devise sustainable mitigation actions entailing (1) staging socially responsible and wellbeing tourist experiences, (2) implementing waste programmes friendly to the Arctic ecosystem, and (3) cultivating eco-friendly practices through certifications and educational programmes. Lastly, to further construe the attitudes of tourism professionals, this study elicits the Climate Resilience Model on Arctic Tourism, characterizing the interplay among climate impacts, driving forces, and climate actions by the tourism business across four Arctic nations under study.

AB  - Centralized management of large carnivore populations in rural and remote landscapes used by local people often leads to conflicts between the objectives of wildlife conservation and rural development. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of wolves indirectly reduces landowner revenues from traditional small game hunting, and that landowner revenues are more variable closer to wolf territories. The assumed mechanism is that hunters fear that their economically and culturally valuable hunting dogs may be killed by wolves, which results in reduced hunting, and thus reduced revenues for landowners where and when wolves occur. To determine the effect of wolf presence on revenues from sport hunting, we obtained data from 1990 to 2009 on income from small game management areas, in Hedmark and Oppland Counties in Norway, as well as locations of wolf territories. Small game management areas experienced increased sport hunting revenue with increasing distance to the closest wolf territory. Also, inter-annual variation in revenue decreased with increasing distance from wolf territories. Thus, wolf presence may reduce landowners' revenues from small game hunting, and cause higher economic variability in rural communities. It is important to note that while the economic impacts of wolves may be compensated where governments have the will and the economic resources, the impacts on the lifestyles of rural people (e.g. hunter's fear of losing prized dogs to wolves) will remain controversial.

This paper intends to provide a broader picture of the Norwegian education system and the changes it has undergone in order to accommodate to technological advancements and the internationalization of education. In addition, the development of the intercultural communicative competence has become a prerequisite in Norway's multicultural and multilingual society characterized by increased mobility. Therefore, Norway's educational landscape and educational policies needed to accommodate these changes and transfer the acquired knowledge into clear pedagogical aims.

AB  - 1. Deer numbers have increased dramatically throughout Europe and North America over the last century, but empirical analyses of variation in harvesting and the influence of biological and cultural factors are lacking.
   2. We examined trends in size and composition of red deer Cervus elaphus harvests over the last three to four decades in 11 European countries with contrasting deer productivity, management strategies and hunting traditions.
   3. The harvest increased exponentially in all countries except Austria and Germany, where it was stable, and Poland, where it has declined in recent years. Harvest growth rates ranged from 0.009 in Austria to 0.075 in Sweden and depended on the management system and harvest composition, being negatively related to the proportion of females in the adult harvest.
   4. Within four focal countries (France, Hungary, Norway and Scotland), there was considerable spatial variation in harvest growth rates. These tended to be higher in recently colonized areas than in traditional hunting areas and were often higher than the maximum possible population growth rate. Range expansion was an important component of the increase in total harvest in France and Scotland, but not in Hungary or Norway.
   5. Harvest composition was available for seven countries, all of which showed a strong increase in the proportion of calves in the harvest. The sex ratio of the adult harvest was relatively stable, being strongly male-biased in Norway and marginally female-biased elsewhere. The proportion of males in the harvest was unrelated to trophy hunting objectives.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our study emphasizes that cultural aspects of management need to be accounted for, as well as biological factors, when interpreting the patterns of harvest growth and composition across Europe. Widespread sustained harvest growth has occurred, suggesting continued growth of deer populations with consequent social and economic impacts. Population control is therefore a major challenge for the future, currently hampered by inadequate population data and a decreasing number of hunters in some countries. Increasing the motivation of hunters to harvest female deer is one possible solution, although this may conflict with hunting traditions and economic considerations in some areas.

AB  - Carnivore depredation gives rise to direct costs for killed and injured animals as well as indirect costs due to productivity losses and additional labor requirements. Our aim was to investigate indirect costs to sheep farmers in Sweden due to carnivore depredation and presence. We estimated these costs using survey data describing conditions in 2013. Reproduction and time spent on fence maintenance and taking care of animals were analyzed to isolate effects of carnivore exposure from other factors that affect these variables. Results indicate that both high carnivore densities and attacks are associated with comparatively lower sheep reproduction. Farmers who experienced an attack spent much more on labor for maintaining fences, searching for lost animals, and bringing the animals in for the night. Results suggest that the indirect cost per adult female sheep is EUR23 for nonattacked herds in areas with high carnivore densities; EUR71 in herds that were attacked and where sheep are kept on fenced grazing land; and EUR100 on attacked summer-pasture farms, where free-range grazing is applied. A flat rate compensation per adult female sheep, differentiated between herds in areas with high carnivore density that have not been attacked and herds that have been attacked could be used to compensate sheep farmers for these costs.

AB  - Informed by the concept of strategy making, this paper analyses the ability of spatial planning to support local climate change transitions towards sustainable transportation in two case studies of planning in Swedish municipalities with comparatively high climate ambitions. The analysis shows that the expectations on planning to effect change need to be moderated. Not even in these climate-ambitious municipalities did transportation planning result in strategic reorientation. While climate change was clearly filtered into local strategy making, no new climate frame was established. Rather in goals, it was linked to an overall attractive city storyline. Transportation planners have sought to mobilize force through developing new tools and routines to strengthen the role of climate change. In detailed planning, however, when plans become legally binding, agency in relation to climate change was limited by allowing private actors a pivotal position. Also, tools were used selectively and when settling priorities, climate change was subordinate to economic growth interests. While the planning observed can be regarded as weak, its ability to support climate transition would have been even weaker had it not been linked to the attractive city storyline. Consequently, to facilitate climate transition mobilizing force needs to be generated within the current local implementation structure.

AB  - The winter ecology of the Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis was studied in northern Finland in 1991-95. The data consist of 26 radiomarked hawks, of which 331 day and 299 night positions were located. Average range size was 9894 ha for males (minimum convex polygon, n = 43 and 6282 ha for females Cn = 11). Ranges calculated by the 75% harmonic mean contour gave range areas of 3283 ha for males (n= 3> and 2753 ha for females (n = 11). Harmonic mean centres concentrated near human settlements, implying better food availability there compared with woodland areas. Some Goshawks preyed upon animals living in the city dump in late winter. Goshawks preferred deciduous and mature conifer forests and avoided open areas such as fields and bogs. They also avoided very heterogeneous sites. The winter diet consisted mostly of Mountain Hares Lt-pus timidus (30.9%), Red Squirrels Sciurus vulgaris (23.6%), Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus (12.7%) and forest grouse Tetraonidae (27.1%), of which Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix was the most important (14.5%). By weight, hares constituted 70% of the biomass consumed.

AB  - Over the last four decades the eradication of rats from islands around New Zealand has moved from accidental eradication following the exploratory use of baits for rat control to carefully planned complex eradications of rats and cats (Felis catus) on large islands. Introduced rodents have now been eradicated from more than 90 islands. Of these successful campaigns, those on Breaksea Island, the Mercury Islands, Kapiti Island, and Tuhua Island are used here as case studies because they represent milestones for techniques used or results achieved. Successful methods used on islands range from bait stations and silos serviced on foot to aerial spread by helicopters using satellite navigation systems. The development of these methods has benefited from adaptive management. By applying lessons learned from previous operations the size, complexity, and cost effectiveness of the campaigns has gradually increased. The islands now permanently cleared of introduced rodents are being used for restoration of island-seabird systems and recovery of threatened species such as large flightless invertebrates, lizards, tuatara, forest birds, and some species of plants. The most ambitious campaigns have been on remote subantarctic Campbell Island (11300 ha) and warm temperate Raoul Island (2938 ha), aimed to provide long-term benefits for endemic plant and animal species including land and seabirds. Other islands that could benefit from rat removal are close inshore and within the natural dispersal range of rats and stoats (Mustela erminea). Priorities for future development therefore include more effective methods for detecting rodent invasions, especially ship rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus), broader community involvement in invasion prevention, and improved understanding of reinvasion risk management.

AB  - International policy development and expected climate change impacts such as flooding, landslides, and the extinction of sensitive species have forced countries around the Baltic Sea to begin working on national climate adaptation policies. Simultaneously, the EU is building both a central and a macro-regional Baltic Sea-wide adaptation strategy to support national policy developments. However, it yet remains unclear how these EU strategies will complement each other or national policies. This article analyzes the constraints and opportunities presented by this new institutional interplay and discusses the potential of the forthcoming EU strategies to support national policy. It does so by mapping how adaptation is institutionalized in two case countries, Sweden and Finland, and is organized in the two EU approaches. The vertical institutional interplay between scales is analyzed in terms of three factors: competence, capacity, and compatibility. Results indicate institutional constraints related to: risks of policy complexity for subnational actors, an unclear relationship between the two EU approaches, an overly general approach to targeting contextualized climate change vulnerabilities, and a general lack of strategies to steer adaptation. However, there are also opportunities linked to an anticipated increased commitment to the national management of adaptation, especially related to biodiversity issues.

AB  - This paper explores overlapping of economy and politics with ideology in 17th-century northern Sweden. Focusing on silver mining conducted in Sapmi (Lapland), the paper investigates the rhetoric of mines as arenas of moral and cultural improvement, the ways this rhetoric was expressed and aided by material culture and the ways the civilizing projects were contested by the indigenous Sami, towards whom many of these policies were directed. The analysis is set in a wider context of the 17th-century concept of political economy, state policies aiming at a better incorporation of Sapmi into the mainstream economy and culture of Sweden and informed by Foucauldian perspectives on governmentality and its spatial dimensions.

AB  - Balancing the positive and negative impacts of cruise tourism is a challenging task for port operators. Necessary information for cruise port planning and decision making may be laborious to acquire and further combine for holistic decision support. The current study applies a system-oriented sustainability scoring model to the port of Geiranger, Norway. The aim is to provide a practical and low-threshold approach for appraising sustainability aspects in cruise port planning and decision making. The scoring model provides an estimate of performance on sustainability indicators based on cruise call itinerary information and readily available ship data. Results demonstrate how using the scoring model can prove useful for both port management, planning, stakeholder communication and scenario evaluation.

AB  - This study explores a corporate campaign to pass a referendum to enable the development of a hydropower plant in a small Swedish community. In the changing institutional context that grounds this case, the organization needed to develop communicative practices that embodied "cultural competence," a set of processes identified as critical for the legitimacy and success of business organizations in the emerging global/intersectoral environment. Findings suggest that the MNC's communication strategy captured important components of cultural competence. However, institutional contradictions impeded enactment of the strategy and resulted in delegitimizing paradoxical communication. The results indicate that organizational awareness of institutional change and culturally competent strategy are insufficient without special attention to contradictions and resultant communicative paradoxes embodied within a particular institutional context. The importance of a reflective communication approach that engages contradictions and tensions in the surrounding micro-macro institutional contexts is underscored.

AB  - Negative consequences of intensive forest management on biodiversity are often mitigated by setting aside old forest, but alternative strategies have been suggested. We have compared using simulations the consequences of two of these alternatives setting aside young forests or extending rotation periods - to that of current practice in managed boreal forest In all scenarios we applied a constant conservation budget and predicted forest development and harvesting over 200 years. As a proxy for biodiversity conservation, we projected the extinction risk of a dead wood-dependent beetle, Diacanthous undulatus, in a 50 km(2) landscape in central Sweden, using a colonization-extinction model. During the first century, setting aside young forest stands rather than old stands increased extinction risk because young stands have lower habitat quality. However, habitat quality of young forests increased as they aged and they were much cheaper to set aside than old stands. Therefore, the strategy allowed a larger set-aside area (within the budget constraint), resulting in lower extinction risk and harvested timber volumes in the second century. Prolonging rotations also decreased the extinction risk but was in the long-term less cost-effective. The most cost-effective strategy in the long-term (200 years) was to set aside a mixture of old and young forest. However, setting aside young stands rather than prolonging rotations or setting aside old stands delays both the benefits (lower extinction risk) and costs (lost harvest volumes), so the optimal strategy depends on the assumed societal values and hence discount rates.

AB  - Surface soil (0-2 cm) quality in 87 day care centres in the city of Bergen, Norway has been studied. Approximately 45% of the day care centres contained Pb and PAH values above recommended action levels. There are clear variations between different areas of the city. The old central part of the city hosts most of the contaminated day care centres. In suburban areas most of the day care centres have Pb and PAH concentrations below action levels. City fires, gas work emission, lead-based paint, and traffic are probably important anthropogenic contamination sources. together with uncontrolled transportation of soil from contaminated to clean areas. Geological or other natural sources are probably not an important contributor to the high levels of lead and PAH. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinal variation is paramount for understanding the factors shaping genetic diversity in space and time. During the last glacial maximum, northern Europe was covered by glacial ice that rendered the region uninhabitable for most taxa. Different evolutionary processes during and after the recolonisation of this area from different glacial refugia have affected the genetic landscape of the present day European flora and fauna. In this study, we focus on the common toad (Bufo bufo) in Sweden and present evidence suggesting that these processes have resulted in two separate lineages of common toad, which colonised Sweden from two directions. Using ddRAD sequencing data for demographic modelling, structure analyses, and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), we provide evidence of a contact zone located between Uppland and Vasterbotten in central Sweden. Genetic diversity was significantly higher in southern Sweden compared to the north, in accordance with a pattern of decreased genetic diversity with increasing distance from glacial refugia. Candidate genes under putative selection are identified through outlier detection and gene-environment association methods. We provide evidence of divergent selection related to stress response and developmental processes in these candidate genes. The colonisation of Sweden by two separate lineages may have implications for how future conservation efforts should be directed by identifying management units and putative local adaptations.

KW  - AGRICULTURE
AB  - There are ever-growing demands on farmers to consider the wider environmental implications of production, not least in the Baltic Sea Region where concerns about agricultural-related eutrophication are significant. In Sweden, farmers are being nudged through voluntary agro-environmental measures, enticed by the market and compelled to make the transition from a productivist agriculture to a multifunctional one. Drawing on the 'good farmer' concept, inspired by Bourdieu, this article studies Swedish conventional and agro-environmental organic farmers' views and reflections on the changing relationship between farming practices and the environment. The article finds that despite 25 years of agro-environmental policy in Sweden, some conventional farmers are still mired in a narrow productivist mindset. That said, the study concludes that we should be wary of conceiving the 'good farmer' too strictly in productivist terms, given that the 'rules of the agricultural game' in Sweden are leading to a more divergent farmer habitus. Farmers are looking for opportunities within the multifunctional agricultural field, which increasingly demands and expects all farmers to embed social and environmental goals into production considerations.

AB  - Mobility as a service (MaaS), a new concept of transportation, is regarded as an effective solution to prevalent urban traffic problems because of its sustainable development properties such as sharing, integration, humanism and low-carbon. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow especially in China. In this paper, we propose a new alliance-based framework of development scenarios for the Chinese MaaS system. At the same time, by distinguishing the experience and lessons between the UbiGo project in Sweden and Whim project in Finland, we summarize that the key to the success of prior pilot projects is the cooperation of industry alliance, government policy support, and data sharing mechanism. Moreover, this paper also proposes some MaaS solutions for the obstacles of alliance-based cooperation, data resource sharing, business model selection, operation conditions, development path, policy support and other aspects in China.

AB  - The paper aims to add to the debate on the varieties of neoliberalism and the homogenizing effects of megaproject-based urban development. It examines the acculturation of the growth imperative as the master discourse that supports the development and implementation of two projects aimed at transforming the centers of Tampere, Finland, and Lodz, Poland. The selected cities shared similar traits as industrial centers in the past, but their current socioeconomic situation is entirely different. Tampere holds the title of "Finland's most likeable city," while rapidly depopulating Lodz was labeled the "Polish Detroit." Nevertheless, both municipalities became attracted by the idea of boosting their development through implementing large-scale infrastructural investments to reshape their centers. Inspired by discursive institutionalism, which defines discourse as a set of policy ideas and values, and interactive policy communication and formulation processes, the paper reconstructs and compares the strategic visions of Tampere's "Five Star City Centre" and "The New Centre of Lodz." It demonstrates how the proponents of the projects discursively forced consent around proposed ideas. Namely, it shows how the issues of complexity, risk, and potential conflict of the two megaprojects have been addressed. On a conceptual level, the paper shows how policy convergence can be discursively facilitated in different socioeconomic, cultural, and political circumstances.

AB  - This paper takes a critical heritage approach to understanding the ways that the conservation of Nordic Mountain cows gets animated as a form of Nordic heritage. Today, Nordic Mountain cows are found in the Northern regions of Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Based on an archive of mediated material (websites, YouTube videos, and social media activism), policy documents as well as interviews with Nordic farm animal genetic resources directors, the paper analyzes how conservation becomes imagined. Viewing the conservation of Nordic Mountain cows as entangled with imaginaries of traditional ways of life, a Northern Nordic (endangered) landscape, and the potential for high quality, ethically sound Nordic heritage products; conservation gets imagined as a rescue technology preserving 'native' and 'endangered' breeds in the making of sustainable consumer goods and Nordic cultural heritage. The conservation of Nordic Mountain cows goes beyond the potentially endangered species, however, to the reiteration of Nordic exceptionalism and the promise of a pure (and white) Nordic biocultural refuge of human-nonhuman animal relations.

AB  - Air quality management is strongly driven by legislative aspects related to the exceedance of air quality limit values. Here, we use the Norwegian Climate Centre's Earth System Model to assess the impact of a future scenario of maximum feasible aerosol emission abatement and increasing greenhouse gases (RCP4.5) on urban PM2.5 concentrations in Europe. Daily PM2.5 concentrations are assessed using a novel downscaling method which allows us to compute exceedances of current and planned air quality thresholds. For the latter, we assume that future ambitious emission reductions are likely to be accompanied by stricter air quality thresholds. The changes in PM2.5 concentrations are discussed in the context of the large-scale atmospheric changes observed relative to the present-day climate.Our results show a more positive North Atlantic Oscillation mean state in the future, combined with a large eastward shift of both North Atlantic sea-level pressure centres of action. This is associated with more frequent mid-latitude blocking and a northward shift of the jet stream. These changes favour higher than expected anthropogenic urban PM2.5 concentrations in Southern Europe, while they have the opposite effect on the northern half of the continent. In the future scenario, PM concentrations in substantial parts of Southern Europe are found to exceed the World Health Organisation Air Quality Guideline daily limit of 25g/m(3) on 25 to over 50days per year, and annual guidelines of 10 mu g/m(3) on more than 80% of the 30years analysed in our study. We conclude that alterations in atmospheric circulation in the future, induced by stringent maximum feasible air pollution mitigation as well as GHG emissions, will negatively influence the effectiveness of these emission abatements over large parts of Europe. This has important implications for future air quality policies.

AB  - 1. Like many butterflies, the woodland brown Lopinga achine has disappeared from many locations in western Europe due to habitat loss. The population dynamics and the effects of tree and bush cover on population size were studied experimentally south of Linkoping, Sweden.
   2. Most populations in the study area were small (< 500 individuals) and fluctuated synchronously between years. Long-term population dynamics and occurrence were closely correlated with tree and bush cover. Populations occurred only at sites with <greater than or equal to> 60% canopy cover, but population density decreased sharply where cover exceeded 90%. Survival from egg to adult was highest at the edges of glades (2.3 adults per female) and lowest in the deepest shade (0.7 adults) or open sun (0.6 adults). The annual rate of canopy closure at unmanaged sites decreased linearly with tree and bush cover, approximately 1% closure at 60% cover and 0.3% at 85% cover, making it possible to predict the impact of habitat changes for L achine.
   3. In 1992-95, vegetation was cleared experimentally to create new glade edges at six unmanaged sites where the risk of extinction was high because few glades remained. On average, population size at five of the managed sites increased by > 90%. The population at the sixth site, managed in 1995, decreased by 30%.
   4. Cover of the host-plant Carex montana increased significantly at edges of new glades and decreased in closed unaffected woods. Successful restoration probably requires the presence of C. montana along edges of new glades from the onset of management because this plant was slow to colonize plots where it was initially absent.
   5. Currently, 86% of the sites in southern Sweden occupied by L. achine are unmanaged. If this situation continues, the metapopulation in this study will probably collapse within 20-40 years. Recovery programmes for L. achine should emphasize metapopulation dynamics, host-plant cover and vegetation dynamics over time. As with many butterflies, successful conservation requires a blend of detailed autoecology and active site management to produce the required successional conditions.

AB  - Human and industrial activities in Arctic areas are increasing, as are global water temperatures. Combined, these factors can result in altered conditions for species living in these, until recently, pristine areas. Of the anadromous salmonids, Arctic charr may be particularly vulnerable to these changes, as this species is adapted to cold waters and exploits restricted areas at sea. In order to test to what extent Arctic charr utilized coastal areas with anthropogenic interference versus more pristine waters, the marine area use of a population in northern Norway was documented over three consecutive years by use of acoustic telemetry. Their depth utilization, temperature preference and survival was also recorded. The tagged fish spent a minimum of half of their marine residency time within 5 km of the river outlet proximate to urbanized coastal areas. The fish also resided within a narrow temperature and depth range and spent a very limited period at sea. The marine habitat available to Arctic charr should be carefully considered in coastal development and management plans, as human activities and coastal water temperatures increase in the Arctic regions. The current study illustrates the importance of species and population-specific knowledge during development of management strategies for anadromous salmonids.

AB  - Explanations for causes of farmland biodiversity declines often assume no spatial or temporal variation in the effects of land use on species abundance and performance. For example, European populations of skylark are assumed to have declined partly due to the switch from spring sown to autumn sown crops. Still, land use preferences of farmland birds may vary with region, landscape structure and time in the breeding season. We inventoried 430 transects in 36 landscape plots (each 25 km(2)) in three major agricultural regions of southern Sweden and show that land use-specific densities of skylarks display strong temporal and regional differences. Pre-nesting densities in late April-early May were highest in autumn sown cereals and other arable land use with vegetation, but decreased during the course of the breeding season such that densities in spring sown cereals were slightly higher than those in autumn sown cereals late in the season. This temporal shift in crop-specific densities of skylarks differed between regions. Temporal patterns of crop-specific densities of skylarks could be explained in terms of vegetation-dependent nest predation risk and foraging conditions. We suggest that land use preferences of farmland birds often could be expected to display a temporal and spatial variation and this should be reflected in a more flexible, context-dependent approach for the conservation of farmland biodiversity.

AB  - We analyze what motivates Norwegian nonindustrial private forest owners to participate in a national voluntary conservation program. Our empirical study provides new insights, since the program requires participants to relinquish all rights to forestry for eternity, including future generations. To achieve an efficient conservation strategy, it is important to understand what drives motivations sufficiently strong to participate on such terms. Our econometric analyses suggest that forest owners' expectation of sustainable nontimber income enhanced by the program, positive attitude toward stricter conservation regulations, and lower share of mature forest have strong positive effects on the likelihood of participation.

AB  - 1. Stream liming can alleviate the effects of anthropogenic acidification but itself constitutes a substantial ecosystem-level perturbation. Acidity in the humic streams of northern Sweden largely arises from natural causes but liming is extensively practised, with uncertain ecological outcomes.
   2. We investigated macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and leaf-litter decomposition in seven humic Swedish streams, each of which is limed at a single point using a dosing tower. Grey alder Alnus incana leaves were enclosed in replicate fine (mesh size 0.5 mm) and coarse (10 mm) mesh bags at three locations in each stream: upstream of the dosing tower, in the transitional 'mixing zone' immediately downstream of the tower, and at a site further downstream where the lime powder is completely dissolved, with marked changes to water chemistry. Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were characterized from each site via five replicate Surber samples.
   3. Alkalinity, pH, conductivity and calcium (Ca) concentrations increased following liming, whereas dissolved organic carbon and aluminium concentrations decreased.
   4. Decomposition in fine mesh bags, primarily mediated by microbes, was positively associated with pH and Ca and was significantly elevated by liming, probably attributable to stimulation of fungal pectin-degrading enzymes that require Ca as a cofactor.
   5. Decomposition attributable to detritivorous insects (shredders), assessed by subtracting decomposition observed in fine mesh bags from that observed in coarse bags, was reduced following liming, in concert with changes to shredder assemblages. Abundance of large caddisfly shredders declined in limed stream sections, whereas some smaller stoneflies increased in number. Shredder diversity declined following liming during spring. Species evenness fell overall, and richness was reduced in four of six streams.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Water chemistry changes following stream liming in northern Sweden appear to overcompensate for the limited acid deposition observed in the region, with important ecosystem consequences. The potential deleterious impacts of liming need to be balanced against its desired outcomes in regions where acidity is largely attributable to natural causes.

AB  - From November 12th to 13th in 1872, an extreme coastal flood event occurred in the south Baltic Sea. An unusual combination of winds created a storm surge reaching up to 3.5 m above mean sea level, which is more than a meter higher than all other observations over the past 200 years. On the Danish, German, and Swedish coasts, about 300 people lost their lives. The consequences of the storm in Denmark and Germany were more severe than in Sweden, with significantly larger destruction and higher numbers of casualties. In Denmark and Germany, the 1872 storm has been more extensively documented and remembered and still influences local and regional risk awareness. A comparative study indicates that the collective memory of the 1872 storm is related to the background knowledge about floods, the damage extent, and the response to the storm. Flood marks and dikes help to remember the events. In general, coastal flood defence is to the largest degree implemented in the affected areas in Germany, followed by Denmark, and is almost absent in Sweden, corresponding to the extent of the collective memory of the 1872 storm. Within the affected countries, there is local variability of flood risk awareness associated with the collective memory of the storm. Also, the economic dependency on flood-prone areas and conflicting interests with the tourism industry have influence on flood protection decisions. The processes of climate change adaptation and implementation of the EU Floods Directive are slowly removing these differences in flood risk management approaches.

AB  - Internationally marine ecosystem-based management has been embraced as an approach to design holistic marine management regimes. In this article a comparative research strategy is applied in the analysis of the holistic marine management regimes in Norway, Australia, US, Canada and the European Union. How can holistic marine management regimes based on an ecosystem approach contribute to sustainable ocean development? Important in this context is how the origin and theory of an ecosystem based management is implemented and interpreted, and to what extent this is manifested through policies, strategies and legal frameworks. The results of this research indicate that the implementation of marine-ecosystem based management is heterogeneous. This article discusses the concrete Mechanisms that are used to reach the aim of sustainable ocean management. Implementation challenges are related to lack of functional metrics, weak spatial measures, weak integration and lack of adaptive management. Still marine ecosystem-based management is an important step forward for sustainable ocean governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Protected areas are valuable tools for nature conservation but the effectiveness of reserve networks must be monitored continuously. Knowing the history of the establishment of protected areas can help to improve future conservation. We explore how different ecoregions, ecosystems and diversity hotspots have been incorporated in protected areas in Estonia during the last century. We found that the average rate of establishment of protected areas has been surprisingly constant despite profound changes in political systems. However, establishment of protected areas has varied regionally; an agricultural region in south-east Estonia has seen less protection, partly due to lower biodiversity. Wetland ecosystems were initially more placed under protection, whereas recently semi-natural grasslands have gained more attention. In contrast, farmland is under-protected. Surprisingly, biodiversity hotspots were no more protected than the national average. We consider how the development of a protected area network has been influenced by individual persons and public opinion under successive political systems. We suggest that simultaneous gap analysis of ecoregions, ecosystems and diversity hotspots provides a more complete picture than examining a single aspect. Therefore this study can be used as a model for other regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated a search for reservoirs and species potentially involved in back and forth transmission. Studies have postulated bats as one of the key reservoirs of coronaviruses (CoVs), and different CoVs have been detected in bats. So far, CoVs have not been found in bats in Sweden and we therefore tested whether they carry CoVs. In summer 2020, we sampled a total of 77 adult bats comprising 74 Myotis daubentonii, 2 Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and 1 M. mystacinus bats in southern Sweden. Blood, saliva and feces were sampled, processed and subjected to a virus next-generation sequencing target enrichment protocol. An Alphacoronavirus was detected and sequenced from feces of a M. daubentonii adult female bat. Phylogenetic analysis of the almost complete virus genome revealed a close relationship with Finnish and Danish strains. This was the first finding of a CoV in bats in Sweden, and bats may play a role in the transmission cycle of CoVs in Sweden. Focused and targeted surveillance of CoVs in bats is warranted, with consideration of potential conflicts between public health and nature conservation required as many bat species in Europe are threatened and protected.

AB  - Deadwood is widely recognized to be an important issue for biodiversity conservation in forest ecosystems. Establishing guidelines for its management requires a better understanding of relationships between woody debris characteristics and associated species assemblages. Although deadwood diameter has been identified as an important factor predicting occurrence of many saproxylic species, the boundary between small and large diameter has not yet been precisely defined. In commercial forests, it is also of critical importance to know which diameter is large enough to host the beetle species associated with large logs in order to ensure cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation measures. We investigated the differences in saproxylic beetle assemblages among four different diameter classes of downed woody oak and maritime pine debris, in France. Beetles were sampled using in situ emergence traps. The diameter of deadwood pieces ranged from 1 to 40 cm. No patterns of nestedness associated with the gradient of diameter size were identified for either tree species. More indicator saproxylic species were observed in large logs and branches than in small logs. A clear distinction appeared in assemblage composition around the 5-cm diameter threshold whereas no similar pattern occurred around the 10 cm value, i.e. the classical threshold used in forestry to distinguish fine woody debris from coarse woody debris. For both tree species, the mean body length of beetles increased with the diameter of deadwood suggesting that the quantity of available resources per piece may constitute a limiting factor for large beetle species. This study confirms that not only large deadwood pieces are relevant for saproxylic biodiversity conservation but also the smallest pieces. Therefore, forest managers would be well advised to maintain a high diversity of deadwoods to maintain saproxylic biodiversity.

AB  - Use of renewable energy sources is one solution to decrease green house gas emissions and the use of polluting fossil fuels. Renewables differ in their environmental and societal impacts, and to design sound renewable energy policy, societies need to assess the trade-offs between alternative sources. To enable the evaluation and comparison of renewable energy production alternatives in Finland, this paper applies the choice experiment to elicit the monetary information on people's preferences for four renewable energy sources: wind power, hydro power and energy from crops and wood, and considers four impacts of energy production: effects on biodiversity, local jobs, carbon emissions and household's electricity bill. The nested logit analysis reveals that higher income, male gender, young age, and pro-environmental attitude increase the probability to choose renewable energy instead of the current energy mix. Wind power is, on average, the most popular renewable energy technology, but regional differences exist. Biodiversity deterioration should be avoided. The national aggregate willingness to pay, based on stated preferences rather than preferences revealed by actual market behavior, for a combination of renewable energy technologies that corresponds to Finland's climate change and energy policy is over 500 million Euros.

AB  - The Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus is a bird inhabiting old-growth coniferous taiga Forests. It has recently declined in numbers in Finland mainly because of habitat fragmentation. Distant mtDNA lineages from Taimyrian Peninsula (subspecies P. i. monjerensis) and middle Yenisei valley (P. i. rogosovi) have diverged From Fennoscandian (P. i. infaustus) lineage ca 610000 yr ago. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor for Fennoscandian population (78000 yr) coincides with the beginning of the Weichselian ice age. Within Fennoscandia, the observed distribution of pairwise genetic distances followed the expected distribution of an expanding population reflecting the postglacial history rather than the present day situation of the Siberian jay, Mitochondrial control region sequences showed that among 65 Fennoscandian individuals the most common haplotype (40%) was Found in all but two populations. Genetic structuring (phi (ST) = 0.111) was clear within the Fennoscandian population. This may be attributable to low intrinsic natal dispersal. In an isolate of western Finland, nucleotide diversity was significantly lower than in P. i. infaustus populations of the continuous distribution area. We suggest that isolation by habitat fragmentation in modern landscapes may effectively reduce gene flow below the level occurring in natural conditions. Thus, Siberian jay isolates with limited number of individuals would be highly vulnerable to loss of genetic variation or even to extinction by demographic or environmental stochasticity.

AB  - The decisions on risk management (RM) of contaminated sites in Finland have typically been driven by practical factors such as time and money. However, RM is a multifaceted task that generally involves several additional determinants. e.g. performance and environmental effects of remediation methods, psychological and social factors. Therefore, we adopted a multi-criteria decision analysis approach and developed a decision support tool (DST) that is viable in decision-making in such a complex situation. The basic components of the DST are based on the Dutch REC system. However, our DST is more case-specific and allows the consideration of the type, magnitude and scale of contamination, land use, environmental conditions and socio-cultural aspects (e.g. loss of cultural heritage, image aspects). The construction of the DST was started by structuring the decision problem using a value tree. Based on this work we adopted the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) for data aggregation. The final DST was demonstrated by two model sites for which the RM alternatives and site-specific data were created on the basis of factual remediation projects and by interviewing experts. The demonstration of the DST was carried out in a workshop where representatives of different stakeholders were requested to rank and weight the decision criteria involved. To get information on the consistency of the ranking of the RM alternatives, we used different weighting techniques (ratio estimation and pair-wise weighting) and alternative ways to treat individual respondents' weights in calculating the preference scores for each RM alternative. These dissimilar approaches resulted in some differences in the preference order of the RM alternatives. The demonstration showed that attention has to be paid to the proper description of the site, the principles of the procedure and the decision criteria. Nevertheless, the procedure proved to enable efficient communication between different stakeholders and the identification of the preferred RM option. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multi-functionality and the provision of eco-system services are politically highly prioritised aspects of farming. This study uses a Symmetric Generalised McFadden cost function to analyze the relationship between costs of production and the provision of biodiversity for Swedish milk farms. Biodiversity indicators are based on the number of valuable plant species present at the farm and are modeled as an output in the cost function. The results show that the marginal cost of biodiversity increases with higher provision, and that an increased provision of biodiversity also increases the costs of market commodities such as milk and beef. The upward slope of the marginal cost of biodiversity and its competitive relationship with market goods questions the efficiency of support schemes based on voluntary programmes with a flat-rate per hectare compensation. Instead, the results support targeted environmental policy schemes with zonings and/or the use of biodiversity indicators.

AB  - Dewatered and non-dewatered sewage sludge from a secondary treatment plant was applied to plots planted with three Salix (willow) clones according to the Swedish short-rotation forestry concept. Stem biomass production was enhanced by the sludge application rate, which varied between 2.5 and 20 t DS/ha/yr. Sludge metals in general accumulated in the soil within the layer in which the sludge was applied, whereas metal transportation below this point was less pronounced. Concentrations of nutrients and metals in plant tissues were not influenced by the sludge application rates, but decreased in general with stem and stand age. Improved sewage sludge quality in recent years is contributing to the possibilities of designing sustainable systems for sludge use on productive land-for instance, in short-rotation forestry for biofuel production.

AB  - In the last decades, Romania faces massive woodcuts due to various political changes, agricultural crop expansion, urban development, cattle farming, mining for gas, minerals and oils and transportation.
   Deforestation has become a problem of national interest since the 20th century that threatens economic, social and natural balance. Researchers in this field highlights that forest alienation to foreigners is one of the main causes that led to the use of Romanian wood as a factor of economic growth for other states that currently hold 51% of the forest lands in our country. According to the data provided by Landmatrix, Austria, Sweden, Finland are the largest owners of forests, due to the extremely low price and permissive legislation.
   This paper aims to identify the main ways and possibilities to include Romanian NGOs in reforestation actions in order to restore biodiversity and restore the natural ecosystems balance. This desideratum is possible through the intense involvement of the state structures that manage the forest system based on the economic foundation of artificial reforestation projects in the less favored areas.

AB  - The Iisalmi Route watercourse in central-eastern Finland contains a number of highly eutrophic lakes. Despite substantial impacts from anthropogenic activity, the region appears to be naturally eutrophic because of its geological setting. A passive continental ice sheet deposited fine-grained basal till that contributes to the naturally eutrophic status of the lakes. Detailed paleolimnological studies in the Iisalmi Route are few. Therefore, we studied the eutrophication histories of three contrasting Iisalmi Route lakes: (1) small headwater Lake Saarisjarvi, (2) larger, but very shallow headwater Lake Nalantojarvi, and (3) large central basin, Lake Porovesi. We compared the suitability of three diatom-total phosphorus transfer functions for application to fossil samples. A local transfer function, specifically targeted to the Iisalmi Route, was the most suitable for the headwater lakes. In contrast, two regional transfer functions, which have larger geographical coverage, performed equally well for the large central basin. All three lakes proved to have been naturally eutrophic for thousands of years. Highest natural variability occurred in the longest core, from shallow headwater Lake Nalantojarvi. This variability reflects the dynamic development of the basin and its catchment after deglaciation. Diatom assemblage changes in cores from Lakes Saarisjarvi and Porovesi suggest cultural eutrophication, most likely after the region was colonized in the sixteenth century, followed by salinization in more recent times. Our study deepens understanding of naturally eutrophic boreal lakes that are located on fine-grained tills and their sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic forcing. Our results also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate transfer functions and realistic restoration targets when dealing with naturally eutrophic lakes.

AB  - Bumblebees are a key taxon contributing to the provision of crop pollination and ecosystem functioning. However, land use and climate change are two of the main factors causing bee decline across the world. In this study, we investigated how the flight period of bumblebee spring queens has shifted over the last century in Sweden, and to what extent such shifts depended on climate change, landscape context, latitude, and the phenology of bumblebee species. We studied ten species of bumblebees and used observations from museum specimens covering 117 years from the southernmost region in Sweden (Scania), combined with citizen-reported observations during the past 20 years across Sweden. We found that the flight period of bumblebees has advanced by 5 days on average during the last 20 years across Sweden. In the agriculture-dominated region of Scania, we found that in the late 2010s bumblebee spring queen activity in simplified landscapes had advanced by on average 14 days, compared to 100 years ago. In addition, in simplified landscapes the flight period of early species was significantly earlier compared to in complex landscapes. Our results provide knowledge on the intraspecific variation of phenological traits, indicating that early species (often common species) exhibit a higher plastic response to the environment, which may facilitate adaptation to both climate and landscape changes, compared to the late species of which many are declining.

AB  - Assessment of the potential impact of climate change on water systems has been an essential. part of hydrological research over the last couple of decades. However, the notion that such assessments should also include technological, demographic and land use changes is relatively recent. In this study, the potential impacts of climate change and continued urbanisation on waste and stormwater flows in the combined sewer of central Helsingborg, South Sweden, have been assessed using a series of DHI MOUSE simulations run with present conditions as well as two climate change scenarios and three progressive urbanisation storylines. At present, overflows of untreated wastewater following heavy rainfalls are a major source of pollution to the coastal receiving waters and there is a worry that increased rainfall could exacerbate the problem. Sewer flows resulting from different urbanisation storylines were simulated for two 10-year periods corresponding to present (1994-2003) and future climates (nominally 2081-2090). In all, 12 simulations were made. Climate change was simulated by altering a high-resolution rainfall record according to the climate-change signal derived from a regional climate model. Urbanisation was simulated by altering model parameters to reflect current trends in demographics and water management. It was found that city growth and projected increases in precipitation, both together and alone, are set to worsen the current drainage problems. Conversely, system renovation and installation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) has a positive effect on the urban environment in general and can largely allay the adverse impacts of both urbanisation and climate change.

AB  - Profound changes in land use occurred during the last century in Europe, driven by growing population, changes in affluence, and technological innovation. To capture and understand these changes, we compiled a consistent dataset on the distribution of land-use types and biomass extraction for nine European countries (Albania, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) since the late 19th to early 20th century, when national statistical publications became available. We then calculated a range of indicators within the "human appropriation of net primary production" (HANPP) framework for the nine countries and for the sum of all countries on a yearly basis from 1902 to 2003. We find that cropland and grazing land contracted in all countries except Albania in the observed period, while forestland increased. Crop yields increased in all countries, most strongly during the second half of the 20th century. In some countries, biomass extraction on grazing lands increased to a similar extent. Overall, HANPP was high but declined slightly from 63% of the net primary production of potential vegetation in 1902 to 55% in 2003. This is the result of increasing crop yields on shrinking cropland and grazing land, which was only partly offset by increasing biomass extraction on expanding forests and by expanding settlement areas. HANPP trends on croplands were mostly uniform across countries, but differed substantially on grazing lands. While political differences, e.g., between communist and capitalist countries, did not directly affect HANPP dynamics, economic and population growth were related to increases in biomass extraction for long periods of time in much of the sample, and only in recent decades did the collapse of the Eastern Block's Comecon market, EU agricultural policy, and world market developments coincide with a stagnation of biomass extraction.

AB  - Understanding causes of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) attacks on humans is critical to ensuring both human safety and polar bear conservation. Although considerable attention has been focused on understanding black (U. americanus) and grizzly (U. arctos) bear conflicts with humans, there have been few attempts to systematically collect, analyze, and interpret available information on human-polar bear conflicts across their range. To help fill this knowledge gap, a database was developed (Polar Bear-Human Information Management System [PBHIMS]) to facilitate the range-wide collection and analysis of human-polar bear conflict data. We populated the PBHIMS with data collected throughout the polar bear range, analyzed polar bear attacks on people, and found that reported attacks have been extremely rare. From 1870-2014, we documented 73 attacks by wild polar bears, distributed among the 5 polar bear Range States (Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and United States), which resulted in 20 human fatalities and 63 human injuries. We found that nutritionally stressed adult male polar bears were the most likely to pose threats to human safety. Attacks by adult females were rare, and most were attributed to defense of cubs. We judged that bears acted as a predator in most attacks, and that nearly all attacks involved <= 2 people. Increased concern for both human and bear safety is warranted in light of predictions of increased numbers of nutritionally stressed bears spending longer amounts of time on land near people because of the loss of their sea ice habitat. Improved conflict investigation is needed to collect accurate and relevant data and communicate accurate bear safety messages and mitigation strategies to the public. With better information, people can take proactive measures in polar bear habitat to ensure their safety and prevent conflicts with polar bears. This work represents an important first step towards improving our understanding of factors influencing human-polar bear conflicts. Continued collection and analysis of range-wide data on interactions and conflicts will help increase human safety and ensure the conservation of polar bears for future generations.

AB  - Soil is an important component for monitoring of sustainability of land use in relation to both the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity of ecosystems. Recently research has focused on the role of mites (Acari) in biomonitoring and their importance as soil bioindicators. Mite communities are extremely sensitive to all types of soil disturbance. This article presents a review of some studies on mite communities in order to discuss whether the diversity and numbers of mites present in the soil can reflect human impact on ecosystems and landscape, and whether mites can be used in monitoring systems. Limited data available about mite communities in agricultural ecosystems (in use and abandoned) in SW Norway from author's own studies (published and in prep.) are compared with data from ca. 55 papers (mostly concerning Europe). IT was concluded that: (1) Most oribatid mites with their long life span, low fecundity, slow development and low dispersion ability can be a robust indicator of the environment. Changes in the dominance structure of mite communities (Oribatida to Actinedida ratio) are suggested to be an 'early warnings criterion for stressed mite communities. (2) Both the number of species and the percentage abundance of Nothroidea and Ptyctimina decrease following human impact on the landscape. Even if individuals cannot be determined to species levels (e.g. Ptyctimina), the percent contribution and frequency of these taxa in relation to stress gradient (input levels) within the landscape provide valuable data. (3) Tectocepheus velatus (Michael 1880) and other oribatid taxa with a similar life-history strategy should be evaluated as potential bioindicators for impoverished ecosystems.

(5) Residual natural and semi-natural habitats (such as old woodlands, riparian ecosystems, old hedges and grasslands) with species-rich mite communities found in rural and urban landscapes should be preserved as refuges for dispersion of soil fauna.

AB  - A high capacity for long-distance dispersal is a key to success for species confronted with environmental heterogeneity, habitat modification, fragmentation and loss. However, dispersal capacity is difficult to quantify and therefore poorly known in most taxa. Here, we report on a test for an association of variation in dispersal capacity with variable colouration of noctuid moths. First, using data from 12 experienced lepidopterologists, we showed that despite variation among experts in average assessments, different species are consistently classified as having non-variable, variable or highly variable colour patterns when assessed by different experts. We then compared the incidence of non-resident species with high inter-individual variation in colour patterns recorded on the isolated island Utklippan (n = 47), with that in a species pool of potential long-distance dispersers from the nearest mainland (n = 295). Species with high inter-individual colour pattern variation were over-represented on the island compared with species having non-variable colouration. This finding constitutes rare evidence from the wild of long-distance dispersal, measured on a spatial scale relevant for moths when tracking habitats in fragmented and changing landscapes or when keeping pace with environmental challenges associated with climate change. Finally, we showed that Swedish noctuid moths classified as agricultural pests (n = 28) had more variable colour patterns compared with non-pests (n = 368). The majority of agricultural pests were also recorded on the isolated island, an outcome that is indicative of pest species having high dispersal capacity. Data on colour pattern variation may thus offer a simple and cost-effective proxy to estimate dispersal capacity and can also help identify potential pest species. Our findings are potentially useful when modelling and predicting population and range dynamics of species in spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments, with direct implications for conservation biology and pest management.

AB  - In the rapid urbanization and land development process, the integration of urban and rural areas has accelerated. Alongside this trend, the sustainable operation of suburban villages in metropolitan areas face many difficulties and challenges, especially in terms of the efficient use of land and the coordination of stakeholders' interests. However, there remains a lack of systematic case studies in the literature targeted toward suburban villages in metropolises. This study selects three typical suburban villages in the metropolis of Jiangning District, Nanjing (i.e., a metropolis in China) to narrow this research gap. We collected primary data based on field investigations, structural interviews, and professional documents. With three typical villages employed as comparative case studies, we developed a theoretical framework to systematically analyze the operation process and the challenges faced by suburban villages in the metropolis. The results revealed the different application scenarios of three stakeholderled models, including the state-owned enterprise-led model, the grassroots government-led model, and the private capital-led model, in the sustainable operation of metropolis-based suburban villages. The findings shed new light on selecting an appropriate path to boost the sustainable endogenous development of rural areas. This study extends existing research on the sustainable operation of suburban villages in the metropolis, providing practical guidance on aligning stakeholderled models to better integrate urban and rural areas.

AB  - Biodiversity studies and conservation management often neglect fundamental genetic diversity, even if biodiversity loss due to reduction in genetic diversity in declining, relatively common species is probably greater than the loss resulting from disappearing rare species. Climate models suggest that global warming will especially affect high latitudes due to a higher than average temperature increase towards the poles. In widespread Northern Hemisphere species, climate warming will therefore negatively affect especially northern and mountain genetic variants (NMGVs) in the same way that it will affect species with similar distributions. To explore whether NMGVs are frequent, they were searched for in ten widespread moss species based on a wide geographical sampling in Sweden and (two-) three (-four) molecular markers per species. NeighborNet split networks and jackknife analyses showed that eight of the studied species include one or more northern or, in most cases, mountain intraspecific genetic lineages or groups of related haplotypes. Analysis of molecular variance also showed that in the two species lacking such lineages or groups the genetic composition differs between different parts of Sweden or between lowlands and mountains of the north. Haplotype or nucleotide diversity is often higher in the north or mountains than in the south or lowlands. The high incidence of NMGVs, differences in genetic composition between the study regions and the frequent high diversity in the north or mountains show that conservation of the total biodiversity must also include the genetic diversity, not just the more obvious species-level taxa with restricted northern or mountain distributions.

AB  - 1 Deciduous trees within a coniferous forest landscape provide habitat for many organisms. Single trees in deciduous forests form dynamic patches that emerge, grow and fall, but the stands themselves are also dynamic patches established after disturbances and replaced by conifers during succession. Increased dispersal distance, as imposed by landscape fragmentation, may lead to extinctions and reduced biodiversity among species dependent on this dynamic network.
   2 We analysed regional frequency distributions, local abundances and spatial occupancy patterns of epiphytic bryophytes in 135 deciduous forest stands in a fragmented landscape in Sweden. We used generalized non-linear models to test whether these patterns could be assigned to metapopulation dynamics of individual epiphytes by investigating the relative importance of stand size, habitat quality, connectivity and landscape history on species occupancies and local abundances.
   3 Most asexually dispersed species were regionally rare, and spatial species occupancy patterns suggest that this is caused by dispersal limitation. In sexually dispersed species, a strong rescue effect was indicated by a bimodal frequency distribution of the species, as well as by increasing local abundance with increasing connectivity to stands present today, or some decades ago. There was a strong positive relationship between regional frequency and local abundance of the species, and between species richness and forest stand size. Vicinity to forest edge negatively affected the local abundance of most species.
   4 Our results clearly indicate a metapopulation structure. Sensitivity of epiphytes to habitat fragmentation is caused by decreasing forest sizes, habitat alteration at forest edges and increasing dispersal distances. Even in assumed good dispersers, increasing distances can significantly alter regional dispersal processes. A lower rescue effect leads to smaller stand population sizes with a larger extinction risk. Rapid reduction of the amount of habitat during the last decades and the expected time-lag in species extinctions suggest that epiphytes will further decline in the future, although there may still be time for restoration programmes to prevent extinction.

AB  - Hiorthhamn is an abandoned Norwegian coal mining settlement with a loading dock and a lot of industrial infrastructure left in the coastal zone. In this study, changes in the position of 1.3 km of the Hiorthhamn shoreline, which affect cultural heritage, is described for a time-period spanning 92 years (1927-2019). The shoreline positions were established based on a map (1927), orthophotos (2009) and a topographic survey with differential Global Positioning System (GPS) (summer 2019). Detailed geomorphological and surface sediment mapping was conducted to form a framework for understanding shoreline-landscape interaction. The shoreline was divided into three sectors to calculate the erosion/stability/accretion rates by using the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) extension of ArcGIS. The DSAS analysis showed very high erosion in Sector 1, while Sectors 2 and 3 showed moderate accretion and moderate erosion, respectively. Sector 1 is geologically composed of easily erodible sorted beach sediments and protected remains from the mining industry such as wrecks of heavy machines, loading carts, wagons and rusty tracks that are directly exposed to coastal erosion. The all-sector average shoreline erosion rate (EPR parameter) for the 92 years period was -0.21 m/year. The high shoreline erosion rates in Sector 1, together with the high potential damage to cultural heritage, supports the urgent need of continued coastal monitoring and sustainable management of cultural heritage in Hiorthhamn.

AB  - The optimal provision of agri-environmental externalities is studied in a model of endogenous input use and land allocation augmented by their effects on biodiversity, landscape diversity and nutrient runoffs. Whereas biodiversity and landscape diversity are public good aspects of agriculture, nutrient runoffs are negative externalities. We show that fertiliser use is higher and the size of buffer strips lower at the private optimum than at the social optimum. The socially optimal land allocation differs from the private solution as a result of the valuation of diversity benefits and runoff damages. The socially optimal policy under heterogeneous land quality involves a differentiated fertiliser tax and a differentiated buffer strip subsidy. We use Finnish data to characterise empirically the socially optimal design of policy instruments.

AB  - As a consequence of the recent change in human land-use intensity in mountain territories in the Italian Alps, many Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) subalpine forests have recently developed without significant anthropogenic disturbance. Even so, their structure and dynamics are still influenced by past human activity. In order to analyze the interactions between past management and current stand dynamics, competition among trees was studied in two 1-ha permanent plots in the Valbona Forest Reserve, located within the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park (eastern Italian Alps). The plots were established in 1993 in two stands with similar age, density and structure but different management history. Tree measurement was repeated in 2005.
   We carried out the analysis both on the stand- and on the individual tree scale. We computed maximum Stand Density Index (SDI) for Norway spruce in Paneveggio Park (SDImax 1380) based on an ancillary sample plot network. The intensity of stand-level competition and its course through time was assessed in each study area computing percent relative SDI (SDI%) for the two inventory years.
   Competition at individual level was studied using known individual-based competition indices (CIs) as well as a new set of Crown Area Indices (CAI), all of them based on tree variables such as dbh, height, crown area and inter-tree distance. We assessed the performance of each index by evaluating its explanatory power in forecasting individual tree basal area growth (Delta g) in a 10-year period.
   In the more recently thinned plot, competition did not induce mortality rates comparable to the second plot, that has been unmanaged for the last 60 years. We expect the intensity of competition-induced mortality of the two stands to increase its similarity in the next future.
   Individual CIs based solely on tree diameter produced the best performance in plot 1 (e.g., Daniels' CI, R-adj(2) = 0.580). In plot 2 different CIs, including tree height, crown area and inter-tree distance as base variables also, proved the most explanatory ones, including CAI(6) (R-adj(2) = 0.553), which not consider dbh.
   We attributed the differential role of tree spatial location and dominance-related descriptors in predicting growth to the time when the stand experienced the last anthropogenic disturbance. The competition relationships still experience the effect of the artificial alteration of forest structure: after human disturbance, mature Norway spruce subalpine forests need several decades to approach more natural dynamics.

AB  - Local authorities are important actors in sustainability transformations, but smaller municipalities generally do not have the same capacities as larger ones to work strategically with climate-related risks and long-term sustainability issues. Our study analyses the efforts of two Swedish local authorities to build capacity for transformative climate governance, paying attention to how structural factors and multi-level governance relations shape local capacity building. Drawing on interviews with municipal staff and the analysis of policy documents we show that both local authorities are increasingly applying experimental climate governance approaches. In Enkoping, innovative governance processes support sustainability objectives and promote public-private collaboration. In Kiruna, the necessity to move the town centre has advanced innovation capacity but steals attention from other issues. We conclude that vertical and horizontal multi-level governance relations facilitate capacity building, but in a national context where climate action is largely voluntary, more support is needed for smaller municipalities with limited resources to reach their climate goals.

AB  - The limited availability of resources for conservation has led to the development of many quantitative methods for selecting reserves that aim to maximize The biodiversity value of reserve networks, in published analyses, species are often considered equal, although some are in much greater need of protection than others. Furthermore, representation is usually treated as a threshold a species is either represented or not, but varying levels of representation over or under a given target level are not valued differently. We propose that a higher representation level should also have higher value. We introduce a framework for reserve selection that includes species weights and benefit functions for under- and overrepresentation (number of locations for each species). We applied the method to conservation planning for herb-rich forests in southern Finland. Our use of benefit functions and weighting changed the identity of about 50% of the selected sites at different funding levels and improved the representation of rare and threatened species. We also identified a small area of additional land that would substantially enhance the existing reserve network. We suggest that benefit functions and species weighting should be considered as standard options in reserve-selection applications.

AB  - The great number of actors in port city regions, such as port authorities, municipalities, national governments, private companies, societal groups, and flora and fauna, need to develop shared visions. Collaborative approaches that focus on combined values can help achieve long-term resilience and enable a sustainable and just coexistence of port and city actors within the same territory. However, the sheer focus on economic profit generated by port activities overshadows and ignores equally essential cultural, societal, and environmental values and needs. The lack of pluralities in planning and decision-making processes creates challenges for the cohabitation of the many actors and their interests within port-city regions. On the one hand, contemporary spaces in port cities cannot be classified and defined by traditional dichotomies anymore. On the other hand, the perception of spatial and institutional boundaries between port and city leads to a positivistic-driven definition of a rigid and inflexible, line-like interface physically and mentally separating the port from the urban activities and stakeholders, neglecting the inseparable character of many parts of our society. By investigating and re-imagining the future port-development plans within the historic mining town of Kirkenes, located around 400km above the Arctic Circle in Northern Norway, the aim of this article is to explore and combine the concepts of negative and positive porosity and liminality and arrive at a renewed perception of the port cityscape, which can function as dynamic thresholds inbetween the multiple dualities and realities of various port and city actors. The article bridges the theoretical/conceptual sphere of urban porosity and the practical approaches of liminal design. By using Design Fiction as a tool for creating new, innovative, and pluralistic port city narratives, the article contributes to contemporary research that aims for imaginary, value-based, and history-informed approaches to designing future-proof, resilient, just, and sustainable port cities.

AB  - Deadwood is an essential element of forest ecosystems that is a source of nutrients and serves a very important role in the maintenance of biodiversity. Our study aimed to determine the decomposition rate of various species of deadwood while considering habitat conditions, especially moisture content. The study was carried out in the Czarna R ' ozga Reserve in central Poland. Research plots were designated in a habitat moisture gradient (fresh, wet, and boggy). Eleven wood species were included in the study in two forms (40-mm-long/40-mm-diameter cylinders and 50x50x22 mm cubes). Wood samples were placed directly on the soil surface. After 40 months, these were removed for laboratory analysis. A significant impact of habitat moisture on the decomposition processes of wood samples was observed. The greatest loss of mass (50%, on average) was recorded under fresh habitat conditions. A higher moisture content slowed down the wood decomposition process. In the boggy habitat, the weight loss was 34%, on average. Our research confirmed that fine woody debris may constitute a useful source of nutrients in forest ecosystems that can be released over a short period of time.

AB  - Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) literature has traditionally focused on the countries and regions hit hardest by natural hazards. In this paper, we take a different perspective by turning our eyes upon Finland, a Nordic welfare state and a low vulnerability and exposure society. We analyse and discuss how well the existing DRR and CCA approaches reflect the perspective of the least vulnerable countries and whether the current ways of determining vulnerability and exposure neglect some risks or hinder the seizing opportunities brought by climate change.
   This paper is based on data gathered in a survey, interviews and workshops in two research projects which analysed weather and climate related risks in Finland. We conclude that disaster risk assessments need to be contingent and account for social and economic contexts. In an institutionally well-functioning welfare society, vulnerability assessments should emphasize relative changes in perceived social trends and social cohesion. Exposure should not be limited to direct geographical or physical exposure to local natural hazards. Successful opportunity identification can help improve DRR at home and abroad. In general, the role of political systems and culture as enabling factors for DRR and CCA need further study.

AB  - Agricultural activities and associated land use change are a major contributor to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making climate change mitigation in the agricultural sector all the more critical. However, farmers' willingness to adopt GHG abatement depends, to a large extent, on the financial implications of new practices. Climate change mitigation is unlikely to be adopted without external (financial, socio-cultural, or other) incentives. The research presented in this paper considers farmers' preferences for financing climate change mitigation practices through public crowdfunding. As a first study of its kind, we investigate farmers' attitudes towards climate change mitigation, knowledge of crowdfunding as a fundraising method, and interest in using public crowdfunding campaigns to finance on-farm mitigation practices. Based on a choice experiment survey with 443 Norwegian farmers, we show that knowledge about crowdfunding as an alternative finance method is generally low. Respondents who are interested in using crowdfunding prefer donation- or reward-based crowdfunding models that cover the full cost of mitigation over a loan-based model or campaigns that only fund a proportion of the costs. A financially secure farming business, previous exposure to crowdfunding, and a strong sense of responsibility to abate climate change are associated with higher farmers' interest in using crowdfunding. We find that farmers in Norway are hesitant to be publicly presented as recipients of crowdfunding, which suggests that crowdfunding is best set up as joint campaigns (e.g. with other farmers) that are run by intermediary organisations (rather than by individual farmers). Our findings highlight that, while opportunities to use crowdfunding as a fundraising method for agricultural climate change may be limited, properly designed campaigns can provide an effective instrument to engage certain groups of farmers in on-farm climate change mitigation.

AB  - This paper focuses on the intersection between degrowth and urban planning and contributes to a deeper understanding and a sharper concretisation of how a strong sustainability concept such as degrowth can be taken into planning practice. Taking the Swedish municipality of Sodertalje as a case, this paper uses empirical material from interviews with municipal urban planners and urban planning policy. The findings put current planning in relation to degrowth ideas, gather insights about the possible role of planning actors in a degrowth transition, and includes proposals for how planning practice can facilitate a degrowth future. This study finds that integrating a degrowth approach in planning practice means that urban planning needs to be subordinated to overarching social and environmental goals. Producing urban planning that is measured and conditioned by overarching goals would most likely imply completely different ways of planning, and goal-oriented backcasting scenarios are suggested as a tool to overcome this challenge. This paper also gathers strategies, like Sodertalje's Cultivation Strategy, that can facilitate a degrowth transition within current planning practice.

AB  - Global meat production and consumption are increasingly unsustainable. One way to counteract this development is to change the type of meat consumed. Rabbit meat has relatively lower climate impact than many other types of meat, but consumer acceptance is crucial for a socially sustainable production. In this study we examine the acceptance of industrial, extensive and urban rabbit production among Swedish senior high school youth, 17 to 19 yr old. An electronic survey was sent to ten randomly selected senior high school classes with 17 to 19 year-old students. The survey included inquiries about background, scaled responses and open-end questions with the opportunity to comment. A total of 111 students completed the survey, of which 62 were women, 74 from rural areas and 91 with previous animal experience. Extensive production was more accepted than industrial and urban production, while no difference was observed between industrial and urban production. Thus, the results advocate a farming system with more animal movement, less productivity and higher space requirements. In general, male respondents were more accepting of all production systems than women, while no difference could be detected between rural and urban citizens. The scaling shows that animal welfare, local production and meat quality was given priority over climate impact, biodiversity and price. Our study suggests useful prerequisites to consider for the meat industry in general, and for the development of Swedish rabbit production.

AB  - Electric vehicles seem to offer a great potential for sustainable transport development. The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. It is the following combination of objectives that puts demand on a new process model adapted for cross-sector and cross-disciplinary cooperation: (i) a fossil-free transport system in Sweden by 2030 and, to avoid sub-optimizations in the transport sector, (ii) assuring that solutions that support (i) also serve other aspects of sustainability in the transport sector and, to avoid that sustainable solutions in the transport sector block sustainable solutions in other sectors, (iii) assuring cohesive creativity across sectors and groups of experts and stakeholders. The new process model was applied in an action-research mode for the exploration of electric vehicles within a fully sustainable transport system to test the functionality of the model in support of its development. To deliver on the above combination of objectives, a framework was needed with principles for sustainability that are universal for any sector as boundary conditions for redesign, and with guidelines for how any organization or sector can create economically feasible stepby-step transition plans. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) is designed to serve such purposes and therefore is embedded into the new process model. The exploration of this new model also helped to identify four interdependent planning perspectives ('Resource base', 'Spatial', 'Technical' and 'Governance') that should be represented by the respective experts and stakeholders using the model. In general, the new process model proved helpful by giving diverse stakeholders with various competences and representing various planning perspectives a common, robust, and easy-to understand goal and a way of working that was adequate for each of their contexts. Furthermore, the evolving process model likely is relevant and useful not only for transport planning and electric vehicles, but for any other societal sector as well and thus for sustainable community planning in general.

AB  - European cultural landscapes have been Subject to change since the middle of the twentieth century, and among the most significant alterations are general re-growth, reforestation, and overgrowth. Such changes might lead to landscape loss for locals and deterioration of vistas for sightseeing holiday makers. This article responds to a lack of academic research on landscape perceptions among tourists. The main objective is to explore international tourists' landscape perceptions in a coastal area in northern Scandinavia, focusing on three different concepts thought to be important for tourists' landscape preferences: typicality, vegetation lushness, and degree of human influence. A combination of free and directed sorting procedures was employed. Quantitative and categorical data derived from the multiple sorting methods were subjected to multidimensional scaling analysis. The results indicate that foreign tourists might have an understanding of re-growth in the case area. Preference ratings gave mixed results in relation to vegetation and human influence as important features for landscape preferences, as found in previous studies. The findings emphasise the need for taking into consideration typicality of setting in future landscape research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Choices made around using language in museums can either reinforce or challenge existing common sense language regimes and cultural hegemonies. The issues around linguistic choices are particularly pronounced for a museum of indigenous culture in a multilingual minority language community. Using the case of the Siida, the National Museum of the Finnish Sami, located in Inari, in Finnish Samiland, we explore some of the issues involved in using language in the museum. Based on a linguistic landscape analysis, we identify three main functions of language in the museum: managing and controlling visitors; narrating and explaining content and being displayed as content/exhibit. We discuss these functions in the context of the Siida Museum and also explore the associated challenges and opportunities. Our analysis shows how the language choices made by museums in relation to all three functions can present an opportunity to challenge existing language hegemonies and inequalities.

AB  - This study compared visitor preferences of forestry professionals across six European countries (Sweden, Denmark, Great Britain, Austria, Romania and Portugal) using a questionnaire survey. The 598 interviewees were asked to rank photographs depicting recently thinned experimental plots in a 13-year old stand of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) according to the criterion: "Which forest environment do you prefer as a visitor?" The plots represented five different residual stem densities: 7000 (no thinning, very high stem density), 5300 (heavy thinning, high stem density), 1000 (very heavy thinning, medium stem density), 300 (extremely heavy thinning, low stem density/open stand) and 100 (solitary trees, very low stem density/very open stand) stems ha(-1). The results indicated geographical variation in the preferences for different thinning practices in young stands of oak. Portuguese, Austrian and Romanian respondents generally favoured thinned, but dense stands, whereas Danish and British respondents preferred very heavily thinned stands. Swedish respondents preferred open stands resulting from extremely heavy thinning. Photographs taken along rows were favoured to photographs across rows, indicating a preference for scenes offering perspective and accessibility. The results indicate a variation of visitor preferences among forestry professionals for different silvicultural regimes. We interpret this in the context of national traditions and forestry paradigms that influence the shaping of preferences.

AB  - Interest in liquid biofuels production and use has increased worldwide as part of government policies to address the growing scarcity and riskiness of petroleum use, and, at least in theory, to help mitigate adverse global climate change. The existing biofuels markets are dominated by U.S. ethanol production based on cornstarch, Brazilian ethanol production based on sugarcane, and European biodiesel production based on rapeseed oil. Other promising efforts have included programs to shift toward the production and use of biofuels based on residues and waste materials from the agricultural and forestry sectors, and perennial grasses, such as switchgrass and miscanthus-so-called cellulosic ethanol. This article reviews these efforts and the recent literature in the context of ecological economics and sustainability science. Several common dimensions for sustainable biofuels are discussed: scale (resource assessment, land availability, and land use practices); efficiency (economic and energy); equity (geographic distribution of resources and the "food versus fuel" debate); socio-economic issues; and environmental effects and emissions. Recent proposals have been made for the development of sustainable biofuels criteria, culminating in standards released in Sweden in 2008 and a draft report from the international Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. These criteria hold promise for accelerating a shift away from unsustainable biofuels based on grain, such as corn, and toward possible sustainable feedstock and production practices that may be able to meet a variety of social, economic, and environmental sustainability criteria.

AB  - Consequences for net present value, net income and hat-vest related to 'sustainable forest management regimes' at non-industrial forest owner level in Norway are discussed. The following indicators of a sustainable forest management have been analysed: existing old forest set aside for preservation, maintaining minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, restricted treatments for border zone areas around water bodies, retention of trees at final harvest and restricted options with respect to regeneration. The consequences were analysed according to individual as well as co-operative management for eight different properties. GAYA-JLP, a large scale forestry scenario model applying simulations and linear programming, was used for the calculations. A regime with a 'medium' intensity of the environmentally oriented constraints, and a real rate of discount of 2.5%, reduced the net present values by 8% to 20%. The results indicated that the consequences for individual properties might vary considerably if the regimes for a sustainable forestry are designed generally without considering the heterogeneity among the properties with respect to the initial forest state. Assuming co-operative management, the net present value of the entire forest area (all properties) increased. At the same time it was possible to increase, respectively, the proportion of old forest set aside for preservation and the area covered by old forest through time. The differences compared with individual management were relatively small for all these parameters, and most likely not large enough to cover up for the transaction costs related to co-operative management. Whether the gains of co-operation will exceed transaction costs, can probably only be answered through cost-benefit analyses of the actual project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In forests worldwide, similar to 10-40% of bird and mammal species require cavities for nesting or roosting. Although knowledge of tree cavity availability and dynamics has increased during past decades, there is a striking lack of studies from boreal Europe. We studied the density and characteristics of cavities and cavity-bearing trees in three categories of forest in a north-Swedish landscape: clearcuts with tree retention, managed old (>100 years) forest, and unmanaged old forest. Unmanaged old forests had significantly higher mean density of cavities (2.4 +/- 2.2(SD) ha(-1)) than managed old forest (1.1 +/- 2.1 ha(-1)). On clearcuts the mean cavity density was 0.4 +/- 2.3 ha(-1). Eurasian aspen (Populus tremula) had a higher probability of containing excavated cavities than other tree species. There was a greater variety of entrance hole shapes and a higher proportion of cavities with larger entrances in old forest than on clearcuts. Although studies of breeding success will be necessary to more accurately assess the impact of forest management on cavity-nesting birds, our results show reduced cavity densities in managed forest. To ensure future provision of cavities, managers should retain existing cavity-bearing trees as well as trees suitable for cavity formation, particularly aspen and dead trees.

AB  - 1. Spatial prioritization, based on the biogeographical identification of priority areas for conservation actions, is an important aspect of conservation planning. Although the influence of factors such as costs, threats or use of surrogates on the resulting priorities has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about how the spatial characteristics of species distributions drive the spatial pattern of priorities in multi-species conservation plans.
   2. Using datasets from Australia and Finland, we explore how excluding or including a given species changes spatial priorities in a multi-species prioritization. We develop three metrics to quantify changes in priorities, and explore how these changes depend on the total number of species used in the prioritization, the spatial characteristics of the given species distribution, and how species share their space with other species used in the prioritization. We randomly selected 12 set of 10 species from each dataset, and explore the influence of each of these species in prioritizations done for a total of 10, 20, 50 or 100 species.
   3. We show that spatial priorities become increasingly stable as the number of species is increased, and that the stability of highest and lowest priority areas behave differently. When less than 50 species were used in a prioritization, intermediately rare species that occupy mostly species-poor habitats tend to have the greatest influence on priorities, whereas very rare and common species that co-occur with many other species tend to have a small influence.
   4. Our results present a systematic method to explore the stability of spatial priorities to changes in the species pool used for a conservation plan. Although the analysed two datasets differed in data type, location, scale and species composition, they both showed how using a small number of species leads to unstable spatial solutions, where the choice to include or exclude an individual species can strongly influence the conservation outcome. Our results also show that conservation planners should carefully assess the use of spatial prioritizations for identifying least important areas (e.g. for development) as these can be particularly unstable when the prioritization is based on a small number of species.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE OF 536-537 AD IN ESTONIA AND NEIGHBOURING AREAS

LA  - English

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - In 536-541 AD a short-term and sudden cooling took place in the northern hemisphere. Archaeological and palynological data reveal that this event caused crop failure and demographic catastrophe in what is today Estonia. It took until at least the end of the 9th century to return to the previous population level. As a result of this crisis, previous power relations, trade networks, and handicraft traditions were disrupted, settlement structures transformed, and the entire world view of people changed. The climate catastrophe may have influenced the development of agriculture in Estonia. One can assume that the predominance of rye cultivation in Estonia in the second half of the first millennium is a result of the climate anomaly of 536-537.
   In Finland, where hunting and fishing were the main livelihoods and thus land cultivation was of marginal importance, the climate catastrophe does not show in the archaeological record as a decrease of archaeological finds as it does in Estonia or eastern Sweden. One can, though, observe disruptions of the previous trade networks due to the events of 536-541 and the formation of new ones. These changes had an important role in forming both the unique material culture of the Finnish Merovingian Period and in expanding land cultivation in the area of southern Finland during the next few hundred years.
   The impact of the catastrophe of 536 was so substantial that it could be considered an important threshold in the Estonian archaeological chronology. It is then that the greatest cultural upheaval since the major changes between the Early and Late Bronze Age are visible. It would be appropriate to set the border date between the Migration Period and Pre-Viking Age approximately in the year 550. Another advantage of this date is that it allows the Estonian Iron Age periodization to be synchronized with those used in the Scandinavian countries and Finland.

AB  - Societies aiming for a sustainable future need more effective and legitimate planning and decision making practices, in which various actors together find pathways towards a sustainable transition. In this paper, we approach sustainability and environmental justice as epistemological (and ontological) challenges for land-use planning, and empirically analyse how action research could support planners' social learning and planning towards fair and sustainable development. We analysed qualitatively the evolution of the researcher-planner dialogue while co-designing and developing better methods, means and practices to improve environmental justice in regional scale planning in Kymenlaakso Region, South-East Finland. We found that researcher-planner dialogue developed during cooperation. While in the beginning, social learning related to approaching environmental justice as a fair distribution of power evolved incrementally, later, when dialogue became more focused, communicative and reflective as an outcome of mutual frames and trust, learning occurred in a more transformative way. Such transformative learning concerned recognising youth as a silent group in the planning process and the means to involve their perceptions in planning. In order to support sustainability transformation in the future, we conclude that it is essential to create opportunities for such incremental and transformative social learning through innovative modes of interaction in various contexts.

AB  - This paper assesses Ghana's offshore health and safety regulatory regime in the context of international best practice in the upstream oil and gas industry. It contributes to the discussion of the emerging issue of offshore risk regulation in new petroleum producing countries. We present a comparative analysis contrasting two leading safety regimes namely the United Kingdom and Norway to Ghana's emerging regime to benchmark common features as well as weaknesses. Our findings indicate that Ghana requires a robust regulatory regime that ensures that health and safety risks are properly delineated if the country is to avoid catastrophic accidents. This is especially important as these risks are more pronounced with deepwater operations such as those prevalent in the country's petroleum basins. We propose the enactment of a general Health & Safety at Work law in Ghana backed by subsidiary regulations to harmonise the disjointed and sometimes incoherent health and safety provisions. Additionally, we propose that the health and safety regulatory function of the Ghana Petroleum Commission should be decoupled to form an independent Competent Authority as activity levels and the degree of complexity of operations increase to prevent conflict of interest between its regulatory and licensing functions.

AB  - Increasing urbanization, and the environmental and liveability impacts associated with urban activity, have directed attention to the need for sustainable cities. Achieving sustainable urban development requires including freight systems in strategic urban development plans. In this context, joint efforts involving academia and public- and private sector to collect the right data and develop suitable models, can contribute toward a better understanding of establishments' freight needs, the quantification of freight's traffic impacts and the development of appropriate methods to support decision making and strategic plans. This paper studies urban commercial establishments' freight needs and impacts on traffic using data collected from establishments in the City of Gothenburg (Sweden). The data cover different zones of the city and include commercial sectors found typically in urban cores (e.g., retailers, food services, health care, public sector offices and education). The paper introduces a set of statistical models developed based on regression analyses and discrete choice models-to estimate the number of freight trips produced and attracted per week, and the attraction of weight and volumes of freight. In addition to shed light on the factors determining establishments' freight- and freight trips generation, the models are designed with the purpose of assisting planning and policy design efforts, thus the explanatory variables are selected based on suitability and availability. The results show that retailers of perishable goods have the highest freight trip generation per establishment, followed by public sector offices and education establishments, retailers of non-perishable goods and restaurants. The results also reveal a heterogeneity between sectors, and a differential business size effect across commercial sectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shells of Arctica islandica collected between 1884 and 2004 from A-resund, Kattegat and Skagerrak (Swedish West Coast) were used to monitor local climate variations and the influence of human activities on the local environment. For this purpose, we analysed the growth, structure and chemical composition of these shells and compared them with shells collected from Kiel Bay, Norway and Iceland. The growth rate of the studied shells registers an NAO periodicity of ca 8 years. However, the observed signal is weak because of other environmental interferences that are either of natural or anthropogenic origin. For example, the oxygen isotope ratios show temperature fluctuation, but also the influx of low salinity water. Higher contents of S, N, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and P in shell portions formed during the last century are related to human activities such as mining and industrial development. Our study indicates that in order to use Arctica shells as archives of climate change it is necessary to study the full range of environmental data that is recorded in the shells by using a multi element and isotope approach in combination with different analytical techniques including investigation of growth rates and shell structure.

AB  - During the last century (1900s) industrialized forms of agriculture and human activities have caused eutrophication of Baltic Sea waters. As a consequence, the hypoxic zone in the Baltic Sea has increased, especially during the last 50 years, and has caused severe ecosystem disturbance. Climate forcing has been proposed to be responsible for the reported trends in hypoxia (< 2 mg/l O-2) both during the last c. 100 years (since c. 1900 AD) and the Medieval Period. By contrast, investigations of the degree of anthropogenic forcing on the ecosystem on long time-scales (millennial and greater) have not been thoroughly addressed. This paper examines evidence for anthropogenic disturbance of the marine environment beyond the last century through the analysis of the human population growth, technological development and land-use changes in the drainage area. Natural environmental changes, i.e. changes in the morphology and depths of the Baltic basin and the sills, were probably the main driver for large-scale hypoxia during the early Holocene (8000-4000 cal yr BP). We show that hypoxia during the last two millennia has followed the general expansion and contraction trends in Europe and that human perturbation has been an important driver for hypoxia during that time. Hypoxia occurring during the Medieval Period coincides with a doubling of the population (from c. 4.6 to 9.5 million) in the Baltic Sea watershed, a massive reclamation of land in both established and marginal cultivated areas and significant increases in soil nutrient release. The role of climate forcing on hypoxia in the Baltic Sea has yet to be demonstrated convincingly, although it could have helped to sustain hypoxia through enhanced salt water inflows or through changes in hydrological inputs. In addition, cyanobacteria blooms are not natural features of the Baltic Sea as previously deduced, but are a consequence of enhanced phosphorus release from the seabed that occurs during hypoxia.

AB  - Forest industry portfolio diversification into transport fuels is important for Swedish climate and energy policy goal achievement, and for Swedish forest industry competitiveness. This paper presents the research background and methodologyfor a project that examines constraints/drivers to the expansion of Swedish forest-derived transport biofuels. It focuses on the interaction of innovation niches with the incumbent socio-technical regime, and the interplay of innovators as they seek to advance their technology systems. The study is on-going and about to enter field interviews using this preparatory work as a base. Literature reviews, interviews and web-survey(s) are to deliver improved understanding of the positions/views and activities of transportation biofuel producers, heavy transport motor platform developers, and incumbent petrochemical industry actors. Theinvestigation addresses a) synergies or competition for resources or political support; b) proponent strategies in forest, biofuel and petrochemical sectors; c) general 'viability perceptions' for leading fuel-engine systems/pathways. It is to provide improved knowledge for decision-making to policy makers, industry, and researchers, regarding the structural function of important regime level drivers and constraints - and where policy interventions are a help/hinder to desired progress. This article delivers the theoretical considerations, research approach, and a mapping of research targets.

AB  - Introduction: "Blue Economy" refers to ocean-based economies with a sustainable approach. It focuses in smaller carbon footprints and efficiency, principles that can be applied to aquaculture. However, it has been difficult to develop successful blue economy projects in sea urchin aquaculture. Objective: To compare URCHINOMICS (Norway) and ARBACIA (Argentina). two aquaculture projects with different business models. Methods: We used publicly available information to compare both companies on the basis of their value proposition and tensions (e.g. cultural, social economic and technological). Results: To be successful, sea urchin aquaculture requires development of appropriate technology, open innovation and cooperation of people with different academic, business and organizational backgrounds. Conclusion: The ultimate success of these and similar companies will depend on free interaction of experts from multiple fields and on technological innovation.

AB  - The areal extent and configuration of thickets of willow shrubs are currently changing in the Arctic both as an effect of global warming and changed browsing pressure of reindeer. These changes have been predicted to impact the distribution and abundance of wildlife species relying on willow thickets as habitat. We assessed the relation between variables quantifying willow thicket configuration and population dynamics of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in three riparian regions in Finnmark, northern Norway, which were subject to intense browsing by semi-domesticated reindeer. The tundra vole, which exhibits 5-year population cycles in Finnmark, is the dominant small rodent species in riparian landscape elements in southern arctic tundra. In the course of a 4-year trapping study, tundra vole populations went through the cyclic phases of increase, peak and crash, however, with distinct differences between the three regions in the population dynamics. Within regions, the occupancy pattern during the increase phase was positively related to willow thicket configuration (in particular edge density and willow height) only in the region attaining the highest abundance and occupancy. However, local abundance was not clearly related to habitat features within any regions. The lack of consistency in the response of tundra vole populations to willow thicket configuration, as well as the positive relation between the degree of thicket shredding and tundra vole habitat occupancy in one of the regions, indicates that tundra voles will not be much affected by climate or browsing induced changes in the shrubbiness of the tundra in the future.

AB  - In the light of the observed and projected regional warming trend in northern Europe, new recommendations are needed for climate-proofing the selection of forest trees seedlings and growth estimates. Drawing on recently developed climate data sets, both observations of the recent past, and scenarios for the future we present and analyse a set of climate indices tailored to be used for operational forestry applications.
   Data covering Sweden and Finland include two high-resolution gridded observational data sets of daily mean temperature and daily total precipitation for the period 1961-2007, and an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections based on forcing data from six global scenarios representing a medium high emission scenario. The observation-based data sets are used as reference in two ways; as reference for downscaling and bias-adjustment of daily data from the regional scenarios and to highlight recent observed climate changes and how these changes are represented in the RCM ensemble.
   For seasonal temperature and related climate indices, there is a clear change towards warmer conditions between the two periods 1961-1990 and 1988-2007, most clearly seen in the observational data and less pronounced in the RCM ensemble. For the future period 2035-2065, 'mid-century', the medium high scenario ensemble used in this study shows substantial changes to several key indices relevant to forestry applications.

AB  - Frequently the media report on extreme floods from all over the world. Many of these cause large economic damage to society and even loss of lives, while it is very seldom that they do not pose severe threats to economic assets. Some cover large areas with the gradual inundation of the land being the main issue; others influence only small areas, where intensities can be extremely high and erosion may be a major problem. The meaning of extreme is related to probability, damage potential and scale. These issues are discussed in the context of Norwegian floods during the last 200 years.

AB  - The aim of our article is to follow how global policy models affect local policy making. Each city has unique local challenges in promoting development, e.g. economic growth, but also needs to find a balance between these targets and demands for sustainable city solutions. In our empirical study, we follow how ideas of waterfront development - to attract new inhabitants and promote economic growth - and global demands of carbon control were used interactively in a strategic spatial planning process in the city of Tampere, Finland. During the six-year planning process, these two policy targets became interdependent, created a new policy-making domain, and led to a combinatorial development of sustainability elements arising from this domain. These findings demonstrate the serial use of global policy models in the creation of a local urban sustainability fix'. To conclude, the intertwinement of diverse global policy models in a city planning process creates easily a recursive cycle that redefines urban sustainability within cities and intercity networks. This perspective makes local policy narratives and strategic planning highly important in urban sustainability research as promoting urban sustainability becomes an inherently ambivalent practice.

TI  - Securing Crop Genetic Diversity: Reconciling EU Seed Legislation and Biodiversity Treaties
T2  - REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA  - English
AB  - In May 2015, the European Commission withdrew its proposal for a new Regulation on Plant Reproductive Material. For decades, the European Union (EU) has struggled to strike a balance between seed legislation and the rights of farmers to save and exchange seed. The shelving of the draft Regulation was a major setback, given the need for legislative action in the aftermath of the Kokopelli judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU. This article discusses EU seed legislation in light of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. It analyses possible options and dilemmas for Norway in reconciling commitments to promote effective and high-quality food production in a well-functioning market, and securing long-term crop genetic diversity. Norway's association with the internal market through the European Economic Area Agreement, as well as the fact that the Norwegian seed market is small and of scant interest to major seed companies, indicate that Norway enjoys flexibility in policy design. The article finds that EU seed legislation does not allow effective regimes for exchange and use of conservation varieties, possibly at odds with the two treaties and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.

AB  - The Swedish Water Management Research Programme (VASTRA) focuses on the development and demonstration of tools for more efficient eutrophication control when implementing the EU water framework directive in Sweden. During the first half of the programme, models for nitrogen flow were developed, and at present, similar models for phosphorus are under construction (e.g. HBV-P). The programme is interdisciplinary, and scientists are collaborating in actor-games and focus group evaluations including scenario analysis. The scenarios modelled in VASTRA phase 1, show that (i) changed agricultural practices can be the most effective and-least expensive way to reduce nitrogen transport from land to, the sea; (ii) constructed agricultural wetlands may only have small impact on riverine nitrogen transport in some regions, due to natural hydrometeorological dynamics; (iii) removing planktivorous fish may be an efficient way of reducing the algal concentrations in lakes without the undesired side-effect of increased nutrient load to the down-stream river system. In VASTRA phase 11, one of the highlights will be interdisciplinary scenario-modelling of different measure strategies in a pilot catchment of southern Sweden (Ronne a).

AB  - The semiochemical diversity hypothesis (SDH) states that interference with host-selection from non-host volatiles (NHV) is an important mechanism for associational resistance. Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to point sources by non-host volatiles (NHV) is well established and might be a signal serving in host-selection also at the habitat scale. In forests dominated by Norway spruce in middle and northern Europe (N Slovakia 2006 & 2007, SE Sweden 2007), we applied a blend of NHV and verbenone, released from dispensers fixed at 2 and 6 m height at forest edges with high Ips typographus populations. In Slovakia, three different doses (0.20.7 dispensers/m forest edge) were tested in 20-tree zones of spruce stand edges. The Swedish experiments used only the middle dose. In Slovakia, there was high tree mortality but dispensers with the anti-attractants reduced killed trees in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in tree killing ranged from 35 to 76% compared to untreated zones. Regression analysis of relative tree kill on log dispenser density was highly significant ( R-Adj(2)= 0.34, corresponding effect size d approximate to 0.98). In Sweden, with lower beetle populations, most attacks (99%) were found outside the experimental areas, with high attack rates (15 trees/ha) in a range of 1530 m from treated groups, indicating an active inhibitory radius exceeding the previous estimates. The SDH as a functional aspect of biodiversity was tested by converting spruce monocultures into an artificial semiochemically mixed forests. The use of NHV provides the only non-insecticidal method of direct protection of conifer forests. The demonstrated principle of protection is still too expensive for area-wide use, but viable for high-value areas (nature reserves). Further development of pushpull strategies or area-wide applications may prove more cost efficient. In the long-term, the only sustainable approach is a forest landscape of mixed habitats.

AB  - A transition matrix model of an uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand is presented. The transition probabilities are based on material from 48 study plots in eastern Finland. The ingrowth of the transition matrix is based on material from 8 study plots and on previous studies. In the model runs the sustainable harvest proportion for 5 years varied between 7 and 20% of the stocking depending on the stand basal area. The shape of the stand diameter distribution had no notable effect on the sustainable harvest proportion. The extension of the thinning interval from 5 to 10 years slightly reduced the total removal during the simulation time.

AB  - It has been suggested that species richness in agricultural ecosystems depends on both landscape heterogeneity and farm management, but how these factors affect species composition is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the species composition of plants, butterflies, and carabid beetles in three different habitats (cereal fields, leys, and semi-natural pastures) in relation to farm management (conventional vs. organic) and landscape complexity at 16 farms in south-eastern Sweden. The farms were divided into eight pairs of one conventional and one organic farm based on land use, location, and landscape features to enable us to separate the effects of landscape features and farm management on species composition.
   Habitat type explained most of the variation in species composition of butterflies, carabids, and plants. Landscape features in the surrounding landscape explained additional variation, but little relative to habitat, in species composition. The effect of landscape features was larger in the disturbed habitats (cereal fields and ley) than in the more stable semi-natural pastures. Moreover, the effect of landscape features was largest for the most mobile group, butterflies, and least for the sessile plants. The percentage of ley (land temporarily with perennial grass and clover) was the most important landscape feature for butterfly and plant species composition, whereas landscape heterogeneity was the most important landscape feature for carabid species composition. Farm management explained some additional variation in species composition of carabids and butterflies, but it was of minor importance compared to landscape features for species composition of butterflies and plants. We classified the species as common or rare, but for no taxa were common or rare species associated with any landscape feature or farm management.

TI  - Assessing structural diversity in managed forests
T2  - ASSESSMENT OF BIODIVERSITY FOR IMPROVED FOREST PLANNING
LA  - English
CP  - Conference on Assessment of Biodiversity for Improved Planning
AB  - Many spatial scales are recognised within multi-objective forest management, but relatively little is known about the effects of current management regimes on biodiversity at a stand level in British forests. This is important, as most management operations are carried out at this level within commercial forests. This paper describes one aspect of a project to assess forest biodiversity at the stand level, namely the description of vertical stand structure. The Project aims to assess levels of biodiversity associated with plantation stands, through the evaluation of new field assessment methods, the collection of baseline data, and an appraisal of the effects of management through the complete range of structural classes generated by clearfelling and replanting silvicultural methods. In other countries, chronosequences have been examined for this purpose.
   A three-year project has been initiated to collect baseline ecological data for major plantation forest types in the UK - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Corsican pine (Pinus nigra var, maritima), and oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea). This information will then be compared with data obtained from analogous semi-natural and high conservation value forests, to help define appropriate target levels of biodiversity that should be achievable within plantations. In addition to generating these baseline data, the project aims to identify key biodiversity indicators for validation and use in future assessment programmes, and the development and monitoring of biodiversity standards. These are standards which are relevant to the site type in question, which are ecologically robust, are clearly understood and acceptable to forest managers and other stakeholders, and which use methodologies which are repeatable and easy to use.
   A standardised series of assessments are being undertaken in target sampling areas, comprised of one hectare plots (one within each structure class), and using methods which take account of patterns and processes at larger spatial scales. It is intended that this work be extended to assess landscape scale variation and to incorporate additional forest types and management regimes across Europe, along a forest exploitation and climatic continuum.
   This work aims to provide a baseline against which the impacts of changes in management to achieve desired future conditions (targets) can be compared. These targets are defined in terms of structural, compositional and functional attributes of biodiversity, as applied to plantation forest ecosystems. Appropriate levels for these need Co lake into consideration factors such as pre-afforestation habitat types, physio-chemical site limitations, and the ecological uniqueness of plantation forests in the United Kingdom.

AB  - The indoors is where many humans spend most of their time, and are strongly exposed to indoor microbiota, which may have multifaceted effects on health. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of indoor microbiota is necessary. We collected dust samples from 295 homes of families with young children in the Helsinki region of Finland and analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition based on the 16S rRNA and ITS DNA sequences. Microbial profiles were combined with extensive survey data on family structure, daily life, and physical characteristics of the home, as well as additional external environmental information, such as land use, and vegetational biodiversity near the home. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance we explained 18% of the variation of the relative abundance between samples within bacterial composition, and 17% of the fungal composition with the explanatory variables. The fungal community was dominated by the phyla Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota; the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were dominant. The presence of dogs, multiple children, and firewood were significantly associated with both the fungal and bacterial composition. Additionally, fungal communities were associated with land use, biodiversity in the area, and the type of building, while bacterial communities were associated with the human inhabitants and cleaning practices. A distinction emerged between members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, Ascomycota being more abundant in homes with greater surrounding natural environment, and potential contact with the environment. The results suggest that the fungal composition is strongly dependent on the transport of outdoor environmental fungi into homes, while bacteria are largely derived from the inhabitants.

AB  - Climate change is a fundamental challenge for which agriculture is sensitive and vulnerable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified relevant information as key to enabling appropriate climate adaptation and mitigation action. Information specifically directed to farmers can be found, for example, in specialized farming magazines. While recent studies examine how national news media frame climate change, less-if any-studies have addressed climate framings and coverage in specializedmedia. Media framings are storylines that provide meaning by communicating how and why an issue should be seen as a problem, how it should be handled, and who is responsible for it. This paper analyses the framings and coverage of climate change in two Swedish specialized farming magazines from 2000 to 2009. It examines the extent of the climate change coverage, the content of the media items, and the dominant framings underlying their climate change coverage. The study identifies: increased coverage of climate change starting in 2007; frequent coverage of agriculture's contribution to climate change, climate change impacts on agriculture, and consequences of climate politics for agriculture; and four prominent frames: conflict, scientific certainty, economic burden, and action. The paper concludes that climate change communicators addressing farmers and agricultural extension officers should pay attention to how these frames may be interpreted by different target audiences. Research is needed on how specialized media reports on climate-related issues and how science-based climate information is understood by different groups of farmers and which other factors influence farmers' engagement in climate mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The global potential for wind power generation is vast, and the number of installations is increasing rapidly. We review case studies from around the world of the effects on raptors of wind-energy development. Collision mortality, displacement, and habitat loss have the potential to cause population-level effects, especially for species that are rare or endangered. The impact on raptors has much to do with their behavior, so careful siting of wind-energy developments to avoid areas suited to raptor breeding, foraging, or migration would reduce these effects. At established wind farms that already conflict with raptors, reduction of fatalities may be feasible by curtailment of turbines as raptors approach, and offset through mitigation of other human causes of mortality such as electrocution and poisoning, provided the relative effects can be quantified. Measurement of raptor mortality at wind farms is the subject of intense effort and study, especially where mitigation is required by law, with novel statistical approaches recently made available to improve the notoriously difficult-to-estimate mortality rates of rare and hard-to-detect species. Global standards for wind farm placement, monitoring, and effects mitigation would be a valuable contribution to raptor conservation worldwide.

AB  - The 2018 drought in Sweden prompted questions about climate-adaptation and -mitigation measures - especially in the agricultural sector, which suffered the most. This study applies a water-food-energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in Sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies. A previous water-food-energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data-driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines. Moreover, the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored. The assimilation of leaf area index data from the Copernicus Global Land Service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters. The results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019. This is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition (ETc)-driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. During the drought year 2018, the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines. Nevertheless, the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10% and 60% as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios. During a normal year, the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines. The modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields, with yield reductions of up to 30%. From a water-food-energy nexus, this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes. By using an open-source package for Google Earth (R), a demonstrator of cost-effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers, and water- and energy-management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use, and food production. This can be significant, especially during the occurrence of extreme events, but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes.

AB  - It has recently been recommended that a shift from traditional flood prevention to more adaptive strategies is made, focusing on the reduction in and recovery from flood impacts as a means to improve resilience to climate impacts. This shift has had implications for the public-private divide in adaptive flood risk governance. In an urban context, it means that private actors such as developers and residents come into play, necessitating governance arrangements which cross the public-private divide. The division of responsibilities for water safety between the public and private sectors affects the way legitimacy is gained for these arrangements and raises new legitimacy issues. The paper offers an analysis of public and private responsibilities in adaptive flood risk governance arrangements, as well as of the legitimacy of the arrangements in the light of the public-private divide. A comparative case study is presented for three urban regeneration projects in un-embanked areas in Hamburg, Germany, Helsinki, Finland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where adaptive strategies have been applied. The results show that network arrangements with joint public-private responsibilities use direct forms of participation and deliberation, but that these do not necessarily lead to more legitimate arrangements in the eyes of stakeholders as is often suggested in the literature. Both network and more public hierarchical arrangements can be perceived as quite legitimate under certain conditions.

AB  - Forest management practices have led to a reduction in the volume and a change in the composition of coarse woody debris (CWD) in many forest types. This study compared CWD volume and composition in reserves and two types of managed forest in the central boreal zone of Sweden. Ten areas were surveyed, each containing clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth stands, to determine the volume of standing and lying CWD in terms of species composition, decay class and size class. Volumes of CWD on clear-cuts and in mature managed forests were high compared with previous studies. Old-growth forests (72.6 m(3) ha(-1)) contained a greater volume of CWD than mature managed forests (23.3 m(3) ha(-1)) and clear- cuts (13.6 m(3) ha(-1)). Differences were greatest for the larger size classes and intermediate decay stages. Despite stand ages being up to 144 years, CWD volume and composition in managed forests was more similar to clear- cuts than to old-growth forests.

AB  - Conservation of the Critically Endangered ringed seal Phoca hispida saimensis population in Lake Saimaa in Finland requires broader knowledge of the behavioural ecology of this subspecies. Understanding Saimaa ringed seal haulout patterns and their response to boat traffic is crucial for designing sustainable land use and tourism guidelines. Responses of unidentified seals to small outboard motor boat traffic were studied during the moulting season. The median distance at which the seals responded to an approaching boat was 240 m. GPS-phone tags were used to study both circadian and seasonal haulout behaviour patterns of individual seals (n = 8) during the open-water season. The average post-moulting haulout duration was 6 +/- 5 h (SD), with a maximum of over 26 h. The seals spent more time hauled out at night (between 21:00 and 06:00 h) after the moult. The time spent hauled out and the haulout frequency declined from early summer to autumn. An individual seal had an average of 13 haulout sites, which were an average of 2.5 km apart. Approximately half of these haulout sites were located in the core 50% of the individual seals' home ranges. The high level of site fidelity emphasizes the need to identify suitable haulout areas and to develop measures for protecting the main resting sites of this endangered population. Additionally, guidelines for seal watching should be developed in order to mitigate the potential disturbance caused by increasing tourism on Lake Saimaa.

AB  - Recent research in northern Europe has revised many long-held conceptions of the complexity of forest ecosystems and their natural structure and dynamics. The unveiling of the picture of natural characteristics of forest ecosystem structure and dynamics reveals much more diversity than its traditional complement, highlighting the importance of non-stand-replacing disturbances and the associated heterogeneous and dynamic stand and landscape structures. This increasing detail is a reflection of a fundamental change in the ecological understanding of forests as complex ecosystems. In particular, the generalization that the boreal forest is regulated by fierce stand-replacing disturbances, leading to the dominance of even-aged stand successions, has been disproved. However, this misconception has, until now, been repeated and used to legitimize the dominant practice of clear-cutting as a nature-based way to manage the forest. The practical conclusion of this review paper is that the dominating forest management model in North European boreal forests, which is based on the clear-cut harvesting of timber and growing of even-aged stands, is in contradiction with the variable and complex characteristics of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in naturally dynamic forests with negligible human impact. As a consequence, the structural variation of the boreal forest under management has been grossly truncated compared with its natural range. Because of this, and due to the scarcity of protection areas in many regions of northern Europe, it is not likely that the conservation of native biodiversity and ecological sustainability will be attained, assuming that the model of forest management remains unchanged. Thus, there is a strong incentive for change in the prevailing forest management model toward one that is based on natural ecosystem dynamics and an understanding of forests as complex systems.

AB  - In Fennoscandian boreal forests, aspen (Populus tremula) is one of the most important tree species for biodiversity. In this study we explore how occupancy and density of beetles associated with dead aspen are related to habitat patch size and connectedness in a 45,000 ha boreal managed forest landscape in central Sweden. Patch size was estimated as amount of breeding substrate and connectedness as crown cover of living aspen in the surrounding landscape. The beetles were sampled by sieving of bark or by inspection of species-characteristic galleries in 56 patches with dead aspen. Six of nine aspen-associated species (Xylotrechus rusticus, Ptilinus fuscus, Mycetophagus fulvicollis, Cyphaea curtula, Homalota plana and Endomychus coccineus) showed a positive significant relationship between habitat patch size and occupancy. For all these species, except C. curtula, there was also a significant positive relationship between patch size and density. Connectedness was not retained as a significant variable in the analyses. Species not defined as aspen-associated constituted a significantly larger proportion of the total density of individuals of saproxylic beetles in smaller habitat patches than in larger patches. Richness of aspen-associated species was positively related to habitat patch size. Efforts in the managed forest should be directed towards preserving and creating larger patches of living and dead aspen trees and increasing the amount of aspen at the landscape level.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate pollen-vegetation relationships on a local scale and to identify grazed and mown vegetation types by their pollen assemblages. Vegetation frequency analysis and pollen analysis of surface moss polsters from grazed and mown vegetation types in western Norway were carried out. Five one-square-metre plots within 10 x 10 m plots from 36 different sites were investigated using classification (TWINSPAN, DISCRIM) and ordination (correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis) methods. The pollen assemblages reflected the local vegetation and there was good agreement between the classifications and ordinations of the two data sets. This agreement occurred despite both the inclusion of extralocal and regional pollen and the low representation of entomophilous species affecting the pollen assemblages. Gradients were found in the pollen assemblages relating to land-use practices as well as geographical regions. Pollen assemblages from heath were separated from the other investigated vegetation types and characterized by high percentages of Calluna. A pollen-analytical separation of mown meadows from grazed sites was identified, whereas a separation between mown meadows and grazed sites which had previously been mown was found to be unclear. Plantago lanceolata, Rumex acetosa type, Ranunculus acris type, and Asteraceae Cichorioideae were common in both mown and grazed vegetation types. Galium type, Cirsium type, and Succisa were more associated with grazing than mowing, whereas the opposite was true for e.g. Achillea type, Alchemilla, and Conopodium majus type and several pollen types were connected with the mown meadows. The modern pollen assemblages from mown and grazed vegetation types may aid in the identification of past hay meadows and pastures from local pollen diagrams. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The demand for wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations as a renewable energy source is currently increasing and could affect biodiversity in agricultural areas. The objective was to evaluate the contribution of SRC plantations to phytodiversity in agricultural landscapes assessed as species richness, speciesarea relationships, Shannon indices, detrended correspondence analysis on species composition, Sorensen similarities, habitat preference proportions, and species proportions found in only one land use. Vegetation surveys were conducted on 12 willow (Salix spp.) and three poplar (Populus spp.) coppice sites as well as on surrounding arable lands, grasslands and forests in central Sweden and northern Germany. SRC plantations were richer in plant species (mean: 30 species per 100 m(2)) than arable land (10), coniferous forests (13) and mixed forests in Germany (12). Comparing SRC plantations with other land uses, we found lowest similarities in species composition with arable lands, coniferous forests and German mixed forests and highest similarities with marginal grassland strips, grasslands and Swedish mixed forests. Similarity depended on the SRC tree cover: at increased tree cover, SRC plantations became less similar to grasslands but more similar to forests. The SRC plantations were composed of a mixture of grassland (33%), ruderal (24%) and woodland (15%) species. Species abundance in SRC plantations was more heterogeneous than in arable lands. We conclude that SRC plantations form novel habitats leading to different plant species composition compared to conventional land uses. Their landscape-scale value for phytodiversity changes depending on harvest cycles and over time. As a structural landscape element, SRC plantations contribute positively to phytodiversity in rural areas, especially in land use mosaics where these plantations are admixed to other land uses with dissimilar plant species composition such as arable land, coniferous forest and, at the German sites, also mixed forest.

AB  - In urban landscapes, humans are the most significant factor determining belowground diversity, including earthworms. Within the framework of the Global Urban Soil Ecology and Education Network (GLUSEEN), a multi-city comparison was carried out to assess the effects of soil disturbance on earthworms. In each of five cities (Baltimore, USA; Budapest, Hungary; Helsinki and Lahti, Finland; Potchefstroom, South Africa), covering four climatic and biogeographical regions, four habitat types (ruderal, turf/lawn, remnant and reference) were sampled. The survey resulted in 19 species belonging to 9 genera and 4 families. The highest total species richness was recorded in Baltimore (16), while Budapest and the Finnish cities had relatively low (5-6) species numbers. Remnant forests and lawns supported the highest earthworm biomass. Soil properties (i.e. pH and organic matter content) explained neither earthworm community composition nor abundance. Evaluating all cities together, earthworm communities were significantly structured by habitat type. Communities in the two adjacent cities, Helsinki and Lahti were very similar, but Budapest clearly separated from the Finnish cities. Earthworm community structure in Baltimore overlapped with that of the other cities. Despite differences in climate, soils and biogeography among the cities, earthworm communities were highly similar within the urban habitat types. This indicates that human-mediated dispersal is an important factor shaping the urban fauna, both at local and regional scales.

AB  - The increasing number of deteriorating old dams that need renovation or have lost their function make dam removal a viable management option. There are at least four major reasons for dam removal: safety, law and policy, economy, and ecology. Here we discuss 17 Swedish dams that were recently considered for removal. Because dam removal usually causes controversy, dam removal initiatives may succeed, fail, or result in a compromise such as a bypass channel for migrating fish. We identify and discuss three major obstructions to dam removal: funding, cultural-historical values, and threatened species. To facilitate dam removal, the reasons for, and the effects of, dam removal must be carefully explained, and the public and stakeholders must be kept informed. In complicated cases in which compromise solutions may be the most feasible outcome, the integration of the knowledge of different stakeholders is crucial. The involvement of diverse stakeholders increases their willingness to find compromises, thus avoiding conflicts and failures.

AB  - Ecologists are developing methods for the design of reserve systems, but non-ecological factors or criteria may limit their applicability (e.g. threat, initiative, low-cost 'opportunities'). Threat before reserve acquisition (i.e. direct threat, contributing to reserve establishment) and the actors proposing reserves were studied for a random sample of 84 nature reserves with forest in southern Sweden, established 1926-1996. A direct threat was recorded for about 40% of these reserves before they were acquired. The remaining reserves had not been directly threatened, although indirect threat probably contributed to establishment of several reserves. Threat was an important factor in this productive lowland area, but for reserves in larger regions with varied topography (e.g. Sweden) mainly alpine or low-productive areas is represented, and threat seems to be of minor importance. Decisions for the 84 reserves were taken by one main conservation agency, which however initiated less than 50% of the reserves. External actors, such as other authorities, idealistic organisations and private individuals were also important initiators, suggesting that actors in the reserve process should be studied in biodiversity programs. Strong arguments for protection, careful planning, and flexibility with respect to non-ecological factors (that probably cannot be eliminated) may be successful tactics to establish more reserves with high biological values.

AB  - The agricultural environments of forest-dominated northern Europe are different from those in southern Europe. One could expect corresponding differences in the ecology of farmland birds such as the Skylark. We studied the habitat characteristics of the Skylark in an agricultural landscape of 30 km(2) in southern Finland. GIS-based methods were applied to analyse the habitat associations and distribution of Skylark territories. We found that landscape factors were associated with Skylark occurrence: the species was always present in sufficiently large patches of farmland (> 11.5 ha). Skylarks avoided forest edges, and the isolation of farmland areas also decreased the probability of Skylark occurrence. Year-round vegetative cover of fields and the amount of open ditches (ditch margins) had a positive effect on Skylark density. Set-aside regimes and buffer zones along ditches would thus be beneficial to northern Skylark populations.

AB  - We studied a short sediment core from Lake Hamptrask, southern Finland, for evidence of the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) in aquatic invertebrate communities. Subfossil chironomids, cladocerans, and chydorid ephippia were investigated, together with detrended correspondence analyses (DCAs) and loss-on-ignition (LOI). Our results show two cooler periods. The first cooling, indicated by increased numbers of chydorid ephippia and cold-water chironomid taxa, occurred ca. 1400 AD and the second, more drastic cooling, during the seventeenth century, when cold-water chironomids began to increase. Our data suggest that the cooling culminated around 1700 AD, when cold-stenothermic chironomids and chydorid ephippia attained maximal values and the LOI and diversity of invertebrates decreased to minimal values. After the LIA, the aquatic fauna appeared to respond to rising trophic state caused by enhanced land use in the catchment.

AB  - This paper examines the attitudes towards experience industries and tourism in the Gnosjo region of Sweden. The investigation is based on a questionnaire and follow-up interviews with politicians and chief executive officers (CEOs) within manufacturing industries. The results show that the politicians have more knowledge of experience industries and a more positive attitude towards these new types of industries than the CEOs. Both groups consider both these industries of significance for the region's future. While the politicians believe in experience industries as a whole, and particularly suggest more active work in favour of tourism and design, the second group just welcomes directly and indirectly a possible cooperation with design companies. A minor share of the CEOs is interested in either running businesses with features of experience industries or having a sense of it in their businesses. Despite differences, these attitudes facilitate cross-fertilisation between the manufacturing industry and experience industries in the future. The study suggests that the region needs to develop more knowledge and competence directed towards the experience industries, in particular tourism and design, and a cooperation between the manufacturing industry, local political parties, and enterprises within tourism, design and culture in this respect.

AB  - In urban environments, roads are one of the major threats for moving animals. Roads can act as barriers to movement either through mortality during crossing attempts or through behavioral avoidance. This can have severe population-level consequences such as population fragmentation and demographic or genetic isolation. A major limitation for determining the effects of roads, however, is the lack of studies on responses of animals to roads during dispersal. In a radiotelemetry study, we investigated the responses of dispersing juvenile red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) to roads in an urban environment in Finland. We observed that, during routine movements within their home range, squirrels were located further from roads and crossed them less frequently than simulated random walk paths, while they did not avoid roads when performing explorative and dispersal movements. Moreover, during routine movements squirrels rarely crossed roads with high traffic volume, whereas during dispersal, they crossed both big and small roads. Traffic did not seem to be a major cause of mortality for juvenile squirrels, based on our observations. Our study provides striking evidence that movement behavior during dispersal differs from that of nondispersers. For road ecology, this implies that the evaluation of the role of roads as barriers for, for example, gene flow cannot be based on the interpretation of movements of nondispersers.

AB  - In agro-ecosystems, environmental monitoring is fundamental to detect and survey changes related to land use change and management practices. Butterflies and moths have often been suggested as suitable indicators for monitoring environmental effects on biodiversity in farmlands. Here, we estimated the required sample size and monitoring effort necessary to run a Lepidoptera survey in European farmland, assessing in particular if monitoring investment would differ between representative bio-geographical regions.
   We operated linear 1-km long transect routes in farmland of Romania, Spain and Sweden from 2013 to 2015, and recorded butterflies and burnet moths (Papilionoidea, Zygaenidae). The transects were walked back and forth four times a season, and replicated yearly. The lepidopteran diversity was high in farmlands of Romania and Spain, but comparatively low in Sweden. The coefficient of variation (CV) of recorded species number differed between countries being lowest in Sweden and highest in Spain. In general, the CV dropped above a transect length of 400-800 m, thus indicating an increase in statistical power. Assuming a non-parametric test for matched samples, power calculations were conducted with the raw count data and with log-transformed count data for comparison. When using log-transformed data, the required sample size to detect an effect was less than 10 transects per country or region (in order to detect a 10% loss of species or a decrease of 30% in total abundance). Specific subgroups of species, e.g. protected species or specific indicator groups, showed a higher variance, thus requiring a higher sample size to detect effects ranging from 12 to 16 transects (equivalent to 21-29 working days per country and year). When using original, untransformed count data a considerably larger sample size would be needed. Actual time to be invested in field work differed between countries due to contrasting regional constraints and conditions. Nevertheless, the final monitoring effort in working days was similar between countries as the factors involved balanced out each other, in particular due to the differing year-to-year variations.
   Our study demonstrated the feasibility of an environmental monitoring programme in arable land using farmland butterflies across Europe. We present a suitable approach and guidelines as well as the necessary effort to be invested in future Europe-wide monitoring programmes of butterflies in agro-ecosystems, based on predictions of statistical power.

AB  - Freshwater bioassessment is typically based on well known taxonomic groups. Such as fish and macroinvertebrates, while less studied groups are frequently excluded front bioassessment programs. We examined the community variation of stream macroinvertebrates and macrophytes (mainly aquatic bryophytes) in near-pristine reference sites and sites impacted by agriculture, forestry. or in-stream habitat alteration in western and central Finland. We specifically examined whether these taxonomic groups exhibited concordant variation in community Structure and whether they could be used as Surrogates for each other in stream bioassessment. The effects Of human disturbance on taxonomic composition and community Structure were investigated using canonical correspondence analysis and RIVPACS-type predictive models. The community concordance between macroinvertebrates and macrophytes was higher when test sites were included, suggesting that environmental degradation may increase community concordance between different biotic groups. However, despite increased concordance, macroinvertebrates and macrophytes responded to different stressors. The sensitivity of the two groups to human disturbance also differed markedly. The macroinvertebrate model determined 13 (with P-1 = 0+ as the threshold for species inclusion) and 12 (with P-t = 0.4) Out of 35 test sites as altered, whereas the macrophyte model detected impairment for only 7 sites (both probability levels), likely because of the low species richness of macrophytes in our study streams. Low richness of macrophytes may thus hinder their use in bioassessment based on taxonomic completeness, suggesting that measures that do not rely solely on species loss might perform better in at least high-gradient boreal streams.

AB  - Agricultural activities contribute to water pollution through sediments and nutrient export, negatively affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. However, implementing best management practices (BMPs) could help control sediments and nutrient losses from agricultural catchments. This study used the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to assess the effectiveness of four BMPs in reducing sediment and phosphorus export in a small agricultural catchment (33 km2) in southeastern Sweden. The SWAT model was first evaluated for its ability to simulate streamflow, sediment load, and total phosphorous load from 2005 to 2020. Then, the calibrated parameters were used to simulate the agricultural BMP scenarios by modifying relevant parameters. The model performed satisfactorily during calibration and validation for streamflow (NSE = 0.80/0.84), sediment load (NSE = 0.67/0.69), and total phosphorous load (NSE = 0.61/0.62), indicating its suitability for this study. The results demonstrate varying effects of BMP implementation on sediment and phosphorus (soluble and total) export, with no significant change in streamflow. Filter strips were highly effective in reducing sediment (-32%), soluble phosphorus (-67%), and total phosphorous (-66%) exports, followed by sedimentation ponds with-35%,-36%, and-50% reductions, respectively. Grassed waterways and no-tillage were less impactful on pollutant reduction, with grassed waterways showing a slight increase (+4%) in soluble phosphorus and no -tillage having a minimal effect on sediment (-1.3%) and total phosphorus (-0.2%) export. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to mitigate sediment and nutrient pollution in Swedish agricultural areas, thereby supporting the conservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems, and enhancing sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF CONSUMER-MANAGED WATER COOPERATIVES IN FINLAND, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
T2  - WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - This study analyses the long-term evolution of consumer-managed water supply cooperatives in Finland, a country that used to be somewhat backward, but which is today one of the most developed countries in the world.  Much of the knowledge gained from that evolution should be applicable to the developing world.  Yet, one must be careful not to try to apply the Finnish model directly to developing countries that have different cultural backgrounds, government constitutions, and economic and social obligations.
   The Finnish experience shows that development is based on consumers' initiative.  Each party should assume the duties that exist.  Consumers should pay or otherwise cover the main part of the costs.  The government should concentrate on policy issues, promotion, and guidance.  Associations should have management responsibility, where the role of the key person, the "champion"/"prime-mover" is decisive.  The private sector could supply many of the external services.  External support agencies and developing countries should analyse the experiences and potential of water associations in their areas.  More realistic time-frames should be allowed for development cooperation projects in the sector.  Consumer-managed water supply systems exist in many other developed, and even developing countries, although largely unrecognised by the authorities.

AB  - In this article I reflect on how media tourism in the Scandinavian region is related to the popularity of the Scandinavian crime fiction industry and more recently 'Nordic Noir'. I investigate how the increasing market for film tourism influences crime fiction and television drama series. I look at the role played by television landscapes, assessing their aesthetic, narrative and economic value as series as well as in the context of the tourism industry. The success of Wallander tourism in Ystad has inspired a range of film tourism initiatives, which represent a new kind of creative and strategic collaboration between tourism, regional authorities and the television drama industry. Thus, Nordic landscapes and climate have become a commodity. I analyse the television drama series Wallander and Broen (The Bridge) as well as promotional material, film tourism websites and interviews with film tourism managers in Sweden and in Denmark. This study illustrates the aesthetics and business of television landscapes, and demonstrates how place in television is crucial to our understanding of how television drama series induce tourism. Finally, the article considers whether tourism also induces television drama productions.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of extractive industries on sustainable development requires analyzing them as part of dynamic social-ecological-technological systems. Building on insights from studies of social-ecological systems and socio-technical systems, as well as fieldwork on the impacts of mining in the Nordic Arctic, this article presents an analytical framework for co-production of knowledge about the role of industrial or infrastructure projects for regional development. We use this framework to analyze Swedish mining policy, assessment guidelines, and environmental impact assessments for three mining projects in Arctic Sweden. We conclude that Swedish mining policy and guidelines for impact assessments neglect key aspects of social-ecologicaltechnological systems, including the impacts of climate change, and treat many social aspects of sustainable development in a cursory manner. We suggest that more systematic analysis of the dynamics of social-ecologicaltechnological systems would facilitate more transparent decision making and help identify the potential role of proposed mining projects in pathways towards sustainable development in northern regions.

AB  - Climatic changes are expected to pose challenges to Nordic agriculture. While some changes may provide opportunities for higher productivity, others may severely increase agricultural vulnerability. Farmers attempt to adapt or cope with these changes by taking measures to decrease vulnerability or to take advantage of potential benefits, but little is known what outcomes these adaptation measures might have. This study identifies unintended negative impacts of adaptation measures, drawing on a literature review and interviews with farmers and agricultural officials and experts in Sweden and Finland. Based on the conceptual framework of maladaptation, this study identifies outcomes that either increase the vulnerability of the implementing actor, shift the vulnerability to other actors or sectors or affect common pool resources. While a large number of adaptation measures rebound vulnerability to the implementing actor, several potential maladaptive outcomes may shift vulnerability or affect common pool resources. The findings point to the large number of trade-offs that are involved in adaptation decision-making and lead to the conclusion that raising awareness of these aspects can support future adaptation strategies.

AB  - Sampling of airborne and deposited particles was carried out at a rural site on the Swedish west coast.  Air particles were collected using a high volume sampler (HVS) and the deposition was sampled on a 1 m2 Teflon-coated horizontal surface, with runoff for precipitation.  During a soot episode in the north of Sweden snow samples were collected.  The samples were analysed in order to identify and quantify petroleum hydrocarbons, such as aliphatics and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and to study differences in the hydrocarbon content of airborne and deposited particles.  The measured hydrocarbons in deposition and air were compared with the soot concentrations in the air.  The analyses showed that deposition of great quantities of hydrocarbons with anthropogenic origin takes place, especially during soot episodes.  There exists a qualitative difference in the hydrocarbon content in airborne and deposited particulates.  There is a covariation between the concentration of soot in the air and the deposition of especially PAH, but also to some extent the total hydrocarbons.

AB  - Reliable identification of hotspot areas with high numbers of threatened plant species has a central role in conservation planning. We investigated the potentiality of identifying the distribution, richness and hot-spots of threatened plant species at a 25 ha resolution using eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, MARS, ANN, CTA, GBM, MDA and RF) in a taiga landscape in north-eastern Finland. First, the individual species models developed based on occurrence records of 28 species in the 1677 grid squares and derived from different statistical techniques were extrapolated to the whole study area of 41 750 km(2). Second, the projected presence/absence maps were then combined to create species richness maps, and the top 5% of grid cells ranked by species richness were classified as hotspots. Finally, we created an overall summary map by combining the individual hotspot maps from all eight modelling techniques and identified areas where the individual hotspots maps overlapped most. There were distinguishing differences in projections of the geographic patterns of species richness and hotspots between the modelling techniques. Most of the modelling techniques predicted several hotspot locations sporadically around the study area. However, the overall summary map showed the highest predictive performance based on Kappa statistics, indicating that the locations where the hotspot maps from the eight models coincided most harboured highest observed species richness. Moreover, the summary map filtered out the patchy structures of individual hotspot maps. The results show that the choice of modelling technique may affect the accuracy and prediction of hotspot patterns. Such differences may hamper the development of useful biodiversity model applications for conservation planning, and thus it is beneficial if the conservation decision-making can be based on sets of alternative maps and overlaying of predictions from multiple models.

AB  - Land-use changes, pollution and climate warming during the 20th century have caused changes in biodiversity across the world. However, in many cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly selected 2.5 x 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden, conducted 1989-2006 and 2008-2015, respectively, and related the change in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement, response to grazing/mowing,response to soil disturbance), drainage (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory, parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern distribution limit explaining 30%-60% of the variance in the GLMM models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees.

AB  - We conducted a national survey on a high-quality internet panel to study landscape preferences in Norway, using photos as stimuli. We examined preference heterogeneity with respect to socio-demographic characteristics and latent topics brought up by the respondents, using ordinal logistic regression and structural topic modelling (STM), a machine learning-based analysis. We found that pasture landscapes are the most favoured (55%), while densely planted spruce forests are the least favoured (8%). The contrast was particularly strong between eastern and western Norway, between men and women, and between young and old. STM revealed that the choices were mainly driven by the preference for landscape openness, especially by women. Other important drivers were concerns regarding reforestation of former farmlands, aesthetic properties, forest management, biodiversity issues, and cultural values. Our results suggest that landscape policies may clash with socio-cultural preferences, and failure to account for these may undermine the success of a policy.

AB  - Functional forest resource planning was applied in Finland when the Sustainable Timber Management forest policy objective was followed from the 1920s up to the early 1960s. Functional planning, meaning a rational-comprehensive policy agenda, gave considerable power to the inner circle of the forest policy community for promoting their targets in the forest policy arena. Selective participation, often based on the excludability of the entrants was applied in policy processes.
   Progressive Timber Management replaced sustainable timber management as the forest policy objective. Progressive timber management was accompanied by a Keynesian active financial policy in the macroeconomics of the 1960s to 1980s. The non-governmental forestry organisations, that participated actively in income contracting, acquired the primary positions in forest policy arena. The formulation of a neo-corporatist forest policy network proceeded forest planning and the expansions in the public subsidies of the timber production investments. The neo-corporatist network included non-foresters, but the forest policy community was able to preserve their primary position through selective participation of the secondary stakeholders. Economic sustainability was the dominating paradigm, and the power relations among the most powerful policy stakeholders were preserved.
   The neo-corporatist policy agenda was challenged by the international commitments on ecological and social sustainability of forests in the early 1990s. The enforced new dimensions of sustainability released the deadlock in the forest policy arena. The first initials towards the collaborative policy approach, introduced in the context of National Environmental Program of Forestry, were proceeded in the planning process concerning public forests from the mid-1990s on.
   The neo-corporatist network of key forest policy stakeholders regained their dominant position in the preparation of Finlands National Forest Program 2010 in 1998. The program output was a symbolic national program. The program was dominated by the proposals concerning the enlargement of timber production subsidies. The steps in the implementation of the national forest program have gradually changed with respect to the features of a substantive national forest program. The three dimensions of sustainability have been strictly separated in the program process. The dominance of economic sustainability in the program output satisfied the dominant NGO forest organisations and enabled the detailed preparation of the policy actions for ecological and social sustainability. Regional Forest Councils supervise Regional Forest Programs and are able to transmit the bottom-up initiatives for changes. These regional institutions expand the forest policy arena with respect to participation and delegation. The participatory policy forums, provided for the top executives of the society and Research & Development communities respectively, open up new channels for inter-sectoral coordination.

AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cause important health problems in all cattle husbandry systems. It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination, mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal's environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development, the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD, the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health, welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.

AB  - The Climate Change Convention requires signatory countries to calculate inventories of greenhouse-gas emissions from anthropogenic activities, and from natural sources and sinks. This paper presents estimations for the Ut(, an industrialized temperate country with intensive land-use and little natural vegetation cover. The UK's 1988 anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions total 183 million tons (metric). When the net sequestration from soil and biomass is included in aggregate carbon dioxide emissions, this total is reduced by only 0.72%. Net emissions increase however for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the land-use sector. There is a need for a clear definition of the distinction between natural and anthropogenic sources where the capacity of the biosphere to act as a sink is limited by human intervention, In the method adopted here, distinction is made between emissions from activities not associated with biological activity, defined as anthropogenic, and exclusively from biological processes, with or without human intervention. The relative contributions of the different gases is also significantly affected by the time horizon, and hence the assumed global warming potential adopted for the analysis.

AB  - The importance of long-term environmental monitoring and research for detecting and understanding changes in ecosystems and human impacts on natural systems is widely acknowledged. Over the last decades, a number of critical components for successful long-term monitoring have been identified. One basic component is quality assurance/quality control protocols to ensure consistency and comparability of data. In Norway, the authorities require environmental monitoring of the impacts of the offshore petroleum industry on the Norwegian continental shelf, and in 1996, a large-scale regional environmental monitoring program was established. As a case study, we used a sub-set of data from this monitoring to explore concepts regarding best practices for long-term environmental monitoring. Specifically, we examined data from physical and chemical sediment samples and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages from 11 stations from six sampling occasions during the period 1996-2011. Despite the established quality assessment and quality control protocols for this monitoring program, we identified several data challenges, such as missing values and outliers, discrepancies in variable and station names, changes in procedures without calibration, and different taxonomic resolution. Furthermore, we show that the use of different laboratories over time makes it difficult to draw conclusions with regard to some of the observed changes. We offer recommendations to facilitate comparison of data over time. We also present a new procedure to handle different taxonomic resolution, so valuable historical data is not discarded. These topics have a broader relevance and application than for our case study.

AB  - The survey area is situated along two altitude profiles, each covering an altitude difference of about 800 m, west of Achental at the northern fringe of the Alps. From dolomite and limestone Rendzic Leptosol and Chromic Cambisol developed as predominant soil types. These are mainly resilient against (anthropogenic) depositions. Nine woodland communities (plant associations) were found. Montane spruce-fir-beech woodlands and subalpine spruce woodlands are predominant. Aposerido-Fagetum and Adenostylo-Piceetum are further divided into subassociations and variants. 18 site types were classified and mapped. The forest line, formed by Norway spruce (Picea abias), is situated at an altitude of about 1700m, but is widely depressed due to anthropogenic impact and edaphic factors. Forest use started in the Middle Ages and was initialized by the needs of neighbouring salterns and mining. This caused changes of the tree species composition (decrease of Silver fn, Abies alba) and humus dynamics. More recent impacts are caused by tourism, especially skiing, and cattle grazing in the forest.

AB  - Access to electric power and land are now key locational issues for the datacentre sector and most Nordic countries are pitching for their business. We use a comparative case analysis to illustrate several interrelated themes in Norway and Iceland, as both develop their datacentre sectors, but to date in differing ways. In both, digitalisation and datacentres are supported financially through equity holdings and securitisation issued via bespoke investment firms. For datacentres, this finance backs commoditised packages consisting of land with pre-approved planning permission; access to low-cost, reliable, renewable power; and a range of built infrastructure and computing options. Seeking to benefit from the development of monetised, dependent, regional Information Technology ecosystems, states assist with regulatory adjustments and municipalities with supportive land use zoning. Given the deeply entrained and multifaceted nature of the sector, we use our cases to highlight re-lationships between datacentre financing, spatial planning and infrastructure development in the two countries and also the ways in which the sector may take differing development trajectories. Overall, we build on the developing literature that is revealing the material realities of 'the cloud'.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate long-term effects of previous policies for energy efficiency on energy performance and heritage values. A further ambition is to better understand the relationship between energy and preservation by exploring a quantitative method of combining energy performance data with official heritage designation. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a quantitative analysis of energy performance, completed additional insulations, and official heritage classification for individual buildings. Data have been collected and analysed for a sample consisting of 289 multi-family buildings heated with district heating and constructed 1940-1949 in an urban area in Stockholm, Sweden. Findings - The data exhibit a significant correlation between the studied features. The study further shows that additional insulation has been installed in roughly half of the buildings. The large majority of them were carried out in the national programme for home improvement called ROT. Research limitations/implications - The findings indicate that previous policies for energy efficiency had an important effect on energy performance and heritage values in the studied area. They continue to affect urban planning and building permit administration today. Research of the physics of individual buildings would be needed in order to determine the reason for differences in the sample. Originality/value - By presenting a novel method, the study provides a useful tool for policy makers to bridge the gap between issues of energy and preservation and adopt a more holistic approach towards a sustainable built environment.

AB  - Public educational systems operate thousands of buildings with vastly different. characteristics in terms of size, age, location, construction, thermal behavior and user communities. Their strategic planning and sustainable operation is an extremely complex and requires quantitative evidence on the performance of buildings such as the interaction of indoor outdoor environment. Internet of Things (IoT) deployments can provide the necessary data to evaluate, redesign and eventually improve the organizational and managerial measures. In this work a data mining approach is presented to analyze the sensor data collected over a period of 2 years from an IoT infrastructure deployed over 18 school buildings spread in Greece, Italy and Sweden. The real-world evaluation indicates that data mining on sensor data can provide critical insights to building managers and custodial staff about ways to lower a buildings energy footprint through effectively managing building operations.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) causes large loss of free-ranging domestic sheep in Norway. We tested whether the observed higher kill rates by male lynx than female lynx were related to an association between the availability of the main natural prey, as measured by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) habitat suitability, presence of sheep, and habitat selection of male and female lynx. We found that lynx selected areas with high roe deer suitability during summer and winter. Moreover, during summer, compared to male lynx, females had greater selection for roe deer areas and a stronger avoidance for sheep grazing areas, which suggests that previously observed differences in kill rates between male and female lynx can be attributed to sex-specific habitat use during summer. The connection between lynx habitat use and roe deer also was reflected in a positive relationship between the roe deer suitability of a sheep grazing area and the total loss of lambs, which suggests that livestock, rather than being actively selected, are mainly killed by lynx incidentally when encountered during other lynx activities (e.g., searching for natural prey species). Therefore, any management practice that separates lynx and sheep, such as concentrating livestock into small patches or less preferred habitats, may reduce depredation.

AB  - Rising energy demand and global commitment to reduce carbon emission have led to increasing share of renewable energy in electricity generation mix, particularly hydropower. In line with the global trend, Malaysia has endeavored to develop hydropower and this was demonstrated in the proposal of 12 mega dams in one single Bornean state of Malaysia under the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy. Two of the dams are currently operational and one is at its early stage of construction. The mega dams have raised much doubt at their inception in view of the cumulative social and environmental impacts they could bring. Commissioning of two mega dams was immediately followed by establishment of energy-intensive plants sparking further need for energy. This article therefore aims to examine the energy supply and demand scenario and discuss the available energy options. These are achieved via desktop study and literature review. It points to a lack of planning in energy utilization in relation to the industrial expansion aspired, which gives rise to a reactive response to mounting energy demand without due consideration to other potential energy options. This contrasts the strategic energy planning practiced in developed nations and the socio-energy systems design advocated by some researchers. This article calls for consideration of natural gas, biomass residues and solar power as potential energy options as well as a strategic and participatory governance in hydropower expansion.

AB  - The use of strategic visions based on concepts like climate-neutrality, net-zero emissions and energy efficiency is important to align action and build momentum. The agency of transition actors requires clear definitions and explanations of visions, enabling operationalization for action, monitoring and measuring of results. This paper develops a maturity scale for climate-related strategic visions among local governments. Further, the maturity of Swedish municipalities' climate-related strategic visions is reviewed. The results show that out of Sweden's 290 municipalities, 256 shows overall low maturity in their strategic visions, not supporting their local, regional and national system actors sufficiently. Furthermore, results from workshops indicate that the roles, mandate and process for working with municipal strategic visions are not clear. There is an ambiguity around visions that is hindering aligned action and progress.

AB  - Population growth, the speed of urbanization in Asia and the more sophisticated requirements of the developed world have led to an increased demand for metals. Sweden is currently one of the EU's leading producers of ores and metals and major investments have been made regarding exploration. Although mining activities may be good for the local economy, mining can also have a negative impact both on the local environment and society which have generated a significantly increased stakeholder pressure over the last twenty years. As a consequence, the mining industry wants to be in fore front when it comes to practicing corporate social responsibility (CSR) in order to obtain the social license to operate (SLO). The concept SLO is based on the idea that mining companies need not only government permission (or permits) but also "social permission" to conduct their business. The social license consists of different parts, depending on the conditions in place. This paper is focusing on the Nordic mining industry and its stakeholders with the purpose to explore if CSR practice actually complies with stakeholder interests. This study, based on a content analysis of sustainability reports and a stakeholder survey, indicates that the CSR practice do comply to some extent with stakeholder interests but that there are room for improvement regarding the respect for laws and regulations, anti-corruption, sustainable resource use and energy in particular, sustainable land use, sustainable transports and the recycling of metals.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - While highly successful in terms of profitable seafood production, salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture may also be a source of potential negative environmental externalities. In an attempt to address these challenges through supporting the development of new technology, the Norwegian government has introduced a new class of aquaculture licenses labeled as development licenses. As a result, new technological solutions were proposed to reduce negative externalities through (1) expansion to open ocean areas not yet used for aquaculture and (2) reduced emissions from inshore production systems. This paper presents an analysis of the technological concepts proposed in applications for development licenses. The applications for development licenses provide a unique perspective on what technological directions existing marine aquaculture companies envisage that marine aquaculture may take in the future. The analysis indicates that units will become larger and stronger, as well as being specially designed to suit a variety of environments, creating a more heterogeneous industry. Large offshore structures such as semi-submersible platforms and other strong, rigid structures with permeable enclosures (nets) have been particularly successful in this application process, receiving relatively many development licenses. In sheltered fjord areas, many concepts involving closed enclosures (bags and tanks) have been suggested and awarded licenses.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an important method for the vegetative propagation of trees. SE is the developmental in vitro process in which embryos are produced from somatic cells. This method can be integrated with other biotechnological techniques, genomic breeding and cryopreservation, which enables commercial-scale sapling production of selected high-yielding genotypes in wood production combined with fast breeding cycles. The SE is potential tool to improve plant stock in comparison with seed orchards. It can be useful for ecologically and economically important species, such as Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), ensuring stable production in the era of climate change and biodiversity crisis. In this review, we summarize the current state of research on problems associated with somatic embryogenesis in P. abies and P. sylvestris.

AB  - Mowing is an important management method for species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe. Since mowing is costly, it is important to find a balance between mowing frequency and conservation benefits. We compared vegetation data from eleven field trials situated in southern Sweden that involved two mowing regimes, annually and every third year, as well as a no-management control. After approximately 14 years, mowing every third year showed (i) a drop in species richness and Shannon and GiniSimpson diversity indices, (ii) an increase in woody species, and (iii) increases in tall-grown species. However, there were no apparent changes in (iv) species that were indicative of poor management, nor (v) those indicating good management. For one of the trials, data after 38 years were also evaluated. Compared with annual mowing, there were strong negative changes in the number of species in the untreated control, while the results were conflicting for mowing every third year. In conclusion, the expected loss of conservation values from reduced mowing intensity was 5060% of the loss after abandonment. The outcomes, however, varied among the eleven sites.

AB  - Several studies have shown that Knowledge, Technologies, and Innovation play an important role in fostering a country's development. Education is the backbone for a sustainable and competitive economy. Although, the Balkans as a middle-income region has experienced growth since the late 1990s, the region is still facing many challenges. Norway, through the HERD program funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is providing support to make the Balkan economy more competitive by providing mechanisms facilitating knowledge and technology building. This paper reports the experience of five funded projects. Opportunities and challenges are discussed in order to develop a general framework facilitating the economic growth in Balkan countries.

AB  - There is an increased concern among many stakeholders in society that livestock production systems provide a low-quality life to the animals and therefore advocate improved farm animal welfare (FAW). On the other hand, producers are concerned that stricter welfare regulations would decrease their profits and hence their competitiveness. Given the relevance of the debate surrounding FAW especially in Sweden, and the lack of studies related to the beef sector, this study examined the impact of changes in FAW practices on economic performance of Swedish beef fattening operations. We modelled a herd of 50 cattle of either beef or dairy breed reared for meat production to examine the impact of increased space allowance, including a corresponding decrease in herd size, and increased forage-to-concentrate (FC) ratio. We found that a 1-m(2)/animal increase in space allowance was associated with a decrease of 18.9 and 10.8% in short-run, per animal profits in beef and dairy breeds, respectively. Sensitivity analysis suggested that an increase in weight gain and short-run loss in herd size due to increased space allowance were the most important factors. We estimated that an increase in the FC ratio from 40:60 to 65:35 was associated with a reduction in per animal profits of about 21 to 34% in beef breeds and 17 to 53% in dairy breeds, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that reduced growth due to increased FC ratio was the most important factor. Our results suggest that an increase in space allowance or FC ratio in Swedish beef fattening operations may reduce farm profitability. They also imply that consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully examined to reach the goal of improved FAW along with improved profitability and sustainability for the farmer.

AB  - The object of our study was to determine the effect of distribution and habitat specialization of odonate species on local extinction in streams in central Finland. We studied the local extinction of the 20 most abundant dragonfly (Odonata) species in 34 small creeks and brooks in central Finland. The historical presence of each studied species in our research area was confirmed using existing records gathered between 1930 and 1975. A minimum of five records was available for each species. During the summers of 1995 and 1996, we investigated the current persistence of 219 separate populations with historical presence. In total, 98 historical Populations were vanished. As predicted, we found that species with a narrow distribution were less persistent than species with a broad distribution. Therefore, the extinction risk of a species was inversely related to the width of its regional distribution. Using reference works, species were categorized into two main breeding habitat types: lotic species or lentic species. The species main habitat type was a significant predictor of local extinction risk after statistical removal of the effect of regional distribution on extinction risk. The lotic species had lower local extinction risk than other species. Altogether, the highest extinction risk was found in habitat-specialist species associated with peatlands, probably due to loss of natural breeding habitat. On the other hand, extinction risk was lower in widely distributed habitat generalist species than true lotic species. The local extinction within species was more common in small dynamic upstream than in larger stable downstream habitats. The results of this study are consistent with meta-population theory.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive will require river-basin management plans in order to achieve good ecological status and find the most cost-efficient nitrogen (N) leaching abatement measures. Detailed scenario calculations based on modeling methods will be valuable in this regard. This paper describes the approach and an application with a coefficient method based on the simulation model SOILNDB for quantification of N leaching from arable land and for prediction of the effect of abatement scenarios for the Ronnea catchment (1900 km(2)) in southern Sweden. Cost calculations for the different measures were also performed. The results indicate that the individual measures-cover crop and spring plowing, late termination of ley and fallow, and spring application of manure-would only reduce N leaching by between 5% and 8%. If all measures were combined and winter crops replaced by their corresponding spring variants, a 21% reduction in N leaching would be possible. However, this would require total fulfillment of the suggested measures.

AB  - This article explores how the conflict between the interests of protecting water quality in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea from nutrient emissions on one hand, and supporting blue growth in the aquaculture sector on the other, has played out in the Nordic legal systems and industry practice. It does so by reviewing the legal and industrial developments in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the gland Islands with a focus on interpretation and application of the common EU regulatory framework, mainly the Water Framework Directive and the ECJ Weser ruling, and the response from the aquaculture sector. The study shows that the four studied jurisdictions have taken disparate regulatory approaches in balancing ecological status of waters and blue growth. As a consequence of these legal developments, the aquaculture industry faces difficulty in attaining required permits for their operations in all four jurisdictions and significant uncertainty on how to develop the sector to meet the set growth objectives has arisen.

AB  - The subject of the present research is the assessment of access of residents of Northern cities to energy produced from renewable energy sources (RES). The largest Arctic cities in Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, the USA and Canada, located above 66 degrees 33 ' North latitude, are analysed. The importance of the study is due to the categorisation of access to RES as a fundamental good in the context of Sustainable Development Goals and fight against climate change. The work uses the index method, followed by ranking cities by the level of access to energy from RES. The following variables constitute the index: variety of operators, variety of types of energy sources, alternatives of energy sources, micro- and macro-generation support. It was found that residents of Kiruna and Tromso have the best access to energy from renewable sources due to the support of initiatives at all levels, while Utqiagvik has the lowest indicator due to its isolation. Energy from renewable energy sources does not have a significant share in all of the cities under consideration; moreover, the market is often monopolised, which limits the choice and availability of various energy sources. Consequently, it is important to create suitable conditions for developing of RES on all levels, with the focus on micro level (as it makes ordinary people participate actively in the agenda, which is the key to support such remote areas with energy); otherwise it is unlikely to support the cities and territories of the region with energy from RES.

AB  - Mining companies are facing various environmental and social challenges, ranging from ecological concerns to community relations issues. In Finland, mining companies have responded to these challenges by developing a sustainability initiative to increase their responsibility. This study is based on a questionnaire administered to senior mine managers to capture their views on the matter. This research argues that for successful implementation of the 'Towards Sustainable Mining Standard', organizations need certain leadership and management processes to support implementation. This research also argues that organizations need a set of sustainability initiatives to guide their operations towards improved environmental performance. This research shows that sustainability initiatives play an important role in mining companies' operations, and companies are committed to several initiatives in their businesses. Results show that top management commitment, adequate resource allocation, and a functioning management system with an emphasis on communication and stakeholder engagement are essential to support implementation.

AB  - Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.

AB  - Farming practice in the first period of the southern Scandinavian Neolithic (Early Neolithic I, Funnel Beaker Culture, 3950-3500 cal. BC) is not well understood. Despite the presence of the first farmers and their domesticated plants and animals, little evidence of profound changes to the landscape such as widespread deforestation has emerged from this crucial early period. Bone collagen dietary stable isotope ratios of wild herbivores from southern Scandinavia are here analysed in order to determine the expected range of dietary variation across the landscape. Coupled with previously published isotope data, differences in dietary variation between wild and domestic species indicate strong human influence on the choice and creation of feeding environments for cattle. In context with palynological and zooarchaeological data, we demonstrate that a human-built agricultural environment was present from the outset of farming in the region, and such a pattern is consistent with the process by which expansion agriculture moves into previously unfarmed regions.

AB  - There is a potential to utilize a significant amount of renewable energy in Sweden and European union (EU). Biomass can fulfil some 8500-12,500 TW h/y in EU, while the total utilization was 16,084 TW h/y 2009. Even though there is a significant amount of wind power, hydro power and potentially also solar power, it still is most economical to reduce the consumption of heat, electricity and fuels for vehicles. A saved kWh is normally cheaper than to produce one extra. In this paper different opportunities for saving energy will be discussed. This includes manufacturing industries, process industries, power plants and energy systems including distribution of power and smart grids, food production and transportation. There is also a major potential to save energy in buildings, both in the north where it is cold, and in the south where it can be very hot summer time. Here the potential is to avoid cooling instead. Technical solutions as well as economic incentives are covered. Environmental aspects are addressed, so that the solutions will be long term sustainable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil erosion causes environmental problems in the agriculture landscapes of southeast Norway (785 mm y(-1), 5.3 degrees C), especially on artificially levelled soils.
   Plot at five sites located within 60 km of Oslo mostly cultivated with small grain were used. They represented three soils: A) artificially levelled silty clay loam (3 sites); B) clay (1 site); and C) unlevelled loam with high aggregate stability (1 site). Mostly two of the used tillage systems are reported here: Pl-Au (ploughing in autumn, harrowing in spring), No-Au (no tillage in autumn).
   Winters could be cold, mild or variable. Due to the distribution of rainfall, evaporation and soil frost during the year, most of the surface runoff occurred during winter and early spring, but also in late autumn due to soil saturation by water.
   Average losses over 7 yr by Pl-Au were: 2700-6350 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) for soil type A, 1043 for type B and 158 for type C. With no tillage in autumn the following losses relative to ploughing autumn were 0.12, 0.2 and 0.66 respectively for A, B and C soils. Erosion risk was highest with autumn tillage, especially on soil A mostly due to the levelling effect.
   Infiltration capacity were greatest and erodibility lowest on soil type C. Infiltration capacity was less than 1 mm/h at saturation on soil type A causing surface runoff, even with moderate rainfall intensities.
   The empirical yet dynamic erosion model ERONOR simulated well the average soil losses for soil types and tillage systems over several years and also distributed surface runoff and soil losses throughout the year satisfactorily. The model does not handle processes on a large scale, but still it worked rather well in agricultural watersheds with no appreciable net losses due to large scale processes. The model can point out parcels with a high erosion risk within a watershed, and it can estimate the energy factor R in the Norwegian version of the USLE. The model predicts increased erosion in southeast Norway based on climate predictions of milder and rainier winters. (C)2007 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.

AB  - Loss of old-growth forests and greatly reduced volumes of coarse dead wood in managed forests are the main reasons for the decline of many wood-inhabiting species in Europe and elsewhere. To assess the habitat requirements and extinction vulnerability of 13 polypore species associated mainly with spruce, their occurrences were recorded on 96 521 dead-wood objects in 331 stands along a regional gradient of forest utilization history across southern-middle boreal Finland. The substrates studied included a variety of tree species and dead-wood qualities investigated in both unmanaged and managed stands at different successional stages. Hierarchical logistic regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships between the occurrence probability of individual species and variables at the substrate, stand and regional scales.

AB  - As a renewable fuel, logging residues, as well as other dendromass, are in high demand. On the other hand, they can serve as a natural fertilizer and stabilize biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Therefore, they need to be used rationally, with due care for the volumes extracted from a particular stand. The volume of logging residues is difficult to measure; thus, foresters need a tool to estimate it, ideally via a simple method based on easily measurable parameters. Conversion factors, based on tree stem volume can serve this purpose. In this study, we develop such conversion factors for thinnings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) stands. First, we analyzed the relationship between the tree stem volume (ranging between 0.03 and 0.44 m(3) stem(-1)) and the volumes of related logging residues or wood chips via linear regression and correlation analysis. Then, we assessed the significance of differences between volumes of logging residues or wood chips for trees in the five relevant stem volume classes and determined appropriate conversion factors. The conversion factors for wood chips ranged between 1.37 loose cubic meters of logging residue per cubic meter of timber in the largest stem volume class to 2.17 for the smallest stem volume class. The model, on which the conversion factors were based had a coefficient of determination of 0.88. Conversion to logging residue volume yielded factors ranging from 2.2 stacked cubic meters per cubic meter of timber for the largest stem volume class to 10.2 in the smallest stem volume class. The coefficient of determination of the underlying model was 0.69. The conversion factors are based on sufficiently accurate models and can be used in practical forestry for planning purposes, recordkeeping, and remuneration of loggers.

AB  - More attention has been given to tree size diversity in boreal forests over the past few years, mainly because of increased focus on uneven-aged forest management, biodiversity and social values. Objective measures of tree size diversity are needed in order to develop management plans that are sustainable with respect to ecological and economical values. The objective of the present study was to evaluate different indices describing diameter diversity based on criteria related to applications in forest management planning. Eight previously described indices were evaluated based on 16 simulated and 174 empirical diameter distributions. The Gini coefficient was found superior with respect to discriminant ability, capability of providing logical ranking of different distributions and sensitivity to variation in sample size. There is a wide range of possible applications of the Gini coefficient in forest management planning, e.g. to compare tree size diversity in different stands, to assess changes in tree size diversity over time, to quantify the influence of different silvicultural treatments on tree size diversity and to assess areas suitable for certain silvicultural treatments. The coefficient can also be used as an integrated part of growth simulators in order to control the silvicultural treatments in projections. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on an understanding of automation as various technological and organisational configurations in the making, this article aims to deepen insights into the governance arrangements shaping how automation is being introduced in public transport. Using a qualitative case study, we analyse the introduction of automated shuttle buses in Barkarbystaden, in the north-west of the Stockholm region, Sweden. Participant observation and qualitative interviews have been used to explore the governance arrangement forming automation in this case. We use planning literature on 'soft spaces' to discuss how automation emerges in connection to established processes and actors. Our findings show how the governance arrangement in this case transferred existing roles and responsibilities to the collaboration involving driverless shuttles, something which gives the bus operator a new and influential role in smart mobility in public transport. The article concludes with a discussion about the need to think critically about the ways in which roles, relations and responsibilities may be shaped and reshaped in collaborative governance arrangements around smart mobility, and to develop a more clearly articulated policy and planning agenda which clarifies the long-term public vision for automation in infrastructure and transport planning.

AB  - A century ago, overhunting had reduced Eurasian beaverCastor fiberpopulations to c. 1200 animals in scattered refugia from France to Mongolia. Reintroductions and natural spread have since restored the species to large areas of its original range. Population has more than tripled since the first modern estimate in 1998; the minimum estimate is now c. 1.5 million. Range expansion 2000-2020 has been rapid, with large extensions in western and south-central Europe, southern Russia, and west and central Siberia. Beavers are now re-established in all countries of their former European range except for Portugal, Italy, and the southern Balkans; they occur broadly across Siberia to Mongolia, with scattered populations father east. About half of the world population lives in Russia. Populations appear to be mature in much of European Russia, Belarus, the Baltic States, and Poland. There is a significant population of North American beaverCastor canadensisin Finland and north-west Russia. Most other 20th-Century introductions of this species have become extinct or been removed. Recent DNA studies have improved understanding ofCastor fiberpopulation prehistory and history. Two clades, east and west, are extant; a third 'Danube' clade is extinct. Refugial populations were strongly bottlenecked, with loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift. Future range extension, and large increases in populations and in impacts on freshwater systems, can be expected. Beavers are now recolonising densely populated, intensely modified, low-relief regions, such as England, the Netherlands, Belgium, and north-west Germany. They will become much more common and widespread there in coming decades. As beavers are ecosystem engineers with profound effects on riparian habitats, attention to integrating beaver management into these landscapes using experience gained in other areas - before the rapid increase in population densities and impacts occurs - is recommended.

AB  - After decoupling EU income support, normal Swedish systems for suckler cow-based beef production are unable to pay the costs of new investments and market wages for labour. New production systems, able to achieve full cost coverage, were identified by an expert panel. The two most profitable suggestions can be characterized as 'organic with high environmental grants and premium price for beef' and 'conventional with outdoor wintering of cows'. Both systems presuppose the availability of large areas of semi-natural pasture per cow and larger herd sizes than are now common in Sweden. Breeding progress and other biological improvements could only marginally improve the profitability.

LA  - English
AB  - This paper is concerned with the case of the pre-war (1917-1939) Finnish Orthodox Church, and places emphasis on the political, cultural and ideological representation and rhetoric of the religious landscapes and milieux of Orthodox culture. It studies how the political symbolism of the Orthodox religious culture was seen by the dominant Lutheran culture either as an alien intrusion, and thus inappropriate, or as an acceptable national value, depending on the location of the landscape in question. The examples of this variation in the political reading of religious landscapes are taken from pre-war newspapers dealing with the Russian military churches of southern Finland, the chapels of the border region of Karelia and the nationalist values attached to Valamo Monastery.

AB  - Movik, S. & Stokke, K.B. 2015. Contested knowledges, contested responsibilities: The EU Water Framework Directive and salmon farming in Norway. Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift-Norwegian Journal of Geography Vol. 00, 00-00. ISSN 0029-1951Norway has signed the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD), according to which all water bodies are expected to have good ecological status' by 2021. An ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of aquaculture is related particularly to the impact on wild salmon of the spread of salmon lice and escaped farmed fish. The authors examine the key arguments concerning the environmental impact of salmon farming, and how knowledge is produced and marshalled in the dispute. How does the framing of knowledge and authority affect the apportioning of responsibility for taking appropriate measures to mitigate negative effects? The questions are addressed by drawing on insights from critical political ecology and work on governance scales, and by analysing relevant documents and grey' literature in combination with in-depth, semi-structured interviews with key actors. The authors find that there are biases within the research environments that tend to reinforce existing divisions between the environmental authorities and fisheries authorities. Disagreements about the appropriate scientific approaches to assessing sustainability are a barrier to co-operation and planning, and the consensus needed to implement appropriate measures will depend on clarification at the national level.

AB  - Overhunting reduced Eurasian Beaver (Castor fiber) populations to c. 1200 animals, in eight isolated populations, around the end of the 19th century. Protection, natural spread and reintroductions led to a powerful recovery in both range and populations during the 20th century, which continues at a rapid pace. The minimum population estimate is 593 000. There are also c . 12 500 North American Beaver (C. canadensis) established in Finland and Russian Karelia; however, other populations of C. canadensis introduced in Austria, Poland and France ap-pear to be extinct. Castor fiber is now established throughout Europe with the exception of the British Isles, Iberia, Italy and the southern Balkans; reintroductions are continuing. Considerable further expansion in range and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin, can be expected. If current trends continue, C. fiber will, within a few decades, be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe. Following initial recolonization, populations typically show a pattern of rapid range extension within a watershed, followed only later by rapid population growth, and a barrier effect of watershed divides, which can be strongly isolating where physical or habitat barriers (such as mountains or intensive farmland) intrude between watersheds. Management of beaver distribution should therefore operate at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant bar-riers to spread. The period of rapid population increase, if unchecked, leads to a phase of population decline as marginal habitats are occupied and exhausted. This coincides with a peak in conflicts with human land-use interests. A regulated hunting take of healthy beaver populations is recommended as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities has been a feature of several recent reintroductions. This provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers.

AB  - Nest predation in ground nesting black grouse (Tetra tetrix) inhabiting managed boreal forests is arguably the single most important cause of nesting failure. Little is known, however, about indirect effects of other factors, such as maternal or environmental properties, and to what extent maternal and habitat qualities interact with varying levels of predator densities. Using an information-theoretical approach, we studied maternal and environmental determinants of daily nest survival rates under variable predator densities of 210 individual black grouse hens in central Finland. Environmental determinants were far more important than maternal ones, and the effects were more apparent at higher predator densities. Keeping predator densities constant, daily nest survival rates increased with nest conspicuousness and increasing tree density, and were higher in undrained areas. While there was no difference between adults and juveniles, hens that invested more in egg size were more successful. Therefore, environmental factors and, to a lesser extent, maternal properties, indirectly affect nesting success especially when predator density is high. Modern forestry practices such as clear cutting and drainage are commonly linked to increased densities of predators such as foxes. Our results suggest that the nesting success of black grouse may further be indirectly affected by the same practices, the overall impact being a balance between the negative (e.g. drainage, clear-cutting) and the positive (reforestation, producing dense young forest stands) effects.

AB  - Regional variations in the concentrations of DOM were studied in running waters in central-northern Sweden. The highest concentrations occurred in the coastal areas, and there was a marked trend with decreasing concentrations towards the inland and the mountain range further west. Explanation of these differences are regional differences in forestland productivity, the occurrence and type of peatlands, annual runoff patterns and soil drainage conditions. Anthropogenic factors, such as atmospheric deposition of acids and forestry, have probably not contributed to the regional differences.

AB  - We have conducted a reflection seismic investigation over the apatite-iron deposit at Grangesberg in central Sweden. At the time of closure in 1989, the mine was operated using the sublevel caving method down to approximately a 650-m depth. This mining technique caused subsidence and generated a network of faults that propagated from excavated zones at depth up to the surface. The Grangesberg deposit is the largest iron oxide mineralization in central Sweden and is planned to be mined again in the coming years. It is therefore imperative to have a better understanding of the ore geometry and the fault network. A reconnaissance survey consisting of two seismic lines with a total length of 3.5 km was carried out to address these issues. The profiles intersect the Grangesberg deposit and open pit, as well as the major mining-induced fracture zone present in this area. A drop-hammer source mounted on a hydraulic truck was used to generate seismic signals; cabled and wireless receivers were used for the data recording. Preprocessing of the data first required the cable-and wirelessrecorded data sets to be merged before stacking all data available at each shot point. Source gathers exhibit reflections from the near surface, probably generated at lithological boundaries hosting the iron mineralization and other geologic structures. Deeper reflections were also observed. The metavolcanic assemblage hosting the mineralization and the anthropogenic fault network were depicted in the stacked sections, bringing in new elements to refine the geologic model of the area. This study also illustrated the ability of reflection seismic methods to delineate mining-induced structures in hard-rock environments. Low-velocity anomalies from the open pit and adjacent structures were depicted in tomographic sections along the two lines, which showed good agreement with known geologic features and the reflection seismic results.

AB  - Restoration schemes often rely on the assumption that enhancing habitat complexity through addition of in-stream structures such as boulders and woody debris leads to increased biodiversity, but evidence for this assumption is. scarce. We compared structural heterogeneity and fish and invertebrate diversity at restored, unrestored, and reference sites on tributaries of the Ume River, northern Sweden, where several kilometers of streams have been restored from channelization through placement of boulders into the channel. Structural heterogeneity at the study sites was assessed using a contour tracer at two spatial resolutions likely to be affected by restoration. These are the patch scale (0.7 in), reflecting substratum characteristics, and the reach scale (50 in), reflecting general channel topography. Fish and invertebrate samples collected via electroshocking were used to assess taxonomic richness, taxonomic density, evenness, and assemblage composition at the study sites. Measures of structural heterogeneity were substantially higher at restored relative to channelized sites; however, components of fish and invertebrate diversity were similar between these treatments. At restored sites, measures of structural heterogeneity and fish and invertebrate diversity Were consistent with, or slightly exceeded reference levels. This implies that local (patch to reach) heterogeneity did not structure fish and invertebrate assemblages in the study streams. Our results suggest that restoration might have little beneficial effect on biodiversity if the restoration schemes (and the original impact under amelioration) do not affect structural heterogeneity relevant to the target organisms.

AB  - As twin sister concepts in urban planning, "car-free city" and "city of short walks" are usually combined and successfully implemented in Europe, for example in Vauban (Freiburg, Germany) and in Hammarby Sjostad (Stockholm, Sweden). In these two pilot projects, clean environment, safe traffic flows and convenient services as three essential criteria for a good living quality as well as three key indices of sustainability have been secured. A number of conditions necessary for the establishment of the two new planning concepts in Hanoi should be analysed with an emphasis on mobility and logistics. Additionally, public participation needs to be discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Retaining forest patches at final harvest is a key conservation measure in boreal forests, but guidelines for how to increase its cost-effectiveness are lacking. In a study in boreal Sweden, we compared the cost-effectiveness of three different approaches a forest owner may use to select patches: selection based on the conservation value of patches alone, economic cost alone or both of them combined. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of six different common types of patches. Conservation value was measured as species richness of bryophytes and lichens and as structural characteristics of patches. Compared to the selection approach in which both conservation value and cost were used, cost-effectiveness was 5-14% lower when only conservation value was used, depending on how conservation value was measured. On the contrary, using only the economic cost decreased the cost-effectiveness by only 1-2%. Among the patch types, swamp forest areas and deciduous tree groups were cost-effective types to retain. However, the patch types were complementary in their species composition and all hosted unique species. We argue that, ideally, assessments of both conservation values and economic costs of retaining patches should be made prior to harvest to enable planners to make well-informed and cost-effective decisions.

AB  - This paper discusses how physical planning works with place-making through urban design to support image creation in a municipality that aims to create a new image for its city. Two large-scale urban development projects in Sweden are analysed. The analysis focuses on official plans and documentation, and expert interviews. It distinguishes how place-making by physical planning happens through aestheticisation, the design of physical environments for specific groups of inhabitants and by granting visual and symbolic coherence to an area aligned with the new image for the city. The construction of this image is kick-started by a flagship development, but requires that subsequent projects support complementing urban visions, so as to grant coherence to the perceptions of the new image. In the process, heterogeneity, variation and conflict are tamed and urbanity is framed for "creative classes". The paper thus highlights potential dilemmas that place-making might create for the practice of physical planning in urban development and contributes to the discussions on the transformation of public sector urban planning in the context of urban entrepreneurialism.

AB  - We examined responses of Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) to edges between nesting habitat (mature spruce forests), movement habitat (other forests, pine bogs), and open areas within their home ranges in southern Finland in 1996-2000. Radio-tracked squirrels (n = 146) were generally associated to edges when they were active at night. Compared to distances expected from the habitat pattern of their home range, squirrels occurred closer to high-contrast edges (of open areas) and low-contrast edges (nesting or movement forest types). Association with edges of open areas was more pronounced when squirrels were in movement habitat than in nesting habitat, possibly because of stronger channeling of movements in the former habitat. When in nesting habitat, squirrels responded more strongly to field edges than to recent clearcut edges, probably as a result of the presence of more deciduous trees on field edges, unlike clearcut edges. Responses to open areas were independent of spatial scale. However, responses to movement habitat from nesting habitat, and vice versa, were more pronounced over hundreds than tens of meters. Nesting cavities and dreys were generally located at random with respect to edges. We conclude that squirrel responses to edges of landscape attributes are diverse and depend both on spatial scale and edge contrast.

AB  - Cross-border innovation cooperation (CBIC) has been heralded as one of the corner stones of innovation-driven growth opportunities for firms located in cross-border regions (CBRs). The success of this cooperation is affected by varying types of proximities identified in the literature as geographical, institutional, cultural, cognitive, technological, organizational and social. Although the topic has been widely discussed, the validation of the concept of proximity vis-a-vis CBIC has been persistently hindered by a lack of readily available empirical metrics. Therefore, this research note attempts to operationalize the varying types of proximity - in relation to CBIC - in the form of a questionnaire tested through pilot studies of two CBRs, at the Finnish-Swedish and Danish-German border, and for two contrasting service industries, namely knowledge-intensive business services and tourism. The findings indicate that the developed survey metrics are effective in depicting the phenomenon of proximity. The foundational work undertaken in this research note provides a platform, and catalyst, for more extensive investigations of the topic.

AB  - In less than 50 years Atlantic salmon farming has become a major industry in Norway, and several attempts at predicting future growth have been made. In all food production, genetics has played an important role in production optimisation and efficiency. The benefits of genetic selection in aquaculture are less documented due to a variable production environment, long production time and challenges such as sea-lice, infectious diseases, and market fluctuations. This study investigates the impact of 50 years of balanced genetic selection on growth and productivity of the Norwegian Atlantic salmon industry. In a common garden experiment eggs from females representing present-day farmed Atlantic salmon (generation 11), were fertilised with cryo-preserved milt from males representing previous generations, and the progeny (half-sib families) were reared under the same commercial farming conditions. At the termination of this experiment, the difference in average body weight between generation 0 and half-sibs from present-day salmon was 1.5 kg. The results from the common garden experiment were used to model the contribution of genetic selection for increased salmon growth rate to the industry from generation 0 (harvested in 1975-1978) to generation 11 (harvested in 2017 - 2019) and to simulate the power of genetics for expected industry growth until 2050 (generation 24) giving four different forecast scenarios. We found that a total Norwegian production of 2.5 to 3.2 million tonnes could be achieved in 2050 solely by improving the inherent growth potential of Atlantic salmon through genetic selection. Further, the production time in seawater is expected to be reduced by 40 to 53% from 15.3 months in 2019 to a production time ranging from 9.2 to 7.2 months in 2050, respectively. Reduced production time in seawater results in reduced time at risk of diseases and other unfortunate events, and in our most progressive scenario, mortality in seawater was expected to be reduced by up to 50%. The contribution to reduced losses and increased resource utilisation, increases the sustainability of the Norwegian aquaculture industry. This study demonstrated that it is possible to significantly increase the Norwegian aquaculture production by genetic improvement, and that contribution from genetic selection for growth rate alone can close 77% of the gap of the forecasted five million tonnes in 2050. These scenarios demonstrate that genetic selection should be included as a central component when predicting future development and growth of aquaculture production, both in Norway and other salmon producing countries.

AB  - Nutrient management is one of the critical challenges for developing sustainable circular economies in cities. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from our food end up in our wastewater and pose an environmental threat when they are released in waterways. Yet, these nutrients are essential for crop production and food security. Hince human excreta contains the bulk of nutrients going through the urban ecosystem. Source separation of excreta from the rest of urban wastewater flows can enable safe and efficient nutrient recovery. Yet, source-separating wastewater systems are not yet common in urban areas. The aim of this study is to assess the legitimacy of source-separating wastewater systems from the perspective of wastewater professionals in Sweden. The study uses interviews and a survey to explore the pragmatic, normative, cognitive and regulatory dimensions of legitimacy and how these aspects can vary between different municipalities. Finally, it looks into possible knowledge-based activities to increase legitimacy. The results from this study show variations in legitimacy levels in urban areas in Sweden. Overall opinion appears to be neutral to the concept rather than negative. Although many see multiple barriers to implementation. Normative legitimacy (moral motivation) was relatively high, while cognitive legitimacy (knowledge & experiences) was lowest. Respondents from organizations where source-separation is being implemented, or they believe that it will be implemented within 10 years, generally saw more drivers and fewer barriers. These innovators were also more interested in knowledge-based activities. Overall recommendations to increase cognitive knowledge regarding source-separating systems among multiple stakeholders seems the most promising path forward to increase legitimacy in the Swedish wastewater sector.

AB  - With global warming, arable land in boreal regions is tending to expand into high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere. This entails certain risks; such that inappropriate management could result in previously stable carbon sinks becoming sources. Agroecological models are an important tool for assessing the sustainability of long-term management, yet applications of such models in boreal zones are scarce. We collated eddy-covariance, soil climate and biomass data to evaluate the simulation of GHG emissions from grassland in eastern Finland using the process-based model DNDC. We simulated gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) with fair performance. Soil climate, soil temperature and soil moisture at 5 cm were excellent, and soil moisture at 20 cm was good. However, the model overestimated NEE and Reco following crop termination and tillage events. These results indicate that DNDC can satisfactorily simulate GHG fluxes in a boreal grassland setting, but further work is needed, particularly in simulated second biomass cuts, the (>20 cm) soil layers and model response to management transitions between crop types, cultivation, and land use change.

AB  - To date, studies that provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the cottage in Finland are lacking in the literature. This paper explored this phenomenon, which has great cultural and economic importance for Finland, through interviews from the perspective of experts. Key findings based on main themes including cottage buyers, characteristics of the dream cottage, diversified cottages, the regulation of cottages in municipalities, and challenges in the regulation of cottages, highlighted that: (1) cottage buyers were reported to be mostly in their 50s and wealthy; (2) buyers were in high demand for easy solutions and cottages with a similar level of equipment to a primary home; (3) environmental issues were considered interesting, but buyers primarily paid attention to the cleanliness of the nature and especially the body of water surrounding their cottage; (4) distance to the cottage and closest services were deciding factors, and there was greater demand for waterfront cottages; (5) popular cottage sizes varied widely, and the diversification was among the highlights; (6) while changes in use were possible under certain circumstances, sewage and wastewater regulation, and sizing of beach construction were considered challenging. It is believed that this paper will contribute to the balanced territorial development of cottages in Finland and the vitality of cottage-rich municipalities.

AB  - In this article we explore the fate of high modernist architecture and settlement planning in the North, through the lens of mining towns in Sweden and Quebec. After WW2, cities across the world were subject to a wave of restructuring in accordance with high modernist ideals. The circumpolar north became the subject of some of the most radical examples, often described as utopian. In the Swedish Arctic, a renowned architect Ralph Erskine played a leading role. He combined functionalist principles, with ideas of creating settlements protecting in-habitants from harsh Arctic conditions, in harmony with the environment. Erskine...s ideas were implemented to a different extent in Kiruna and Svappavaara in north Sweden in the 1960's and in Fermont, Quebec, in the early 1970...s. Our aim is to understand the challenges of creating industrial settlements in the Arctic, with the ca-pacity to attract employees that are needed for resource extraction and other industries. While Erskine's ar-chitecture in Svappavaara and Kiruna will be demolished, the wall shaped town in Fermont is still intact and expanding. By comparing and highlighting differences, we call attention to the threat of demolition of legacies of an era that has yet to be defined as cultural heritage.

AB  - Do people classify nature in ways that can be described as archetypes? Could it be that these can be interpreted as health promotive? More and more researchers today suggest that archetypes can be used to analyze, describe, and develop green spaces. In parallel, an increasing number of research results since the 1980s have shown that human health and well-being are positively affected by stays in certain nature areas. The qualities in these nature areas which stand out to be most health-promoting are interpreted to be properties of nature that humans through evolution are prepared to perceive in a positive way. In this study, 547 respondents in southern Sweden answered a questionnaire on properties in natural areas. Through cluster analysis, these properties have been grouped into 10 types of nature and landscape. The 10 clusters are related to specific phenomena and places in Scandinavian nature, which could be described as archetypal. These natural phenomena and places are discussed, partly based on references to archaic Scandinavian mythology, Scandinavian lifestyle, and cultural canon, and partly on research on evolution, human preferences, and how nature can affect human health. We discuss how these nature archetypes evoke anxiety, fear, and distancing as well as calmness, tranquility, and connection. However, researchers have so far focused on how visits to natural environments have affected the sympathetic nervous system, and not realized the possibility of including the calm and connection system as well as the oxytocin in their explanatory models. In a follow-up article, we intend to develop a model for how the nature archetypes can interact with the calm and connection system.

AB  - The Social License to Operate (SLO) continues to influence industry, government, and academia on issues of resource development, particularly mining. But it risks becoming a term that includes all types of company activity aimed at gaining public support. To delimit the term, we look at the malleability of the SLO in a highly regulated context: Sweden. Comparing the academic literature on the SLO at the global level and in the Swedish context, we assess the usefulness of the term across three themes: institutions, corporate-community engagement, and sustainability. Through this review, we argue that the SLO is best understood as a tool and an indicator. A tool to address significant problems and issues and an indicator of deficiencies in the existing institutional framework

AB  - The pollen composition of the uppermost part of sediments formed during the last hundred years in four lakes located in different landscapes (open agricultural land, forested area, ombrotrophic bog) in Estonia was studied. The pollen of land-use indicator taxa are arranged into three groups: indicators of cultivated lands ruderal communities, and meadow and pasture land. We established clear differences in the pollen proportions of cultivated, ruderal and meadow plants,,depending on the intensity of human impact around studied site. The temporal changes of the share of different human impact pollen indicators show especially good correlation with the history. of land-use when the changes took place in the immediate, vicinity of the lake (Ruusmae). In those areas close to the actively used arable land the proportion of Cerealia pollen may reach 6%-8% of the total pollen sum. Values of Cerealia pollen of 1%-2% reflect the background values for the region.

AB  - Diversity patterns and dynamics at forest edges are not well understood. We disentangle the relative importance of edge-effect variables on spatio-temporal patterns in species richness and occupancy of deadwood-dwelling fungi in fragmented old-growth forests. We related richness and log occupancy by 10 old-growth forest indicator fungi and by two common fungi to log conditions in natural and anthropogenic edge habitats of 31 old-growth Picea abies forest stands in central Sweden. We compared edge-to-interior gradients (100 m) to the forest interior (beyond 100 m), and we analyzed stand-level changes after 10 yr. Both richness and occupancy of logs by indicator species was negatively related to adjacent young clear-cut edges, but this effect decreased with increasing clear-cut age. The occupancy of logs by indicator species also increased with increasing distance to the natural edges. In contrast, the occupancy of logs by common species was positively related or unrelated to distance to clear-cut edges regardless of the edge age, and this was partly explained by fungal specificity to substrate quality. Stand-level mean richness and mean occupancy of logs did not change for indicator or common species over a decade. By illustrating the importance of spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects, we extend the general understanding of the distribution and diversity of substrate-confined fungi in fragmented old-growth forests. Our results highlight the importance of longer forest rotation times adjacent to small protected areas and forest set-asides, where it may take more than 50 yr for indicator species richness levels to recover to occupancy levels observed in the forest interior. Also, non-simultaneous clear-cutting of surrounding productive forests in a way that reduces the edge effect over time (i.e., dynamic buffers) may increase the effective core area of small forest set-asides and improve their performance on protecting species of special concern for conservation.

AB  - Can small and isolated high-conservation value forests (e.g. designated woodland key habitats) maintain old-growth forest characteristics and functionality in fragmented landscapes? To what extent have past disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) influenced the development of old-growth characteristics of these forests? How long does it take for selectively cut stands to attain conditions resembling old-growth forests?
   Southern boreal zone of central Sweden.
   We linked multiple lines of evidence from historical records, biological archives, and analyses of current forest structure to reconstruct the forest history of a boreal landscape, with special emphasis on six remaining core localities of high-conservation value forest stands.
   Our reconstructions revealed that several of these stands experienced wildfires up to the 1890s; all had been selectively harvested in the late 1800s; and all underwent substantial structural and compositional reorganization over the following 100-150 years. This time interval was sufficient to recover considerable amounts of standing and downed dead wood (mean 60.3 m(3) ha(-1)), a range of tree ages and sizes (mean basal area 32.6 m(2) ha(-1)), and dominance of shade-tolerant spruce. It was insufficient to obtain clearly uneven tree age structures and large (> 45 cm diameter) living and dead trees. Thus, these forests contain some, but not all, important compositional and structural attributes of old-growth forests, their abundance being dependent on the timing and magnitude of past natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Our landscape-level analysis showed marked compositional and structural differences between the historical forest landscape and the present landscape, with the latter having a greater proportion of young forests, introduction of non-native species, and lack of large trees and dead wood.
   The remnant high-conservation value stands were not true representatives of the pre-industrial forests, but represent the last vestige of forests that have regenerated naturally and maintained a continuous tree cover. These traits, coupled with their capacity for old-growth recovery, make them valuable focal areas for conservation.

AB  - Land-use change was the main source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions until the mid-twentieth century, especially due to deforestation processes. In recent decades, however, CO2 sequestration is being induced in some countries where forest area is experiencing net increases. Despite the key role of these processes, we hardly dispose of any empirical evidence of historical changes in biomass stocks, especially in the long-term (over 50 years) and in cultivated areas. In this study, we quantify the evolution of the surface area, carbon stocks (C) and C density of living biomass in Spain (50 provinces) between 1860 and 2010. According to our results, the C stock fell from 340.3 Tg C to 254.2 Tg C between 1860 and 1950, to then reach 844.0 Tg C in 2010. Although the stock began to increase much later than in other European countries, annual growth rates were much more significant. A decomposition analysis allowed us to observe that the increase in stock was mainly due to the change in C density (61.2% of the effect), surface area (35.3%) and, to a lesser extent, to the effect of location in more productive areas (5.7%). Woody crops - which were historically managed as agroforestry systems when combined with other crops - stored 15.8% of total stocks during the period studied. They play a particularly important role in areas with a Mediterranean climate because in these provinces, crops such as olive groves, vineyards or oranges have proliferated. The reasons for C stock increases are: the substitution of firewood with fossil fuels; agricultural intensification; and the outsourcing of land use to other countries through agricultural imports.

AB  - Transition from the current oil-based world economy to an economy based on renewable resources can become a strong driving force for land use change. This paper describes the development of integrated explorative and normative scenarios for the analysis of future land use in a climate-neutral Sweden. The aim is to show how backcasting scenarios fulfilling far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets can be related to assumptions on possible external developments, in order to contribute to the discussion on future sustainable land use. A target-fulfilling scenario element was combined with an external scenario element, i.e. developments that cannot be influenced by the targeted actors. The scenarios were developed and analysed in collaboration with local actors. Four scenarios were used to describe how land in Sweden could be used when Sweden has achieved zero emissions of greenhouse gases in 2060. The explorative dimension stretched from a situation where there is no international climate agreement to one where there is an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gases. The backcasting dimension illustrated different strategies to achieve the target and stretches from a very influential municipal level to one where the national/EU level is most influential.

AB  - The EU's energy sector depends heavily on fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change. This is why climate mitigation targets for energy production have been set, including an increased biomass use requirement. In Finland, biomass is commonly utilised but its capital, Helsinki, is still dependent on fossil fuels. With the ambition of becoming climate neutral by 2050, Helsinki is testing, inter alia, low-share wood pellet and coal co-combustion in a CHP (combined heat and power) plant.
   The objectives of this paper were to assess the net environmental impacts of the co-combustion and changes in urban air quality connected to pellet transport, and to identify environmental hotspots relevant to possible future higher-share co-combustion. The applied methods were screening LCA (life cycle assessment) and fine particle dispersion modelling.
   The results prove that low-share wood pellet co-combustion in CHP production leads to net environmental impact reductions and does not deteriorate air quality in the urban environment. If higher-share co-combustion were to be implemented, the environmental hotspots to focus on would be the operational issues of a power plant and the origin and sustainability aspects of wood pellet production.

AB  - The study focuses on structural and compositional dynamics of high-elevation (boreal) mixed Picea-Betula forest in the Swedish Scandes. Data from seven years' monitoring of crown condition (defoliation), seed viability, soil and air temperatures, a tree-ring chronology and the age structure of Picea are presented. Real long-term dynamism of the tree cover was inferred from radiocarbon dates of buried subfossil wood. At all time-scales, the forest has responded sensitively to thermal variability. Picea seed viability, demography and radial growth correlated positively with summer temperature. The current Picea population largely results from warming during the first half of the 20th century. However, cooler climate in the past c. five decades has led to reduced population and radial growth as well as accelerating crown defoliation. This decline is related primarily to winter soil temperatures. The mechanism of needle loss is deduced to be winter desiccation and resulting cavitation of the xylem. It is hypothesized that previous similar episodes have been balanced by periods of spruce expansion. The successional history leading up to the present stage includes fire disturbance and subsequent cooling during the Little Ice Age, which prolonged and consolidated the early post-fire Betula phase. Pinus was incapable of penetrating these unusually dense birch stands, whereas the shade-intolerant spruce could establish progressively as climate warmed. This course of structural and compositional dynamism relates to complex interactions of disturbance, climate change and reproductive responses.

AB  - Finland is currently undergoing a fundamental structural transformation in the forestry sector, with factories closing in the Global North and production being shifted to the Global South (see also Carrere & Lohmann 1996; Cossalter & Pye-Smith 2003). This is accompanied by Finnish mass movements protesting unemployment and demanding corporate social responsibility (CSR) from the forest industry. The difficult domestic situation, however, seems to overshadow the circumstances of the new production regions in the South. What do we actually know about the impacts of the Finnish forestry sector in those societies? The branches of global forest companies may be located in regions that are experiencing various societal conflicts - like in the case of indigenous communities in northeastern Brazil, where the question of land ownership remains unsolved. The aim of our paper is to bring out the perspective of these traditional communities and the legitimacy problems of the Finnish forest industry in Brazil. We also scrutinize the corporate tactics by which companies seek to gain societal acceptability in the region. These range from social programs and campaigns to violent confrontations, even to attempts to deconstruct the identities of indigenous communities. Our general argument is that while companies have outlined their CSR policies in theory, the situation in actual practice is quite different. Companies often fail to take into account the prevailing socioeconomic conditions in the region and some of the more marginal stakeholders like indigenous peoples, who obviously have no economic importance to the company.

AB  - Globally human pressure on the biosphere is increasing, in spite of increases in land use efficiency. The pressure consists of land use and potential degradation. Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) is emerging as an indicator, which combines the dual aspects of biomass use and land degradation. Recently HANPP has been used to map the increasing dependence of European countries on biomass imports and the conflicting processes of increased yields and increased consumption. However large overview studies could be complemented with indepth analysis into the causes of changes in individual countries and economic sectors. This allows the analysis of the macroeconomic drivers of change and the responses in sectors to these drivers. In this study we decomposed the HANPP of Finland including imports for the years 2000-2010 using IPAT and applied input-output analysis to look at sectoral land use efficiency in that time period. Finland is a country with intensive biomass trade, and with a very high per capita HANPP. During the study period the sum of domestic and embodied in imports HANPP of the Finnish economy decreased from 76 Mt C/a to 62 Mt C/a (-1% annually on average), while the HANPP related to imports increased from 12 Mt C/a to 14 Mt C/a. The overall trend was that of declining exports and increasing domestic consumption. Of the economic sectors wood harvesting and processing dominated HANPP results, followed by residential construction, animal production and energy supply. In terms of HANPP, most of these decreased, but housing and energy production increased considerably from 2002 to 2010. At the macroeconomic level domestic biomass use per unit of value added decreased (-2.2%/a) as did the amount of HANPP per unit of biomass (-1.1%/a) reflecting increased economic efficiency in land use. In contrast, GDP/capita (+1.3%/a), population (+0.4%) and the share of outsourced HANPP (+0.6%) resulted in increased consumption-based HANPP (from 21 Mt C in 2002 to 27 Mt C in 2010). Our results underline the importance of including international trade and consumption in interpreting overall change in regional HANPP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been the most mediatised health crisis in human history, involving a rapid circulation of knowledge in global networks and a continuous flow of spectacular images and narratives that have rendered the pandemic graspable in cultural, political, and moral terms. This article proposes that the intertwined nature of two opposite trends of knowledge production - scientific reasoning and affective storytelling - can be analytically approached through the concept of 'outformation' that provides explanatory power and conceptual clarity to make sense of the disorderly flows of knowledge in the pandemic-era. Using frame analysis, the article examines how one key term of the pandemic era, herd immunity, is taken from its scientific context and mobilised across different epistemic arenas from journalistic media to parliamentary debates as a vehicle for mistrust towards political and expert authorities in Finland that is a country characterised by high levels of trust towards authorities. The Finnish case is not only a national case about the framing of a specific term in times of epistemic instability but also provides a valuable lens to knowledge production during the pandemic era.

AB  - Current knowledge of patterns and abundance of deciduous trees in the pre-industrial landscape of boreal Sweden is limited. This is due to a dramatic transformation of the forest landscape during the last 100 years and the lack of representative forest reserves. We used historical records to study change in five mixed deciduous forests between 1866 and 1999. The results show that large changes occurred due to complex interactions between fire disturbance, fire suppression, logging and silviculture. Before fire suppression, the presence of deciduous trees was mainly determined by earlier fire influence. Later selective logging disturbed natural succession and favoured regeneration of deciduous trees. During the 20(th) century deciduous trees were removed by girdling, thinning and herbicide spraying. Much of the mixed deciduous stands changed to coniferous stands between 1906-15 and 1969-70, and then deciduous trees were totally removed from these stands between late 1960s and 1999. Today mixed deciduous forest occurs mainly in young stands and on other sites than previously. Our results also show that large coniferous trees and multi-aged forest occurred in all sites in the early 1900s. Most sites were dominated by coniferous species and forest dominated by deciduous trees occurred only in smaller areas. These results are not consistent with the current view that deciduous-dominated forest occupied substantial areas in boreal Sweden before fire suppression. Appropriate changes in forest management are discussed, as is the value of historical data in interpreting changes in forest landscapes.

AB  - Ducks are important game species, hunted in several countries throughout their annual cycle. We investigated whether the size of the annual duck harvest in Finland and Denmark reflected annual reproductive output in three common quarry duck species. Finland represents an important breeding area and Denmark important staging/wintering grounds for common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Mareca penelope) and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula). We assessed whether (i) annual duck harvest in these two countries correlated with variation in Finnish reproductive output or adult population size during 1990-2016 and (ii) variation in reproductive output of Finnish ducks was reflected in the juvenile ratios of birds harvested in Finland (2005-2007, 2014-2016) or Denmark (1990-2016). We hypothesised that variation in Finnish reproductive output would positively affect the size and juvenile ratio of the harvest, and that this effect would be stronger closer to the breeding grounds. Our data showed that the annual harvest of goldeneye in Finland was positively correlated with reproductive output, a desirable basis for applying sustainable management to this species. Teal and wigeon have much longer, more complex flyways, and their harvest did not mirror the annual production of young, although the wigeon harvest in Denmark increased with increasing juvenile ratio there. For these populations, we need to better define population units if we are to be able to assess harvest sustainability. We urgently need to monitor duck breeding success and harvest at larger spatial scales to support a comprehensive analysis of how well the harvest reflects reproductive output.

AB  - The switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals and the loss of habitat heterogeneity are often suggested to be key drivers of breeding bird decline on arable farmland. Yet, both factors are interlinked and it remains uncertain whether autumn-sown cereals reduce breeding bird numbers also in the structurally complex arable farmland of northern Europe. We tested whether autumn-sowing of cereals at both local and landscape scales affected the breeding bird community in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. Rotation between sowing types was used as a semi-experiment based on 34 spring- vs. 41 autumn-sown cereal plots centred on infield non-crop islands of similar structure, size and surroundings. Species richness and territory abundance of ground-foraging species were significantly lower in autumn- than in spring-sown cereal plots both in the crop fields and the infield non-crop islands during the breeding season. No such effect was observed among foliage gleaning birds. Species richness in spring-sown cereal plots was less the more autumn-sown crops in the surrounding landscape within a 500 m radius. Average skylark densities did not differ between autumn- and spring-sown cereal plots because habitat preferences changed; densities declined in autumn-sown cereals during the growing season whereas they increased on spring-sown fields which had shorter swards throughout the breeding season. Our results indicate that negative effects of autumn-sown crops on breeding bird numbers spill over into both neighbouring non-crop and crop habitats. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes should place more emphasis on facilitating the value of the cropped area of fields as a foraging and nesting habitat. The retention of various non-crop habitats alone may not provide sufficient food close to nest sites for farmland birds that rely on crop fields for foraging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The illicit transnational trades in cultural goods and wildlife, while distinct, share many characteristics. This article identifies and compares the intricacies of controlling trafficking in cultural objects and wildlife from a customs perspective. Findings indicate that in Norwegian customs, the countering of wildlife trafficking benefits from at least two conditions: 1) officers have become more aware of the characteristics and harmful consequences of the trade, and 2) efficient interactions with other stakeholders ensure tangible outcomes in the form of seizures and punishment of offenders. While challenges remain, these factors serve to motivate officers and, in the last decade, have strengthened the control of wildlife trafficking. The countering of illicit trade in cultural objects, however, does not benefit from such circumstances. Findings suggest that the officers' awareness of, and attitude towards, trafficking of such materials are key factors to consider for evolving the response.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a regional nutrient demand-based approach to assess the potential use of digestate nutrients from a planned biogas plant investment as a part of a regional circular economy concept. The assumed biogas plant is expected to treat urban wastes; biowastes (23,500 t/y) and sewage sludges (120,000 t/y) from the Tampere region, Finland (total population of 500,000). The calculation of the regional nutrient balance was based on the fertilizable crop areas, fertilization regimes and biomass nutrient amounts, with an assumption that livestock manures were primarily utilized in crop production. Subsequently, a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodology was applied to evaluate the transportation distances of nutrients from the biogas plant to the closest crop fields. As a result from the presented approach, livestock manure covered 41% and 12% of the phosphorus (P) and soluble nitrogen (N) need of the studied region. There was a residual potential for the regional utilization of biogas plant nutrients, which together with the livestock manure accounted for 50% of P and 15% of soluble-N need. Transportation of nutrients up to 40 km from the biogas plant is necessary if all nearby fields receive the waste-based nutrients, while the distance increased to 66 km if 30% of the local farmers are willing to use the nutrients. The approach presented in this study acts as a tool for planning nutrient cycles, which can be used to sustainably manage the regional nutrient flows when planning a new biogas plant investment.

AB  - In 1996, the Directorate for Nature Management published an action plan for goose management in Norway. The Action Plan covers all the seven Norwegian goose species, which differ significantly with respect to population status and conflict potential. The conflicts between geese and agriculture (farmers) are focused upon and the plan aims to create a common understanding of the need for reducing conflicts and to ensure viable geese populations. As most goose populations spend time in several European countries throughout the year, international collaboration is necessary to achieve the goals outlined in the plan. This paper focuses on the Svalbard goose populations and outlines the main objectives for management of these populations.

AB  - Black Fungus Gnats (Sciaridae) are a megadiverse, cosmopoliltan family of bibionomorph Diptera. Even in Europe, the continent with the longest tradition in sciarid taxonomy, numerous taxonomic issues remain unresolved and countless species await discovery and description. The fauna of Norway is in these respects no exception. Recognising considerable knowledge gaps, the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre provided substantial funding for a detailed inventory of the Sciaridae species occurring in Norway, which was realised in 2014-2018. The results of this project will be published in a series of papers, of which the first is presented here, summarising available data on the taxonomy, faunistics, and autecology of Norwegian Sciaridae beginning with Zetterstedt's pioneering work in 1838 and ending with 31 December 2019 as the cut-off date. All published records from that period were analysed. The result is a list of 143 species and four unplaced names. Following a consistent scheme, verified locality details are provide including alternative spellings, habitats, and flight times of adults in Norway, literature citations for the faunistic records, and general taxonomic references for classification or identification. A checklist of the sciarid fauna of Norway and a complete list of the relevant literature are also presented.

AB  - The REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites) model was applied to a pollen dataset from a large lake in western Norway to reconstruct the vegetation cover throughout the last c. 11,400 years. The reconstructions, based on 18 common taxa, show development of a forested landscape until c. 5600 cal yr BP, followed by several phases of opening and reforestation, probably connected to variation in the intensity and type of human impact. From c. 5600 cal yr BP (Early Neolithic) to c. 3200 cal yr BP (Early Bronze Age), a general increase in openness takes place, with increased deforestation c. 4300 and 4000 cal yr BP. More extensive forest clearances are seen at 2750 cal yr BP (Late Bronze Age) and 1800 cal yr BP (Roman Iron Age). Reforestation is recognised at c. 5400, 4100, 3600, 2900, 1900, 1200, 700 and 300 cal yr BP. Calluna is present in the vegetation both in the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, and heathland expansion is inferred to take place in the Late Bronze Age, with further expansion c. 1800 and 950 cal yr BP, probably reflecting increased use of outfield resources at the expense of grasslands. Forest disturbance and grazing are inferred to have taken place from 5600 cal yr BP, and communities comparable to historical time periods have existed from 2750 cal yr BP. An expansion in the area used for cereal cultivation probably took place in the Roman Iron Age. In the last century, from c. 1920, an expansion of conifers takes place, and Picea shows a strong increase during the last twenty years. Changes in both forest composition and land-cover are more clearly reflected with the REVEALS model than from the pollen percentage diagram, and the probability of presence of taxa within the region is demonstrated. REVEALS modelling combined with archaeological data is recommended as an approach to gain increased knowledge about land-cover changes through time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vision Zero (VZ) is a systematic approach whose goal is to reduce the fatalities and serious injuries suffered in road accidents to zero, which was first adopted in Sweden in 1997. Besides assessing the policy implementation in the Polish town of Jaworzno, this paper applies VZ as a framework to describe transport policy development in Jaworzno. It concludes, that even without an explicitly defined strategical VZ document, the action taken by city officials in Jaworzno clearly overlaps with VZ, as evidenced in Sweden. Also, strong political commitment, clear leadership and a dynamic approach to adjust the development according to new evidence, show the city of Jaworzno to be a learning institution in its enhancement of road safety and its support of sustainable development.

AB  - Model-based quantitative reconstruction of past plant cover in Europe has shown great potential for: (i) testing hypotheses related to Holocene vegetation dynamics, biodiversity, and their relationships with climate and land use; (ii) studying long term interactions between climate and land use. Similar model-based quantitative reconstruction of plant cover in China has been restricted due to the lack of standardized datasets of existing estimates of relative pollen productivity (RPP). This study presents the first synthesis of all RPP values available to date for 39 major plant taxa from temperate China and proposes standardized RPP datasets that can be used for model-based quantitative reconstructions of past plant cover using fossil pollen records for the region. We review 11 RPP studies in temperate China based on modern pollen and related vegetation data around the pollen samples. The study areas include meadow, steppe and desert vegetation, various woodland types, and cultural landscapes. We evaluate the strategies of each study in terms of selection of study areas and distribution of study sites; pollen- and vegetation-data collection in field; vegetation-data collection from satellite images and vegetation maps; and data analysis. We compare all available RPP estimates, select values based on precise rules and calculate mean RPP estimates. We propose two standardized RPP datasets for 31 (Alt1) and 29 (Alt2) plant taxa. The ranking of mean RPPs (Alt-2) relative to Poaceae (= 1) for eight major taxa is: Artemisia (21) > Pinus (18.4) > Betula (12.5) > Castanea (11.5) > Elaeagnaceae (8.8) > Juglans (7.5) > Compositae (4.5) > Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae (4). We conclude that although RPPs are comparable between Europe and China for some genera and families, they can differ very significantly, e.g., Artemisia, Compositae, and Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae. For some taxa, we present the first RPP estimates e.g. Castanea, Elaeagnaceae, and Juglans. The proposed standardized RPP datasets are essential for model-based reconstructions of past plant cover using fossil pollen records from temperate China.

AB  - This article examines the consumption of climbing tourists to Norway and Sweden to show how consumers are captured by collective story worlds in communal consumption. Whereas prior marketing research has been preoccupied with narrative transportation as a mental imagery process, we suggest a sociology of narrative approach that focuses on the institutional shaping of communities within which consumers engage in cultural formation with a shared social and historical context. Our empirical findings show that consumers in the climbing community experience two distinct story worlds, with different ethos, conventions and content rules, that structure why and how stories are told. We extend existing knowledge within marketing through a multifaceted understanding of how collective narratives operate and present a sociocultural model of story world tension in communal consumption.

AB  - The history of the boreal forest of Scandinavia is characterized by view low human population density and relatively late impact by modern forestry. The coniferous boreal forest has changed dramatically since the late 19th century, which, in turn, has resulted in loss of biodiversity. Some of the most important ecological changes include fire suppression, loss of dead and dying trees, and loss of multi-storeyed old-growth forest. These changes warrant, among other things, restoration efforts on different spatial scales in order to enhance and protect biodiversity for the future.

AB  - This study addresses the need for more knowledge about the growing number of food tourists. The objective is to describe the effects of enduring food involvement on consumers' behaviour in terms of food consumption, food-related activities and travel. The theoretical concepts of involvement, gastronomic identity and travel motives are elaborated to model the causes and effects of food involvement. Five proposals are suggested about involvement having effects on consumers' identities, attitudes, motivations and travel behaviour. The five proposals are tested by first identifying a category of "food enthusiasts" defined as the top 25% in a population of urban citizens in terms of enduring food involvement and second by comparing "food enthusiasts" to other consumers. All five proposals are strongly supported by survey data. Practical implications are that destination management organizations and restaurants, as well as tourism attractions serving food, cannot ignore that a large segment of the urban population is highly involved in food. There are many good reasons to serve food that fulfils normal criteria for sustainable food, that is healthy and that is locally produced.

AB  - Efforts are on the way on the Swedish West Coast to develop the capacity for cultivation of marine resources, notably of kelps. Given that this is a region of great natural and national heritage, public opposition to marine developments has been identified as a possible risk factor. This survey thus sought to shed light on awareness levels, perceptions of different types of aquaculture and on reactions to a scenario depicting future aquaculture developments on the West Coast. When asked about their general opinions of aquaculture, respondents tended to be favourable though a majority chose neutral responses. On the whole, respondents were favourable to the depicted scenario. Finally, it was found that the high-awareness group tended to be more supportive than the low or medium-awareness groups, hinting at the benefits of increasing awareness to reduce public aversion and to support a sustainable development of aquaculture on the Swedish West Coast.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to analyze potential effects on the Swedish forest sector of a continuing rise in the use of forest resources as a fuel in energy generation. The background to the problem can be found in the commitments Sweden has made concerning energy policy. Two such commitments are the phase-out of nuclear power, and a decision that the Swedish energy system should be sustainable, i.e., it should be based on renewable resources. However, an increasing use of forest resources as an energy input may have effects outside the energy sector. In this paper we attempt to consider this by estimating a system of demand and supply equations for the four main actors on the Swedish roundwood market; forestry, sawmills, pulpmills, and the energy sector. The purpose of the paper is thus to analyze the effects on each of these markets as a result of a switch in energy policy, towards an increase in the use of biofuels.

AB  - Urbanization of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is usually considered a recent phenomenon, originated in southern England in the 1930s, and having only thereafter spread, or independently originated, elsewhere. In this paper we show that in Finland red foxes have probably been hunted in the vicinity or outskirts of towns at least since the 18th century, and that foxes have been well-known (although unwelcome) visitors in urban areas at least since the late 19th century. One hunter captured 56 red foxes in a small hilly area in the outskirts of the city of Turku, SW Finland, in 1743-1747. In the leading newspaper of Turku urban or periurban visits by red foxes were reported 15 times in 1890-1950, and in 1890-1920 local newspapers in Finland reported urban observations of red foxes in three of the nine cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants at the onset of the First World War. In several instances foxes were reported to have preyed upon domestic fowl. Several fox reports concerned apparently tame individuals. Red foxes were probably attracted to urban areas by the low hygiene levels and human-dependent fauna associated with urban agriculture. We found no direct evidence for reproduction of foxes within urban areas in the study period. Although urban areas were apparently included in the feeding territories of many foxes, active persecution probably prevented establishment of local urban populations. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The explosive growth of peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation service presents a potential transformation in the competitive landscape of accommodation sector. This research explores the market characteristics and the factors that drive and hinder the use of P2P accommodation to better explain the phenomenon of collaborative consumption in the tourism and hospitality marketplace. Using responses from travellers residing in the United States and Finland, exploratory factor analyses revealed two factors that drive the use of P2P accommodation: social appeal (desire for community and sustainability) and economic appeal (cost savings). The barriers include issues of trust, efficacy and familiarity with the system, and cost. The empirical evidence from this study suggests several managerial implications for tourism and hospitality businesses and directions for future research.

AB  - We tested the effect of a large ungulate carcass on boreal forest biodiversity by contrasting the local abundance and diversity of Coleoptera around a roe deer Capreolus capreolus carcass and in a control plot, between 8 August and 3 September 2003, in southern Norway. The two plots differed both in occurrence and richness of species, which were almost double at the carcass plot, although the diversity indices were similar. The higher evenness of the control plot compensated for its lower number of species, probably because the carcass plot was a disturbed area, colonized by many species, which were represented by few individuals. The number of beetles captured each day correlated positively with temperature at the control plot, but not at the carcass plot, indicating that the presence of an abundant and concentrated resource increased the local activity of Coleoptera. The carcass is likely to create a particular microclimate, which could partly buffer against extremes of air-temperature variation. These preliminary results indicate that ungulate carcasses have a significant ecological impact, which should be further investigated to improve the management and restoration of European boreal forest ecosystems.

AB  - In the Spitsbergen treaty of 1920, Norway acquired sovereignty over the Spitsbergen Islands. Rather than Woodrow Wilson, the American president, the architects behind the treaty were Robert Lansing, Wilson's secretary of state, and, behind the diplomatic scene, the mining investor, John M. Longyear. In 1906, Longyear established a mining company to exploit the coal deposits at Spitsbergen. He induced Congress, the State Department, and the White House to forge an American policy for the European Arctic, including the appointment of Lansing, an international lawyer, as a counsel in the State Department. Lansing was a leading expert on both international law and the lack of state authority at the terra nullius, Spitsbergen. In 1915, he became secretary of State and, at the Paris Peace Conference, decided American policy regarding the Spitsbergen question. This analysis shows how the outcome of the Spitsbergen question was a result of American mining interests, supplemented by Norwegian-American shared interests in conflict resolution based on international law.

AB  - The economic sanctions in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis threatened external cross-border cooperation (CBC) funded by the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) in the summer of 2014. The European Union considered several of the ENI CBC programmes that Finland and Russia participate in for the sanctions list. These programmes are implemented by a multiplicity of actors that include supra-national, national and regional authorities and form a dense actor-network with vertical and horizontal relations. The political relations between the actors are influenced by geopolitical discourses, bordering effects and power imbalances that are conceptualised in this paper as practices of territoriality. Previous research has insufficiently addressed the territoriality of actor relations within the multi-level governance (MLG) structures of CBC. Territoriality is present in MLG in the sense that CBC actors from various political levels significantly contribute to the territorial logic of political power by promoting their own interests towards cooperation practices. The research problem in this paper stems from the alleged non-hierarchical organisation of actors in CBC and argues that MLG policy structures do not render equality among the different actors and that they fail to consider the impact of territoriality. The paper investigates how territoriality influences the actor relations in the MLG structure of ENI CBC and how the actors cope with the frictions that emerge out of territoriality. Qualitative interviews reveal a conflicting system of governance in Finnish-Russian ENI CBC that fluctuates between state centrality and region-based initiatives to address frictions of various territorialit(ies) produced by actors.

AB  - The debate around the social licence to operate (SLO) has been lively in recent years. In its elementary forms, the SLO is interpreted as the social acceptance granted by a community to mineral exploration and mining activities. Our theoretical assumption is that the SLO as a concept is both case-specific and more general, contingent, among other things, upon public opinion. In this study, acceptance is considered as general and anticipatory in the sense that it can act as a precondition for individual SLOs. Our intention is to contribute especially to recent novel research focusing on the more general background and factors contributing to the SLO. Using survey data (N = 1064), we explore relationships of factors potentially connected to the SLO in two Finnish regions where in the last decade mining has been a growing industry. We are concerned with the connection between the acceptability of mining and six factors measured by nine variables. The findings show that the six factors investigated are indeed connected to acceptance but not in any straightforward manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptive management (AM) is one approach to manage migratory waterbirds, but obstacles to the implementation of AM require adaptive capacities in the management system (rules, institutions, action situations). This study aims to examine the adaptive capacity of participatory goose management in Sweden. Considering the biophysical and institutional context, we analyzed how tangible, individual, and governance assets were associated with technical and social learning. Interviews with informants in the national council for geese, swans, and cranes, and local management groups (LMGs) were conducted, and documentation reviewed. Results revealed evidence of a local preparedness in areas with an LMG. Nevertheless, the study highlighted a need to formalize the evolving system, to consider a more systematic implementation of AM (including regulations allowing for adaptive responses), and to ensure stakeholder acceptance for management tools and visions. The study illustrates the need for a broad set of assets to ensure learning in participatory management.

AB  - This article examines the cultural and ideological implications of the fact that the protagonist in the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun's novel Pan: Af Lojtnant Thomas Glahns Papirer (1894) is a tourist. It makes explicit the conceptual links between Hamsun's use of tourism and underlying colonialist implications, particularly in terms of the sexual economy of the text. Drawing on John Urry's notion of the 'tourist gaze' (1990) and Robert J. C. Young's concept of 'colonial desire' (1995), the article demonstrates that Thomas Glahn's occupation of the other space or 'heterotopia' (Foucault 1986) of the cabin offers him a position from which to exercise the tourist gaze and act out a fantasy of colonial and sexual domination, both in the main narrative and in the novel's epilogue.

AB  - In this article, we study the interaction of nature and technology in terms of policy and business activities in Sweden during the 1970s and 1980s. These activities aimed to reduce the impact of the mining industry on the natural environment while maintaining industrial competitiveness. In order to address this challenge, it was and still is important to identify ways that businesses can promote sustainable development without hazarding their continued operations and investments. Here, the design and implementation of environmental regulations are of central importance. This study relies on a rich set of documents related to 1970s and 1980s environmental licensing processes of the operations of the two largest mining companies in Sweden, Boliden AB and LKAB, both situated close to the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden. Historians have much to offer policymakers, and this article demonstrates that good examples that permit us to reflect on future pathways for policy design can not only be found in other countries' current policy, but also further back in time.

AB  - Analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of the small mammal cycle in Fennoscandia have led to two main conclusions: a south-north geographical gradient in the strength of density dependence and period length, and a change in temporal dynamics with less clear periodicity and lower amplitude of fluctuations in recent years. Fourteen years (1985-1998) of small mammals trapping and Tengmalm's owls monitoring data provided clear evidence for 3-yr cycles of two vote species in inner Troms, north Norway, at the same latitude and only 80 km from Kilpisjarvi, north Finland, where 4-5-yr cycles have been the norm until the end of 1980s. The response of Tengmalm's owls to variation in small rodents abundance was not delayed, as was observed in central Finland. Common shrews appeared to have more stable dynamics. The features of the cycle, and a reassessment of the previously described patterns, show that the dynamics may be different over short distances. Furthermore, snow cover and habitat fragmentation should explicitly be taken into account in any understanding of the Fermoscandian gradient, and surrogate variables such as latitude should be avoided. We stress the need for a more extensive coverage of spatial and temporal patterns in cyclicity with respect to assumed ecological causes.

AB  - Grazing generally benefits grassland biodiversity as it prevents shrub and tree succession. However, too intense grazing may have negative effects for example many grassland insects. EU-subsidies for grazing of some habitats, aimed at promoting biodiversity, still require a relatively intense grazing, and could therefore have negative consequences for some species. We quantified how such grazing affects habitat quality for the marsh fritillary butterfly, and how this influence its colonization-extinction dynamics and persistence. Specifically, we studied a metapopulation on Gotland (Sweden), where the marsh fritillary occupies unfertilized calcareous grassland with a naturally slow succession. We quantified the difference in larvae autumn nests between grazed and ungrazed habitat, and used this difference to adjust the 'effective area' of 256 habitat patches in a 50 km(2) landscape. We then parameterized a metapopulation model based on the occurrence pattern of the adult butterfly, and simulated future population development under different grazing regimes. The results showed that ungrazed habitat harbored 4.8 times more nests than grazed habitat. Reducing the 'effective area' of grazed patches accordingly increased the local extinction probability and decreased colonization. Grazing all suitable habitat reduced the occupancy by over 80%, while no grazing increased the occupancy by up to 40%, based on projections of future dynamics. Current grazing is clearly too intense, and EU-subsidies are here, thus, a conservation measure with negative consequences for a threatened butterfly. To prevent this, subsidies for grazing need to be more flexible and better adapted to the prevailing soil conditions and requirements of the target species.

AB  - Aquaculture is among the most dynamic sectors in the global food system, yet it remains surprisingly underrepresented in the mainstream literature on food policy. This article reviews 204 published articles and reports and shows that government policies have strongly influenced the geographic distribution of aquaculture growth, as well as the types of species, technology, management practices, and infrastructure adopted in different locations. Global cross-section studies reveal a broad spectrum of under- to over-regulated aquaculture systems that correspond, respectively, to high- and low-growth areas for aquaculture. The bulk of this paper centers on aquaculture policy as it plays out six individual countries plus the EU: Bangladesh, Zambia, Chile, China, USA, and Norway. These case studies shed light on aquaculture policies aimed at economic development, aquaculture disease management, siting, environmental performance, and trade protection. Experiences from these countries point to the need to find the right policy balance between semi-subsistence farms, small and medium enterprises (SME), and large-scale commercial operations, particularly in low-income settings. The cases also highlight the importance of addressing aquaculture disease pressures and misuse of antimicrobials in many parts of the world, and identifying successful aquaculture policy instruments and institutions that can be transferred between countries. The review underscores the challenges of establishing nutrition-sensitive aquaculture policies and of incorporating aquaculture directly into food policy and global food system dialogues and action.

AB  - Why do some tourists leave the beaten track and spend time and energy working in remote farms for food and accommodation through the WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) network? WWOOF now celebrates its 50th anniversary. This study draws on a Norwegian survey of 1184 WWOOF respondents from 92 countries. It is the first large-scale quantitative study to establish a motivation profile for volunteer tourists, who are members of the WWOOF. The analyses revealed seven primary motivations: Immigration, Escapism, Genuine Norwegian Interest, Sustainable Lifestyle, Cheap Travel, Constraints, and Secondary Image. Pull motivations were stronger than push motivations. The former represents an urge to take on a journey while the latter represents the attraction to a certain goal. Two motivation factors combined push and pull motivations. Six of the factors were interpreted as self-interest and one as altruistic motivation. The results both support some and challenge other studies on this subject.

AB  - Fredrika Bremer (1801-65) was a Swedish novelist and reformer primarily known for her role in advocating for women's voting and property rights in Sweden. This article analyzes her 1849-51 journey through North America and argues that she was also an important environmental figure who deserves renewed attention from environmental historians because of her embodied approach to environmental aesthetics, or what I call "aesthetic habitation." More broadly, Bremer's story suggests that environmental history needs an "aesthetic imperative" to go along with the more traditional moral and analytical imperatives of the field.

AB  - Forest species composition was recorded in 82 forests in the Himmerland and Hornsherred regions in Denmark and analysed with respect to isolation (distance to other forests and areas of forest), forest continuity (older or younger than 200 yr), soil pH, tree species composition and seed dispersal groups. Continuity and isolation measures were correlated with forest species richness in Hornsherred. Myrmecochorous, autochorous, anemoballistic and endozoochorous species were markedly fewer in recent than in ancient forests. In Himmerland, patterns were much weaker and few significant correlations were found between forest species richness or different seed dispersal groups and continuity or isolation of the forests. Differences between the two regions may result from less intensive land use, a more humid climate and a smaller species pool with less species with short distance dispersal in Himmerland. Landscape fragmentation therefore appears to limit forest species' recolonization more in Hornsherred than in Himmerland.

AB  - The current trend of higher education for sustainable urban development links with parallel developments in urban governance and environmental pedagogy. Many programs and policies identify cities and citizens as key drivers of change for sustainable futures, however scholarly work on the related pedagogies is lacking. These endeavors are clearly present in the Tampere city-region, Finland. Supported by national educational and city-regional strategies, the city is promoting sustainable lifestyles and infrastructures by means of multistakeholder governance including citizen participation and sustainability education. This paper analyzes, as a case study of transdisciplinary sustainability education, a collaboration between Tampere University, a skateboarding high school, and the Hiedanranta urban district developed as a real-life laboratory of sustainable urban development. We explore the pedagogical dimensions of the collaboration by drawing from the theoretical perspective of 'positive recognition' and conceiving the Hiedanranta skatescape-a socio-physical entity formed around skateboarding-as a 'boundary object'. The paper suggests urban environments act as boundary objects that enable productive collaboration between various actors when informed by pedagogies of positive recognition. In conclusion, we propose that the value of this approach, binding together multistakeholder governance and transdisciplinary learning, lies in its capacity to encourage novel forms of sustainable agency.

AB  - 1. High cover of forest in the landscape matrix has been shown to weaken the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland butterflies. No studies have however focused on examining species-specific responses of grassland butterflies to forest.
   2. The data from 3 years of butterfly monitoring in Southern Finland were used to test whether the amount of forest cover in the surrounding landscape affected the abundance of grassland butterfly species in semi-natural grasslands, field margins, and forest edges.
   3. More than half of the studied species benefitted from high cover of forest. Species with the strongest preference for forested landscapes were Lycaena virgaureae, Argynnis adippe, Argynnis aglaja, and Boloria selene, which probably find suitable resources in herbaceous habitats at forest edges and clearings.
   4. Several small-sized species were positively affected by surrounding forest cover in field margins but not in the other habitat types. Although field margins are suboptimal habitats for grassland butterflies, they provide important corridors for dispersal. High cover of forest in the landscape matrix may enhance butterfly dispersal along field margins by reducing windiness, which is likely to be most important for small-sized species with poor dispersal capacity.
   5. The most abundant grassland species showed little or no preference for forested landscapes.
   6. Our results suggest that high cover of forest enhances the persistence of most grassland butterflies, including declining species, in boreal agricultural landscapes. The responses to forest are however strongly dependent on species-specific properties and habitat types.

AB  - Sources of anthropogenic noise in the ocean have temporal and directional characteristics. Characterizing the soundscape requires identifying the directionality of the sources of noise in addition to the non-directional sound pressure. An underwater acoustic vector sensor (AVS) can be used to provide the directionality of incoming noise, and the concomitant sound pressure. We present an analysis of measurements from an AVS deployed in a Norwegian fjord in which there is frequent commercial ship traffic. We assessed the directionality of various known and unknown noise sources and used it to interpret the associated sound pressure. The fjord soundscape consists of time-varying noise directionality and intensity from anthropogenic sources, especially shipping activity. This case study highlights the benefits of using information from an AVS to assess noise directionality in a soundscape.

AB  - The aim of the study was to develop a method for shaping the safe space of rural areas in view of the increasingly frequent extreme weather phenomena resulting from climate change. The study was carried out on the assumption that geographic data, which decrease or increase the risk of financial loss caused by extreme weather events, can be identified. A group of selected characteristics was used to construct a synthetic parameter for measuring an entity's vulnerability to financial loss, based on the existing conditions in the evaluated area. The developed parameter was referred to as the vulnerability index, which value determines a community's sensitivity to extreme weather phenomena. The vulnerability index was used in further analyses. In the next step of the study, changes in the values of the proposed index were evaluated in scenarios, where adaptive measures were and were not implemented. Three types of scenarios were analyzed: baseline, optimistic and pessimistic. The adopted assumptions accounted for the possibility of future change in rural areas. The optimistic scenario was developed on the assumption that the undertaken adaptive measures would focus on greening in agricultural holdings and afforestation according to the concept proposed by the Polish government. The pessimistic scenario was developed on the assumption that human activities would not be adapted to climate change, while space would change according to the scenarios described by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and insurance companies. The results demonstrated that the vulnerability index will continue to increase, unless adaptive measures are undertaken. Therefore, adaptive measures have to be implemented to increase the resistance of entities to the losses caused by extreme weather phenomena.

AB  - In the boreal biome, forest fires are the most important natural disturbance influencing tree substrate availability and quality for a range of specialized species. This includes the Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus, which is known to promptly utilize burned forest habitats. However, there are no studies addressing the foraging behaviour of this woodpecker in forests affected by wildfire. Such knowledge could assist the development of efficient post-fire management strategies which are in line with biodiversity conservation objectives. This study describes the foraging behaviour of the Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker during the breeding season in a forest area of 13,100 ha in south-central Sweden affected by a major wildfire in 2014. During the second breeding season after fire, we used instantaneous sampling where we observed the foraging behaviour of 28 individuals during a total of 1681 observation minutes. Our results suggest that Norway Spruce Picea abies and larger diameter trees (DBH > 25 cm) are important foraging substrates. However, data on time spent foraging on the different substrates suggest that Scots Pines Pinus sylvestris also are important. In particular, we identified the importance of the root collars, where excavation into sapwood was the main foraging method. Our study was performed during a clearly visible peak of Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker abundance and this may suggest that the level of food resources available was very high which led to observed foraging patterns not necessarily observed in other types of habitats.

AB  - Background: Shallow nearshore marine ecosystems are changing at an increasing rate due to a range of human activities such as urbanisation and commercial development. As a result, an increasing number of structural modifications occur in coastal nursery and spawning habitats of fish. Concomitant to this increase, there have been declines in many coastal fish populations and changes in the composition of fish communities. As requested by Swedish stakeholders, this review aimed to synthesise scientific evidence of the impact on fish recruitment of structural modifications in temperate coastal areas.
   Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature on such impacts in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish. Searches were performed in bibliographic databases, specialist websites, bibliographies of review articles. We also contacted stakeholder to find relevant literature. Eligible studies included small- and large-scale field studies in marine systems and large lakes (> 10,000 km(2)) in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Included replicated comparisons of fish recruitment between altered and unaltered control areas, comparisons before and after an alteration, or both. Relevant outcomes (response variables) included measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juvenile fish in coastal habitats. All fish species were considered. Articles were screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text. Eligible studies were critically appraised based on their external and internal validity. From each eligible study of sufficient validity, we extracted information on study design, measured outcomes, exposure, type of comparator, effect modifiers and study findings. Study findings were synthesised narratively.
   Results: We searched for eligible studies in 15 databases, 24 specialist websites, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of 11 review articles. The review finally included 37 studies that were eligible and of sufficient validity to be considered for final synthesis. Most studies (23 of 37) were from the Northern Hemisphere. Studies varied in design, spatial resolution, target fish species, and type of structural habitat change. This high level of variation did not allow for a quantitative synthesis and prevented us from drawing general conclusions on the impact of structures or structural modifications on fish recruitment. In this review we provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base and classify eligible studies into six categories (based on type of exposure and comparator). The categories are as follows: the impacts on fish recruitment of: (1) artificial structures in coastal areas, (2) structures designed as fish attractors, (3) large scale urban sprawl, (4) 'novel' habitats, (5) habitat loss, and (6) restoration.
   Conclusions: This review revealed a very limited evidence base for how structural modifications and marine urban sprawl can affect fish recruitment. Thus, there is a substantial mismatch between stakeholder needs and research evidence. Further, the impact and ecological performance of artificial structures depend both on context and species. Clearly, there is a need for more research on the subject, especially on long-term consequences at larger spatial scales.

AB  - Biodiversity offsetting is a governance mechanism proposed as a solution to ecosystem degradation and the underlying economic drivers. Biodiversity offsetting's potential is often evaluated and argued with ecological and economic criteria. These factors are intertwined with a multitude of social and ideological conditions for acceptance and legitimacy, which have received less systematic empirical attention especially from the perspective of the actors who implement the offsets. In this paper, we empirically analyse how companies and authorities, the central actors applying biodiversity offsetting in practice, perceive the social acceptance in the design and implementation of the emerging mechanism in Finland. The interview data analysed with three interlinked dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political acceptance, market acceptance and community acceptance reveal where the mechanism's implementation may face friction with the central actors. While the importance of social acceptance of biodiversity offsetting shows to be a priority for the actors that will be implementing the mechanism and carrying the responsibility of the offsets in practice, the division of roles and benefits remains a point of tension, in the political sphere, in the market and in the community. Our analysis points to the necessity of integrating social and local values alongside ecological and economic ones as a way to address social acceptance. Finding the limits to flexibility between ecological, economic and social aspects is important in order to reach the diverse objectives of a BO mechanism.

AB  - When offshore oil and gas infrastructure is no longer needed, it is either removed, partially removed, left in place, or left in place but repurposed. These processes are collectively referred to as decommissioning. Australian legislation requires oil and gas companies to develop acceptable plans for the safe removal of all offshore infrastructure at the end of a project's life. Over the next 50 years, the liability for this decommissioning in Australia is expected to exceed US$45 billion. Unlike countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, Australian decommissioning activities are in their infancy, with only three cases (to date) in Commonwealth waters where infrastructure has been left in place or partially removed as part of decommissioning. Differences between the Australian marine environment and that of other regions around the world where decommissioning-related research is better progressed include very low sedimentation rates, both tropical and temperate habitats, different species composition, low primary production, and frequent tropical cyclones, as well as unique sociodemographic and cultural characteristics. Accordingly, the outcomes of the decision support tools used in other regions to identify preferred decommissioning options may not be equally applicable in Australia. Here we describe research to support risk and impact assessment for offshore decommissioning in Australia, where full removal of infrastructure is the "base case" regulatory default, but other options including partial removal and/or repurposing might provide similar or better outcomes when environmental, social, economic and seafood safety aspects are considered. Based on our review we propose an integrated framework for research needs to meet legislative requirements for decommissioning and identify research gaps that need to be addressed to inform decision-making for decommissioning in the Australian context.

AB  - Background: In order to support decisions regarding governance, organization and control models of the healthcare system, the Swedish government, as well as regional-level agencies, regularly commissions expert reports that are supposed to form the basis for decisions on new steering forms in healthcare. Aim: The aim of this study was a) to perform a descriptive mapping of commissioned reports on Swedish healthcare governance and b) to pursue an in-depth content analysis of a strategic sample of such reports. Method: Initially, 106 reports from both national and regional levels were gathered and analysed. A matrix was constructed, consisting of questions on who had commissioned the report, who had produced it, what problems the report set out to solve and what solutions were suggested. Further, questions were posed on whether the report was research-based and whether ethical assumptions and arguments were presented. Thereafter, a strategic sample of 36 reports was selected for an in-depth analysis, using inductive content analysis. Results: The descriptive mapping showed that the aim of the analysed reports differed in form and content, and that they varied from giving an overview and investigating effects and consequences of new control models to more concrete goals, such as suggesting improvement measures. Academic experts involved in creating the reports often represented economics or business studies. The content analysis revealed examples of standardization in care, characterized by requirements to follow national guidelines, but also examples of requests for increased respect for professionals' competence and experience. Further, the analysis showed how the definition of equity in care had changed, from a focus on equity in access to care in the reports produced in the 1990s to an emphasis of arguments for geographical sameness and equity in quality of care in the later reports. Discussion: Two dominant trends were identified in the material, namely increased standardization and arguments for trust in the system. The great number of reports implies that the system risks requesting more information than it can handle and result in documents where the same message is recurrently repeated or create conflicts of interest and value tensions between different suggestions. Conclusion: Commissioned reports can have substantial consequences for new reforms of management practices in healthcare. It is therefore important to investigate them critically. The results of our investigation may contribute to a more comprehensive and adequate model for acquiring and using expert reports regarding healthcare governance, both in Sweden and in similar healthcare systems.

AB  - Today, over 94% of all adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are in the aquaculture niche and wild numbers continue to decline while aquaculture numbers increase. The developmental and evolutionary forces in the aquaculture or "domestic" niche are so unlike those in the wild niche that two distinct biologies are being created from the original Atlantic salmon species. We may now need to recognize a new biological entity-Salmo domesticus-and treat it as an "exotic" when it escapes into the wild. Escapement therefore raises important concerns about ecological and genetic impacts, both within and outside the native range of Salmo salar. This paper explains why escaped domestic Atlantic salmon have had an impact on wild Atlantic salmon populations and now threaten Pacific salmonids as well. A polarization of views between aquaculturists and environmentalists will not resolve the problems. The three interest groups in fisheries-aquaculture, biodiversity, and capture-must begin to work together if we are to take up the challenge of preserving biodiversity and if aquaculturists, who hold the future of Atlantic salmon in their hands, can be expected to willingly prevent further impacts from their industry.

CP  - BCPC International Conference on Pests and Diseases
AB  - The Integrated Production (IP) of field vegetable crops was started in Sweden in 1992 by the growers' organisation. 60% of the vegetable acreage is included in the IP-project that encourages an ecologically and economically sound growing system. The IP-rules, that have to be followed on the entire farm, state that crop protection should be based on preventative and cultural methods. Biological control should be given priority and the use of pesticides minimised. Monitoring of pests, diseases and weeds must be done regularly. Food safety has priority and the growers' working environment should be improved. Education, documentation and control are mandatory. The IP concept is well in line with the official Swedish policy to develop a sustainable agriculture. Programmes for pesticide risk reduction and pesticide use reduction have run since 1985. The difference between IP and conventionally produced vegetables in Sweden is, as regards crop protection, relatively small. This can be explained by the continuous tightening of laws and legal restrictions which are mandatory for all growers, and the lack of sufficient Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools. Documentation and traceability give added value to the IP produce.

AB  - The sustainable management of water resources is required to avoid water scarcity becoming widespread. This article explores the potential application of a social-ecological framework, used predominantly in the fields of ecology and conservation, as a tool to improve the sustainability and resilience of water resources. The ?red-loop green-loop? (RL-GL) model has previously been used to map both sustainable and unsustainable social-ecological feedbacks between ecosystems and their communities in countries such as Sweden and Jamaica. In this article, we demonstrate the novel application of the RL-GL framework to water resources management using the 2017/18 Cape Town water crisis. We used the framework to analyse the social-ecological dynamics of pre-crisis and planned contingency scenarios. We found that the water resources management system was almost solely reliant on a single, non ecosystem form of infrastructure, the provincial dam system. As prolonged drought impacted this key water resource, resilience to resource collapse was shown to be low and a missing feedback between the water resource and the Cape Town community was highlighted. The collapse of water resources (?Day Zero?) was averted through a combination of government and community group led measures, incorporating both local ecosystem (green-loop) and non-local ecosystem (red-loop) forms of water resource management, and increased rainfall returning to the area. Additional disaster management plans proposed by the municipality included the tighter integration of red and green-loop water management approaches, which acted to foster a stronger connection between the Cape Town community and their water resources. We advocate the wider development and application of the RL-GL model, theoretically and empirically, to investigate missing feedbacks between water resources and their communities. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The stripping of bark from young timber trees by wild cervids is of commercial concern in many parts of Fennoscandia. We review the occurrence of this habit in moose (Alces alces) in relation to region, forestry practices, site productivity, and quality of available forage in the vicinity of areas with bark stripping. The greatest commercial loss from bark stripping is seen in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), with lesser impacts on Norway spruce (Picea abies). In stands of young Scots pine subject to bark stripping, generally less than 5% of trees are affected each year. In central Sweden, the damage to pine is confined to sapling stands 1.5-4 m tall, but to the north older trees in 'thinning-stage stands' are also frequently barked. Bark stripping in central Sweden occurs primarily during spring, while in the north it occurs throughout the year with a higher frequency in mid- to late winter. Bark stripping of Norway spruce has previously occurred only to a small extent, but in the past decade it has increased in importance in parts of southern Fennoscandia. In these new occurrences there is an apparent association with areas of high acidification from anthropogenic sources. Various authors have suggested why cervids seek tree bark, particularly red deer (Cervus elaphus). For moose, however, no single hypothesis has been verified. Possible mechanisms inducing bark stripping are discussed here, including the role of nutrient deficiencies in moose. Finally, methods for reducing bark stripping damage by moose are discussed.

AB  - Conservation aquaculture offers important tools to secure sustainable animal supplies for human use. However, intensive aquaculture practices are increasingly raising concerns about the welfare conditions of farmed animals, which typically face high mortality rates due to diseases, cannibalism, and aggression. Here we focus on the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), an economically and ecologically important decapod species that has been subjected to conservation programs for decades. While standard husbandry procedures typically result into large numbers of juvenile lobsters produced and released, it remains poorly known whether such standard settings alter the development of behavioural and life-history traits of ecological importance for the animals to survive in the wild. Here, we investigate whether the size of the individual holding spaces affects the behavioural traits (exploration, space use, and sheltering) and growth (carapace length, intermoult period, and percentage moult increment) of juvenile lobsters during their early benthic stages. Our results offer solid evidence that rearing lobsters into small holding spaces not only limits and slows down their overall growth, but also compromises the development of ecologically-relevant behaviours that are essentials for these animals to survive in a complex and risky environment. We point the attention toward the benefits of adopting better rearing procedures to improve the welfare conditions of hatchery-cultured lobsters that can, in turn, result into faster growth rates and the development of competent behavioural repertoires of these valuable organisms-likely to improve the effectiveness of conservation programs.

AB  - Worldwide, there is growing reliance in forest politics on public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a means for forest-environmental protection. In Sweden, such partnership characterizes the approach in nature conservation agreements (NCAs) in the forest policy from 1993 and onwards. NCAs are negotiated between the County Administrative Board/the Forest Agency and a landowner, where the landowner agrees to, with some compensation, provide a public service in terms of protecting biodiversity. However, assessments of the implementation of NCAs show rather inefficient implementation of set goals in general, even if there are great regional variations. This paper explores factors affecting the establishment of PPPs in two neighboring counties distinguished by high and low level of goal achievement of NCAs respectively. The analysis focuses on the process among the landowners and responsible authorities, their incentives for collaboration, and the potential for developing shared motives. The results suggest that in particular the discretionary power of authorities influences not only the willingness to participate, but also the institutional ability to develop sustainable relationships which largely explains why landowners in some counties are keener to engage in NCAs.

AB  - Boom corridor thinning (BCT) is a harvester's working method, primarily suitable for dense, unmanaged young stands. The method was first studied in Sweden in the early 2000s. In Finland, the idea has been further developed and studied for Finnish forests. The advantage is in the corridor, where the harvester head can move more swiftly, and there is no need to identify trees to grow as much as when using the traditional selective thinning (Sel) method. Moreover, the method can be conducted without cost-intensive pre-clearing of undergrowth, creating post-stands with higher biodiversity. This study is the sequel to a previous study in which experiments on BCT and Sel were established in 2017-2018. The experiments were remeasured 4-5 years after their establishment, and the effect of BCT treatments of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) on the post-treatment growth and growth reaction of individual trees within the treatments was compared to traditional Sel. During the post-treatment period, BCT did not result in growth or yield losses compared to Sel. Within the treatments, the increment of trees at the edge of strip roads or corridors was higher than that of trees located in the middle of strip roads and/or corridors. A longer post-treatment period needs to be studied to analyse the effect of BCT on the total yield and especially the yield of saw logs during the rest of the rotation period.

AB  - The oil and gas industry is expected to develop and restructure into a sustainable energy industry. This in-depth case study investigates how business model innovation can contribute to industrial restructuring. Our findings imply that, while there is no 'one size fits all' business model, most oil and gas companies will need to innovate their customer segments, value propositions, key resources, key partners and cost structures to succeed. The oil and gas industry landscape significantly influences the need for adapting the business model to changing market forces, industry forces, key trends, and macroeconomic forces pushing for sustainable change, the emergence of new technologies and markets, and changes in market conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the need for change differs from the willingness to change. The production companies' willingness to change is currently low as production is still highly profitable, while the supplier companies' willingness is high because it is not profitable to expand. Oil and gas companies will face several internal barriers in the process, including challenges with the dominant logic of the company, deficient managerial knowledge, the uncertainty and complexity of new business models and limited business model routines or processes.

AB  - Although extant research has highlighted the role of discourse in the cultural construction of organizations, there is a need to elucidate the use of narratives as central discursive resources in unfolding organizational change. Hence, the objective of this article is to develop a new kind of antenarrative approach for the cultural analysis of organizational change. We use merging multinational corporations (MNCs) as a case in point. Our empirical analysis focuses on a revelatory case: the financial services group Nordea, which was built by combining Swedish, Finnish, Danish, and Norwegian corporations. We distinguish three types of antenarrative that provided alternatives for making sense of the merger: globalist, nationalist, and regionalist (Nordic) antenarratives. We focus on how these antenarratives were mobilized in intentional organizational storytelling to legitimate or resist change: globalist storytelling as a means to legitimate the merger and to create MNC identity, nationalist storytelling to relegitimate national identities and interests, Nordic storytelling to create regional identity, and the critical use of the globalist storytelling to challenge the Nordic identity. We conclude that organizational storytelling is characterized by polyphonic, stylistic, chronotopic, and architectonic dialogisms and by a dynamic between centering and decentering forces. This paper contributes to discourse-cultural studies of organizations by explaining how narrative constructions of identities and interests are used to legitimate or resist change. Furthermore, this analysis elucidates the dialogical dynamics of organizational storytelling and thereby opens up new avenues for the cultural analysis of organizations.

AB  - To achieve effective management and understanding of risks associated with increasing anthropogenic pressures in the ocean, it is essential to successfully and efficiently collect data with high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are an example of technological advances with potential to provide improved information on ocean processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of a low -power AUV buoyancy glider for performing long endurance biological and environmental data acquisition in Northern Norway. We deployed a passive acoustic sensor system onboard a SeagliderTM to investigate presence and distribution of cetaceans while concurrently using additional onboard sensors for recording environmental features (temperature, salinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a). The hydrophone recorded over 108.6 h of acoustic data during the spring months of March and April across the continental shelf break and detected both baleen and odontocete species. We observed a change in cetacean detections throughout the survey period, with humpback whale calls dominating the soundscape in the first weeks of deployment, coinciding with the migration toward their breeding grounds. From mid-April, sperm whales and delphinids were the predominant species, which coincided with increasing chlorophyll a fluorescence values associated with the spring phytoplankton blooms. Finally, we report daily variations in background noise associated with fishing activities and traffic in the nearby East Atlantic shipping route. Our results show that gliders provide excellent platforms for collecting information about ecosystems with minimal disturbance to animals, allowing systematic observations of our ocean biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in response to natural variations and industrial activities.

AB  - After 25 years of introducing beech into pure Norway spruce forests some foresters, economists, but also forest scientists are concerned about the increasing proportion of beech. We therefore reviewed the existing literature on the ecological and economic consequences of an enrichment of Norway spruce stands by beech. From this review it can be concluded that, though generalisations are difficult, beech improves soil properties, biodiversity, and productivity of pure spruce forests in many cases. Moreover, recent financial considerations revealed new and tangible arguments for the replacement of pure stands of Norway spruce by mixtures of Norway spruce and beech. In addition, introducing beech or other broad leaved species into Norway spruce stands is strongly recommended because of the high vulnerability of the latter species against climate change.
   In the second section of the paper we refer to silvicultural strategies for the conversion of Norway spruce stands and discuss the relevant techniques, planting and direct seeding. Factors which may affect the success of planting and direct seeding of beech are summarised.
   We conclude that converting pure spruce stands into mixed ones by the introduction of broadleaved tree species such as beech is still a sound option and that there are cost effective methods to realize this. However, the decision in favour of a substantial percentage of beech should not be hampered by the demand of conservationists to ban forestry from beech forests by arguing that these forests represent the natural vegetation type in Central Europe.

AB  - Supplemental feeding of cervids during winter is a widespread management practice, but feeding may increase the risk of disease transmission. Therefore, legal regulations to limit supplemental feeding are often implemented when dealing with severe infectious diseases, such as chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. However, it is currently unclear whether these regulations result in decreased spatial clustering and aggregation as intended. Supplemental feeding is expected to restrict the movement of cervids. Therefore, a ban on feeding may also result in wider space use and a risk of geographic spread of disease. The space use of 63 GPS-marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) was investigated before (n = 34) and after (n = 29) the implementation of a legal regulation aimed at limiting the supplemental feeding of cervids during winter in a CWD-affected region of Nordfjella, Norway. Snow depth was the main determinant of the space use for red deer. A moderate reduction in the number of GPS positions in spatial clusters was evident during periods of deep snow once the ban was in place. Sizes of core areas (Kernel 50%), home ranges (Kernel 95%), and dispersion (MCP 100%, number of 1 km(2) pixels visited per deer) declined from January to March and with increasing snow depth. Dispersion (number of 1 km(2) pixels visited per deer) did not depend on snow depth after the ban, and red deer used larger areas when snow depth was high after the ban compared to before. The ban on supplementary feeding had no effect on size of core areas or home ranges. Several potential factors can explain the overall weak effect of the ban on space use, including the use of agricultural fields by red deer, other anthropogenic feeding, and landscape topography. This study highlights that snow depth is the main factor determining space use during winter, and it remains to be determined whether the moderate reduction in spatial clustering during deep snow after the ban was sufficient to lower the risk of disease transmission.

AB  - For the evaluation of changes in the carbon stock of living biomass, two methods are reported in the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry: (1) the default method, which requires the biomass carbon loss to be subtracted from the biomass carbon increment for the reporting year; and (2) the stock change method, which requires two consecutive biomass carbon stock inventories for a given forest area at two points in time. We used three methods to estimate above-ground biomass: (1) application of allometric equations, (2) constant BEF (biomass expansion factor), and (3) age-dependent BEF, following which we evaluated the changes in carbon stock and the related uncertainty. Our study was carried out in a Douglas fir plantation composed of plots with three different planting densities, monitored at three different ages (15, 25, and 40 years old). Results showed the highest uncertainty in the estimates based on the constant BEF, whereas the use of allometric equations led to the lowest uncertainty in the estimates. With a constant BEF, it is usually difficult to obtain a reliable value for the whole tree biomass because stem proportion increases with tree size at the expense of the other components. The age-dependent BEFs aim to reduce the bias representing the actual change in stock, thus we found a lower uncertainty in the estimates by using this method compared to the constant BEF. The default method had the highest uncertainty (35.5-48.1%) and gave an estimate higher by almost double compared to the stock change method, which had an uncertainty ranging from 2.9% (estimated by the allometric equation) to 3.4% (estimated by the constant BEF).

AB  - Current EU policy calls for decreased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by i.e., replacing fossil fuel in the transportation sector with sustainable biofuels. To avoid indirect land use change (iLUC), the EU at the same time strives to limit the use of crops and to increase the use of residues. In this study we compare climate impact and production cost for biogas and ethanol based on wheat grain and straw, respectively, in a Swedish context. The economic competitiveness for ethanol from straw vs. grain is evaluated based on the mandatory emission reduction for fossil vehicle fuels implemented since July 2018 in Sweden. The result of this study clearly shows that biogas and ethanol from straw have the lowest GHG emissions regardless of the calculation method used, although biofuels from grain also fulfill EU GHG reduction criteria even when suggested iLUC factors are included. It was also shown that the cost of producing straw-based biofuels was higher, thus there is a trade-off between climate impact and costs. The GHG reduction mandate adopted in Sweden partly compensates for this, but is not enough to make ethanol from straw competitive from an economic perspective.

AB  - This paper discusses the ecology of species that were favoured by the development of the cultural landscape in central and NW Europe beginning in the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, with a focus on mechanisms behind species responses to this landscape transformation. A fraction of species may have maintained their realized niches from the pre- agricultural landscape and utilized similar niches created by the landscape transformation. However, I suggest that many species responded by altering their niche relationships, and a conceptual model is proposed for this response, based on niche construction, ecological opportunity and niche shifts. Human-mediated niche construction, associated with clearing of forests and creation of pastures and fields promoted niche shifts towards open habitats, and species exploited the ecological opportunity provided by these created environments. This process was initially purely ecological, i.e. the new habitats must have been included in the original fundamental niche of the species. Two other features of human-mediated niche construction, increased interconnectivity and increased spatial stability of open habitats, resulted in species accumulating in the habitats of the constructed landscape. As a consequence, selection processes were initiated favouring traits promoting fitness in the constructed landscape. This process implied a feed-back to niche shifts, but now also including evolutionary changes in fundamental niches. I briefly discuss whether this model can be applied also to present-day anthropogenic impact on landscapes. A general conclusion is that ecological and evolutionary changes in species niches should be more explicitly considered in modeling and predictions of species response to present-day landscape and land-use changes.

AB  - Negative effects of habitat fragmentation (increased isolation and reduced habitat sine) affected presence of several beetle species inhabiting Fomes fomentarius; (L.) Kicks basidiocarps in a fragmented forest landscape. At the scale of individual trees (tree level), incidence of Cia jacquemarti Mell./C. nitidus) (F.) (not distinguished between individuals of these two species, abbreviated C. jacquemarti Mell./C. bidentatus (Ol.), C. lineatocribratus Mell., Ennearthron cornutum (Gyll.) (all Coleoptera, Cisidae) and Dorcatoma dresdensis Herbst (Coleoptera, Anobiidae) was reduced with increased habitat isolation and reduced habitat size. Additionally, increased habitat size at a larger scale (forest island level) also gave higher incidence of all species.
   Some of the microhabitat variables measured influenced upon the presence of the study species. Fallen trees had a higher probability of C. jacquemarti/nitidus presence than standing trees, whilst the opposite was the case for C. bidentatus. There was also increased incidence of C. bidentatus on trees in denser forests and of E. cornutum grey alder Alnus incana compared with birch trees (Betula spp.). Increased volume of basidiocarps on a tree resulted in a higher number of individuals of C. jacquemarti/nitidus and C. lineatocribratus.

AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) spectral data were obtained from 165 surface sediment samples from a northern Swedish humic, mesotrophic lake (0.5 km(2)). The NIR spectra, together with data on water depth and loss-on-ignition (LOI), allow an evaluation of the source of spatial variance in sediment characteristics. The results show that water depth and organic matter (LOI) account for 20 and 16%, respectively, of the variance in the NIR-absorbance data. More importantly, the spatial variance in the spectral data suggest that NIR analysis of lake sediments mainly reflect sediment properties that cannot simply be explained by depth or amount of organic matter. The influence of inlets and land-use (e.g, clear-cutting) on sediment characteristics was more pronounced in the spectral data than would be expected from the LOI data. This is explained by differences in the chemical composition of the organic matter, as revealed by NIR spectroscopy, rather than in the amount of organic matter or depth-related sedimentation properties (e.g. particle size or density). This initial attempt to characterise sediment properties using NIR suggests that NIR analysis might become a valuable complementary tool to traditional sediment characterisation.

AB  - The Salek valley used to be exposed to huge amounts of pollutants due to its close vicinity to the largest Slovene thermal power plant of Sostanj (STPP). Due to large emissions of SO2 and heavy metals as well as dumping of fly ash negative effects on the environment appeared (e.g. forest decline in area exposed to deposition of emission by the STPP, pollution of lake Velenje and the river Paka). Therefore, several ecological remediation measures on the STPP were implemented in the 1990s, and several research projects on reasons and effects of forest decline and degradation of environment began as well. A continuous and marked improving of the condition of both forest and freshwater ecosystems (of lake Velenje and the river Paka) after the installation of desulphurization devices on Units 4 and 5 of the STPP and construction of a closed loop system for the ash transportation is emphasized in the present paper.

AB  - Worldwide use of bioenergy for the substitution of fossil fuels in power generation is expected to increase in the near-to-medium term as a means of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study examined the potential for new large scale (greater than or equal to30MW) electric power production at a global scale using forest by-products derived from sustainable production forestry.
   The study assessed the forestry industries of five industrialised countries (Canada, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand and USA) as representative of the industrialised nations and from this analysis extrapolated projections for the likely contribution from forestry resources in all developed countries. The study established a potential additional generation capacity of 200 to 276 TWh/y of electric power. This would avoid GHG emissions of between 116 and 178 Mt CO2 e/y if compared to comparable power production from 500 MWe coal fired power stations. In addition, the costs of mitigation are compared to potential quantities of GHG emissions that could be avoided in a series of mitigation cost curves for four regions of the world.

AB  - At the beginning of the last century European landscapes were a mosaic of open and forested habitats formed by centuries of human use. During the 20th century, however, this mosaic was altered. Changes in grazing pressure from domestic animals have been suggested as one of the drivers of these alterations. This paper presents a methodology developed to calculate an index of potential grazing pressure change at the landscape level. Information about location, type and number of grazing animals is used to produce detailed Geographical Information System (GIS) maps of potential grazing pressure change. Spatial information from these maps can then be geographically linked to vegetation maps such that the effect of grazing pressure changes on vegetation can be statistically analyzed. This methodology was applied to a Norwegian mountain landscape to test if decreased grazing pressure by domestic animals leads to woodland establishment in open habitats. Canonical Correspondence Analyzes (CCA) were performed and the results showed significant effects. Decreased grazing pressure increased the probability of woodland establishment in heathlands. The methodology described in this paper might be a useful tool in planning strategies both for conservation efforts and sustainable resource use. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A recent hypothesis, the habitat amount hypothesis, predicts that the total amount of habitat in the landscape can replace habitat patch size and isolation in studies of species richness in fragmented landscapes.
   To test the habitat amount hypothesis by first evaluating at which spatial scale the relationship between species richness in equal-sized sample quadrats and habitat amount was the strongest, and then test the importance of spatial configuration of habitat-measured as local patch size and isolation-when habitat amount was taken into account.
   A quasi-experimental setup with 20 habitat patches of dry calcareous grasslands varying in patch size, patch isolation and habitat amount at the landscape scale was established in the inner Oslo fjord, Southern Norway. We recorded species richness of habitat specialists of vascular plants in equal-sized sample quadrats and analysed the relationship between species richness, habitat amount in the landscape and patch size and isolation.
   Although the total amount of habitat in a 3 km-radius around the local patch was positively related to species richness in the sample quadrats, local patch size had an additional positive effect, and the effect of patch size was higher when the amount of habitat within the 3 km-radius was high than when it was low.
   In our study system of specialist vascular plants in dry calcareous grasslands, we do not find support for the habitat amount hypothesis.

AB  - Because the amount of urban areas has increased, it is important to investigate the abundance of wildlife species in relation to urban environments. Analyzing the impact of urbanization on the presence of forest-dwelling mammals is of interest due to the possible effects of urbanization on human-wildlife relationships and urban biodiversity. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a declining forest species, and its occurrence in urban environments has been inadequately studied. The loss and fragmentation of forests due to urbanization may be detrimental for squirrels, whereas the abundant and predictable food resources and the low number of natural predators in urban areas may encourage squirrels to invade towns. We used large-scale data collected by volunteer bird watchers along a 950 km south-north gradient to study whether the winter abundance of squirrels in Finland is dependent on urbanization, while controlling for effects of habitat type, food abundance (spruce cone crop; number of winter feeding sites), predator abundance (northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis; feral cat Felis catus), season and latitude. We found that squirrel abundance increased with human population density, number of feeding sites and spruce cone crop and decreased with latitude and season. Feral cats showed weak negative connection with squirrel numbers, but there were no effect of goshawks. Relative squirrel abundance was approximately twice as high in urban habitats than in forests. Artificial feeding rather than a low number of predators may attract squirrels in urban environments. Planting spruce trees in urban environments will also benefit squirrels. Our results indicate that urban areas are an important habitat for the red squirrel even along the northern edge of their distribution range, where natural forest areas are still widespread. We conclude also that a citizen science - based bird survey protocol associated with mammal surveys seems to be a good large-scale monitoring method to study the urbanization of squirrels.

AB  - We apply a bioeconomic production function approach to fisheries and habitats, to assess consequences of exogenous habitat loss, for both open access and optimal management. We find that habitat levels matter under optimal management, as they directly impact upon profits, and habitat degradation impacts upon profits disproportionally more at low habitat levels. Using time-series data from Icelandic redfish fisheries and assumptions of cold water coral decline, we estimate parameters for the model and indicate potential losses for open access and optimal management. The results support the theoretical predictions, underlining the importance of taking into account habitat-fisheries interactions.

AB  - Inland waters transport and emit into the atmosphere large amounts of carbon (C), which originates from terrestrial ecosystems. The effect of land cover and land-use practises on C export from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters is not fully understood, especially in heterogeneous landscapes under human influence. We sampled for dissolved C species in five tributaries with well-determined subcatchments (total size 174.5km(2)), as well as in various points of two of the subcatchments draining to a boreal lake in southern Finland over a full year. Our aim was to find out how land cover and land-use affect C export from the catchments, as well as CH4 and CO2 concentrations of the streams, and if the origin of C in stream water can be determined from proxies for quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We further estimated the gas evasion from stream surfaces and the role of aquatic fluxes in regional C cycling. The export rate of C from the terrestrial system through an aquatic conduit was 19.3g Cm-2(catchment)yr(-1), which corresponds to 19% of the estimated terrestrial net ecosystem exchange of the catchment. Most of the C load to the recipient lake consisted of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 6.1 +/- 1.0g Cm(-2)yr(-1)); the share of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was much smaller (1.0 +/- 0.2g Cm(-2)yr(-1)). CO2 and CH4 emissions from stream and ditch surfaces were 7.0 +/- 2.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) and 0.1 +/- 0.04g Cm(-2)yr(-1), respectively, C emissions being thus equal with C load to the lake. The proportion of peatland in the catchment and the drainage density of peatland increased DOC in streams, whereas the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment decreased it. The opposite was true for DIC. Drained peatlands were an important CH4 source for streams.

AB  - This article reviews the emerging phenomena of electric buses' deployment in Europe and Belarus within the general framework of the concept of sustainable and electric urban mobility. The author offers a brief overview of electric bus technologies available on the market and a spatial analysis of fleet deployment in Europe. The analysis of the spatial structure of the distribution of e-buses in Europe indicated that, in terms of the number of vehicles in operation, the UK and the Netherlands are the regional leaders, while in terms of the number of cities testing e-buses - Germany, Sweden, and Poland are the leaders. The analysis showed that the main factors supporting the distribution of innovative technology and public support are legislative and regulative framework as well as clear strategic planning and cooperation between local administrations and transportation authorities. Other important aspects, such as network building features, and the location of the charging infrastructure were also discussed. The analysis of the case study of Minsk (the first city to introduce electric buses in Belarus) outlined the typical limiting factors for all types of markets: high battery costs and dependency on infrastructure; recommendations are given to emphasise bus fleet replacement (instead of trolleybus) and to develop a comprehensive sustainable urban mobility strategy.

TI  - BORDER CONTROL AND EARLY SOVIET STATEHOOD: The Case of the Soviet-Finnish Frontier in the 1920s*
T2  - AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA  - English
AB  - Oksana Ermolaeva's article discusses the creation of the Soviet-Finnish border during the first postrevolutionary decade as well as sociopolitical processes in the Soviet borderland. All forms of social interaction in the zone adjacent to the Soviet-Finnish border - population mobility, economic transactions, cross-cultural influences - are regarded as markers of domestic processes of early Soviet state-building. In the article, the concept of the border is used simultaneously as a mirror reflecting the emerging Soviet state and as a magnifying glass helping to better discern some aspects of this process. Until the late 1920s, the borderline remained not simply "porous" or "traversable," but "situational." Illegal cross-border traffic was caused by the new state border cutting through established economic ties and even more so by the flight of numerous borderland residents to Finland in the wake of the Civil War. Some of the refugees returned to the USSR under the terms of an amnesty that threatened to confiscate the land and property of those who stayed abroad. Families split up, delegating some of their members to return to the Soviet side to claim the family property. The separated families and whole borderland communities could sustain communication only through illegal transborder contacts. As locals, they knew how and where to cross the border while managing to avoid the border guards. Professional contrabandists, political activists, and spies relied on this local knowledge, and thus contributed to illegal transborder traffic.

AB  - The aim of this research was to quantify the content of hazardous elements in the needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) in the natural habitats that were accumulated from thermal power plants, mines, and metal processing industry. Fifteen natural populations of the Norway spruce were sampled from the mountain ranges in Southeastern Europe (Dinaric Alps and Balkan Mountains). Two-year-old spruce needles were evaluated the content of the following hazardous elements: heavy metals cadmium, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc, and metalloid arsenic. The effect of the distance between air pollution emitters and the Norway spruce natural habitats on the hazardous elements content in needles was also evaluated. The results of the analysis of variance confirmed interpopulation differences in the content of all analyzed hazardous elements. The effect of the air pollution source (thermal power plants, mines, and industry) on the content of hazardous elements in the spruce needles was also assessed. Significant correlation was found between the distance of air pollution emitters and the amount of zinc. This study could serve as the startup point of future monitoring programs and provide new prospect of using Norway spruce needles as the bioindicator of air pollution with hazardous elements on Balkan Peninsula since the fact that the Norway spruce natural populations inhabit wide geographic range of the continental Europe, from the Balkan Peninsula, over European Alps to Scandinavia and a large-scale of altitude from 980 to 1860 m above sea level.

AB  - Salmon production, and aquaculture in general, entails certain environmental risks that must be managed and controlled. In Norway, as in other aquaculture-producing countries, governments seek means of improving the industry and encouraging sustainable conduct. In Norwegian aquaculture regulation, the salmon louse has become an important indicator and regulatory instrument - a governmental technology. The louse is a proxy for the environmental impact of the industry and as a governmental technology, it is used to regulate and incite behavior. In this paper, we draw on results from both interviews and an analysis of responses to a consultation round for a governmental White Paper proposing new means for regulating the growth of the aquaculture industry. Based on these results, we investigate the becoming of the salmon louse as a regulatory instrument, and how this is perceived among relevant stakeholders. The political significance of the salmon louse serves to illuminate how a governmental technology is created to instill control from a distance. The history of how the salmon louse has become a governable object additionally elucidates disagreements and uncertainties surrounding modern salmon farming and demonstrates that the creation of governmental technologies persists in the face of resistance.

AB  - A model network comprising climate models, a hydrological model, a catchment-scale model for phosphorus biogeochemistry, and a lake thermodynamics and plankton dynamics model was used to simulate phosphorus loadings, total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations in Lake Vansjo, Southern Norway. The model network was automatically calibrated against time series of hydrological, chemical and biological observations in the inflowing river and in the lake itself using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Climate projections from three global climate models (GCM: HadRM3, ECHAM5r3 and BCM) were used. The GCM model HadRM3 predicted the highest increase in temperature and precipitation and yielded the highest increase in total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations in the lake basin over the scenario period of 2031-2060. Despite the significant impact of climate change on these aspects of water quality, it is minimal when compared to the much larger effect of changes in land-use. The results suggest that implementing realistic abatement measures will remain a viable approach to improving water quality in the context of climate change.

AB  - This article begins with a look at the nature and development, in the period 1970-1992, of the trade of each of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe with the twelve countries of the EEC, with the five principal member countries of EFTA - Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland - and six countries of the Mediterranean basin - Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey. This is followed by a table of the regional trade of each of the EEC countries, based on indices for the comparative rate of their bilateral trade. This table gives a somewhat different picture of the trade in question from that afforded by a study of the individual trade figures for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In conclusion, an effort is made to show how the special features of geographical, historical and indeed cultural proximity which influence the trade of these countries with their ''natural partners'' are taken into account in economic literature. In our case, it is done through the presentation of weighting models applied to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. These models show that there exists a growth potential for trade between Western and Eastern Europe, which has for a long time been hampered by the system of the planned economy.

AB  - In May 2010, Indonesia signed a $1-billion partnership with Norway to reduce deforestation and prepare for a global REDD+ scheme (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation). A pillar of the pact is a moratorium on new agricultural and logging licenses in similar to 535,294 km2 of species-rich dryland forest and similar to 153,984 km2 of carbon-rich peatlands. A critical question is whether these moratorium areas constitute "additional" conservation. We test whether dryland forests and peatlands within moratorium areas differ from unprotected forest and recently cleared forest on a range of biophysical, economic, and agricultural attributes indicative of forest threat. Compared to other forests, dryland moratorium forests are significantly more marginal economically, less physically accessible, more removed from forest disruption, and more sheltered from encroachment, such that their "conservation" achieves little additional prevention of forest loss and carbon emissions. Peatland moratorium areas are, however, a conservation success insofar as they are indistinguishable from unprotected peatland and encompass the majority of remaining peatland area, much of which is vulnerable to future conversion.

AB  - There is growing evidence that biodiversity is important for ecosystem functions. Thus, identification of habitat requirements essential for current species richness and abundance to persist is crucial. Hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are biodiversity hot spots for deadwood-dependent insect species, and the main objective of this paper was to test the effect of habitat history and current habitat distribution at various spatial scales on the associated beetle community. We used a gradient spanning 40 km from the coast to inland areas reflecting historical logging intensity (later and lower intensities inland) through 500 years in Southern Norway, to investigate whether the historical variation in oak density is influencing the structure of beetle communities in hollow oaks today. We trapped beetles in 32 hollow oaks along this gradient in forested and seminatural landscapes over two summers. We found higher species richness and total abundance inland consistent with our expectation based on historic logging intensity. Scale-specific environmental variables also affected the response; beetle abundances were controlled by local conditions, whereas beetle species richness responded to habitat on the landscape scale. This indicates that long time continuity as well as large areas of favorable habitat is necessary to maintain beetle species richness through time in these highly long-lasting structures.

AB  - This article deals with willingness to pay (WTP) for nature as a public good. The study addresses the relationships between motivation for nature-based experiences, environmental engagement, involvement with nature experiences, relationship with nature, preferred degree of adaptation of nature and consumers' WTP. The aim was to identify factors that influence WTP for nature-based tourist experiences. The study relies on quantitative survey data from 1,634 respondents in Norway. The data were analyzed using SPSS. WTP varies according to factors such as escape, recognition, active achievement, esthetics, social and environmental concern, preference for adaptation, and type of natural surroundings. Tourists who place importance on, for example, peer recognition and escape, have a higher WTP for nature that is not overcrowded and with little or no adaptation for tourism purposes. The article discusses practical issues such as how WTP should affect management decisions about the pricing of nature tourism, and presents the theoretical and practical implications of the results.

AB  - The rapid market uptake of battery and hybrid electric cars in Norway is unparalleled. We examine the fiscal policy instruments behind this development. In essence, the Norwegian policy consists in taxing internal combustion engine vehicles rather than subsidizing electric ones. There are 14 different fiscal incentives in place bearing on vehicles, fuel, or road use. All of them are in some way CO2-differentiated. In the tradition of positive economics, we derive the price of carbon implicit in each policy instrument and in the total package of taxes and subsidies. The price of carbon characterizing the trade-off between conventional and battery electric cars in Norway as of 2019 exceeds euro1370 per ton of CO2. For light and heavy-duty commercial vehicles the corresponding prices have been conservatively estimated at euro640 and euro200 per ton of CO2, respectively. In addition, the penalty incurred by automakers for not meeting their 2020/2021 target under EU Regulation 2019/631 corresponds to a carbon price of the order of euro340 per ton of CO2. As compared to the price of emission allowances in the European cap-and-trade system, the price of carbon paid by automakers and Norwegian motorists is one or two orders of magnitude higher.

AB  - Tourism is recognized as a potential development mechanism for peripheral rural communities encountering various changes and challenges. However, a relatively unexplored theme in previous studies is that tourism's potential benefits to rural communities are affected by rural development policies and practices: specifically, a collaborative governance approach. Based on a case study from Vuonislahti, a peripheral locale in the municipality of Lieksa, Finland, this article frames a community tourism collaborative governance approach. The study suggests that the village community receives limited tourism benefits because of various constraints rooted in the specific socioeconomic and institutional settings of the village and beyond. However, the struggle to formulate a fair and effective community tourism collaborative governance approach may bring positive socioeconomic benefits to the village and to other similarly declining rural communities in Finland and beyond. The approach is conceptually tentative in nature and its theoretical development needs to be complemented with additional research findings from empirical case studies conducted in diverse rural socioeconomic and institutional contexts of countries under different regimes.

AB  - Aim Human land use, especially urbanization, might homogenize the world's biota. The objective of this study is to find out if urbanization homogenizes wintering bird communities, and if habitat type affects the spatial variation of urban bird communities across spatial scales.
   Location We compared the quantitative similarity of winter bird communities between town centres, apartment block areas and single-family house areas across regional and local scales in five towns in northern Finland.
   Methods The wintering birds were surveyed using a single-visit study plot (30 ha) method in January and February 2001. The validity of single-visit and single-year data was confirmed by using data from several-visit surveys and multi-year data set. The level of urbanization was measured according to the number of inhabitants and general structure of the habitat.
   Results Temporal variability in species richness and total number of individuals was low, both between winters and within winter. Bird community similarity between different habitat types within a single town was about the same as that in similar habitats in different towns. At the regional scale, bird community similarity between town centres (30%) was lower than between areas of apartment blocks (54%) or between areas of single-family houses (54%). We detected a threshold point between towns of 35,000 and 105,000 inhabitants and between town sizes of 5.0-8.5 km in diameter where human impact causes marked changes in bird community structure. At the local scale, bird community similarity level between apartment block areas (49%) and single-family house areas (62%) were about the same. Passer domesticus, Parus major and Pica pica dominated the bird communities in residential areas. Different habitat factors affected bird species abundances on the local and regional scales.
   Conclusions Urbanization cannot be seen as a process that monotonically increases the similarity of bird communities. Our results indicate that the similarity between urban bird communities is dependent on the size of the town, location of the study site within the town and especially the local habitat structure. Because different habitat factors affected bird species abundances, it is difficult to extrapolate bird-habitat relationships derived from one scale to other scales. In wintertime, single-family house areas are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Therefore, it is especially important to understand the factors affecting the occurrence of birds in the single-family house area in order to maintain or even increase diversity on winter birds in other urban habitats.

AB  - Arguably the most powerful artifact of the 20th century, the private car brought profound spatial, social, and cultural changes, as well as wide-ranging mobility justice implications. Autonomous mobility technologies, with the power to supplant part or all of the action of the driver by collecting and processing large quantities of fine grained data, promise to shift power away from users to engineers and create new important spatial and social implications for mobility justice, of which little are known. This research draws from Foucauldian conceptualizations adapted for the study of geographies of power to investigate how autonomous mobility technology may diagram spatial rationalities and moralities into the built environment. To that effect, it draws from 30 interviews of intermediaries in Finland-a country actively pursuing a transition to automated and shared mobility as part of an ICT-driven innovation policy. Examining autonomous mobility through a Foucauldian lens helps highlight the complex power relations it affords-in terms of changes in social structure and infrastructure, and social justice. By shedding light on how technology may structure the built environment, the Foucauldian perspective shows itself to be a valuable tool for planning and policymaking, providing insight into how autonomous mobility (in)justice may be assembled.

AB  - The proper development of transportation constitutes the basis for an effectively functioning economy at the national and global levels. On the other hand, transportation significantly impacts the environment and climate. Sustainable transportation management should therefore include both economic, social and environmental aspects. The article aims to comprehensively assess the economic-energy-environmental efficiency of the 27-road freight transport sector in EU countries in 2019. The research was conducted using the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. The Slacks-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) model was used, taking into account unwanted (undesirable) effects. As non-energy inputs in the DEA model used the labor in the road freight transport sector, stock of registered goods vehicles, and the length of the road network. Moreover, the energy consumption by the road freight transport sector was used as energy inputs in the DEA model. Desirable outputs were taken as road freight transport sector revenues and freight work performed by the sector. GHG emissions expressed in CO2 equivalent were treated as undesirable outputs. The research also adopts energy productivity and GHG emission efficiency indicators. The eco-efficiency of the road freight transport sector in EU countries varies. Ten countries have efficient road freight transport sectors. The efficient road freight transport group included Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Bulgaria. They efficiently transformed the inputs into outputs. Five countries were recognized as eco-efficiency followers, including Italy, Finland, Slovakia, Sweden and Romania, and 12 countries were characterized by an inefficient road freight transport sector. Based on benchmarking principles for inefficient road freight transport sectors, the changes in input and output levels were proposed to improve efficiency. The relationship between the economic development of EU countries and the eco-efficiency of the road freight transport sector was also analyzed, indicating a positive relationship between the variables but with weak strength. The main contributions of this article are an extension of previous DEA works that assesses the efficiency of the road freight transport sector, also considering undesirable variables. Research conclusions are particularly important for policymakers in the context of management sustainable transportation development in the EU.

AB  - Every oil producing nation is confronted with a complex and fundamental ethical dilemma. On the one hand, there are moral arguments for the nation to use the petroleum resource for the benefit of society and make it available for countries who do not have this natural resource endowment. On the other hand, there are moral arguments for not extracting and using fossil fuels because of CO2 emissions. In short, this creates tension between the need for government revenues to finance welfare benefits and the objective of preserving the environment. A complicating factor is that a nation's domestic oil and gas activities are in its nature global because the activities have a direct impact on the global climate. In this paper, I address a question that to my knowledge is rarely discussed in the business ethics literature: how does an oil producing nation try to resolve this fundamental ethical dilemma? Using Norway as a case, I argue that the nation is well aware of this ethical dilemma, but that there are few signals from the government that it wants to reduce the petroleum activities. Instead, Norway tries to seek redemption by (1) using the financial power of the Oil Fund to promote sustainability issues abroad and (2) building an international brand as an "Environmentally Conscious Energy Nation."

AB  - This article describes the results of a feedback system designed to improve performance for a Swedish traffic police unit and examined whether such a feedback system was beneficial or detrimental to the attitudes of the officers. As in many Western countries, government organizations are being required to demonstrate their effectiveness with quantitative performance measures. An approach called the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System (ProMES) was used with three groups of Swedish Traffic Police to do this. ProMES is a method for identifying unit's objectives, developing measures for these objectives, and using this information as feedback. ProMES was developed with these police units and feedback from the system was used over a four-year period. Results indicate that there were substantial increases in performance. There were also decreases in accidents, injuries, and fatalities compared both to baseline and to comparison groups in Sweden. These improvements were made with fewer and fewer police officers each year. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A circular economy (CE) represents the key alternative to the linear 'take-make-consume-dispose' economic model, that still predominates in the construction sector. This study investigates how policies support CE-focused businesses in the construction sector in the Nordics. A literature review, the creation of a database, a review of Nordic actors with a CE focus, and targeted interviews with actors across the value chain of the construction sector in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden enabled us to benchmark the CE policy landscape and assess how CE policies at different levels support CE business models in the construction sector. The results show that the construction sector is well represented in the CE policy frameworks and that many business opportunities are created when national and local policies are put into practice. The implementation of policies is mainly done via three key concepts, i.e., planning, requirements for sustainable constructions, and requirements for public procurement. It can be concluded that policies are drivers for the implementation of a CE and support CE business models in the Nordics.

AB  - This paper presents the approach chosen by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration as a way of obtaining more practical acceptance criteria for recycled materials in road construction. The approach is based on a combination of the European standard for characterization of waste, ENV 12920, and Guidelines for evaluating impact on health and ecosystem; SFT 99:01, issued by the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. The possibility of using generalized default assumptions contrary to site-specific data is the key issue. Norwegian conditions concerning natural resources and waste are described with the aim of pointing out major differences from European countries that have achieved high recycling levels. Traditionally, Norway is not a typical "recycling country", especially in regards to the recycling of construction and demolition waste. One reason for the low level of recycling in this area is the abundance of high quality and relatively low cost natural aggregates. Another reason is that ambitious environmental policy sets high standards for pollution control and raises concern regarding potential damage caused by long-term leaching. However, implementation of uniform acceptance criteria according the methods described may increase the rate of recycled materials use in road construction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Air quality in Nur-Sultan, the fast-growing new capital city of Kazakhstan, has been poorly investigated. This research was carried in Kerey and Janibek Khans Park in Nur-Sultan, the capital city of Kazakhstan, which is affected by "different traffic density" on the roads. Three different categories of contamination (i) high pollution (distance from the main road 10-15 m), (ii) moderate pollution (distance from the side road 15-30 m), and (iii) low pollution (distance from the source of contamination 30-80 m) at different levels resulting from urban transportation were examined. The aim of the study is to determine the pollution accumulation amounts of Ni, Cd, Pb, Cr, Li, Co, Fe, and Zn in five different tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies /L./ H. Karst.), blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.,), Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.), and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth). Significant differences in Ni, Cd, Pb, Cr, Li, Co, Fe, and Zn accumulation amounts were determined between three different parts of the park exposed to different levels of contamination. Approximately twice higher Ni, 2.3 times Cd, 3.3 times Pb, 2.7 times Co, 1.6 times Zn accumulation were determined in the area exposed to high pollution than in the parts of the park exposed to low pollution. Cd deposition in the area exposed to high contamination was higher in silver birch than in Scots pine and Norway spruce, while Cr and Co deposition values were higher in Norway spruce than in birch and Scots pine.

AB  - This paper analyzes how different property and landowner characteristics and other factors affect landowners' profit efficiency from salmon angling tourism. The paper helps correct a lack of studies on the economic aspects of the triple bottom line approach to sustainability and suggests new areas of rural tourism research. A stochastic profit frontier function with an inefficiency module was estimated based on survey responses from 203 landowners along four Mid-Norway rivers. Profit efficiency decreased as the revenues from off-property and on-property activities increased relative to angling tourism. Factors increasing efficiency were long-termrenting of fishing instead of permit sale or selling fishing packages with additional services and common property ownership instead of simple fee ownership. Cooperation, by merging several fishing rights into one unit rather than fishing on a single property basis, decreased efficiency. This study did not distinguish between different forms of cooperation; mandatory cooperation in the form of common property and voluntary cooperation between private properties are issues for further research. If sustainable economic efficiency is a public goal, policies should ensure a predictable economic environment for landowners specializing in salmon angling tourism and promote long- term renting, with a 10-year minimum period for the lease of fishing rights.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of how TOD can contribute to sustainable development locally and regionally in sparse settlement structures. While TOD theory focuses on large cities and densely populated areas, it also tends to be applied in less populated areas. 'Station communities' are of great interest in Sweden, given the opportunities they apparently offer to combine economic growth through regional enlargement with decreased climate impact. This idea is, in many ways, inspired by the transit-oriented development (TOD) theory, and applied in the Vastra Gotaland region, aiming for regional development and increased public transportation use. The study has examined how the conditions for TOD are met in small towns with train stations located in sparse settlement structures through a case study and semi-structured interviews. The results indicate that train stations, together with planning approaches inspired by TOD theory, are regarded as important in municipal planning when identifying future developments, although the prerequisites for TOD are absent and the demand for new housing and businesses is weak. One conclusion is that a new concept is needed that does not focus on densification and urban qualities, but draws on the place qualities, where the connections to the train stations are enforced.

AB  - A large-scale loss of the habitat-forming macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus was reported around the Baltic Sea in the 1980's, but only relatively local studies have reported its current status. We studied recent comprehensive mapping data in the Finnish marine area and compared reported Fucus occurrences in relation to its potential, to find out its current status on a larger scale. We also investigated the effects of water quality on Fucus occurrence and its depth penetration. Our results show that the status of Fucus is better in the Gulf of Bothnia than in the Gulf of Finland, both in terms of its occurrence rate and its depth distribution. Despite high potential in the outer Archipelago Sea, the status of Fucus is poor. The Fucus occurrence patterns are mainly related to salinity, exposure and Secchi depth, all positively affecting the Fucus occurrence rate and/or the lower limit of the Fucus zone.

AB  - Black shale is often rich in sulfides and trace elements, and is thus a potential environmental threat in a manner similar to acid sulfate soils and active or abandoned sulfide mines. This study aims at characterising how exposed and processed (mined and burnt) black shale (alum shale) in Degerhamn, SE Sweden, affects the chemistry (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Ca, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, K, Si, Na, Sr, S, U, V and Zn) of the groundwater. There were large variations in groundwater chemistry between nearby sampling points, while the temporal variations generally were small. Acidic groundwater (around pH 4), found in deposits of burnt and carbonate-poor shale where the conditions for sulfide oxidation were favourable, was strongly elevated in Al, U and several chalcophilic metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Zn). Cadmium and U were also, together with Mo, abundant in many of the near-neutral waters, both in the non-mined black shale bedrock and in the deposits of burnt shale. An extrapolation to a national level suggests that the dispersion of Ni from naturally occurring black shale is similar to that from anthropogenic point sources, while for Cd and As it is assessed to be approximately one tenth of that from point sources. The processed shale was, however, a much larger source of metals than the black shale bedrock itself, showing this material's potential as a massive supplier of metals to the aquatic environment. A comparison of waters in contact with the processed Cambrian-Ordovician black shale in Degerhamn and acid sulfate soils of the region shows that these two sulfide-bearing materials, in many respects very different, delivers basically the same suite of trace elements to the aquatic environment. This has implications for environmental planning and protection in areas where these types of materials exist. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dispersal is crucial for gene flow and often determines the long-term stability of meta-populations, particularly in rare species with specialized life cycles. Such species are often foci of conservation efforts because they suffer disproportionally from degradation and fragmentation of their habitat. However, detailed knowledge of effective gene flow through dispersal is often missing, so that conservation strategies have to be based on markrecapture observations that are suspected to be poor predictors of long-distance dispersal. These constraints have been especially severe in the study of butterfly populations, where microsatellite markers have been difficult to develop. We used eight microsatellite markers to analyse genetic population structure of the Large Blue butterfly Maculinea arion in Sweden. During recent decades, this species has become an icon of insect conservation after massive decline throughout Europe and extinction in Britain followed by reintroduction of a seed population from the Swedish island of Oland. We find that populations are highly structured genetically, but that gene flow occurs over distances 15 times longer than the maximum distance recorded from markrecapture studies, which can only be explained by maximum dispersal distances at least twice as large as previously accepted. However, we also find evidence that gaps between sites with suitable habitat exceeding similar to 20 km induce genetic erosion that can be detected from bottleneck analyses. Although further work is needed, our results suggest that M. arion can maintain fully functional metapopulations when they consist of optimal habitat patches that are no further apart than similar to 10 km.

AB  - We describe an extensive metapopulation study on the Glanville fritillary Melitaea cinxia, in a network of 1502 discrete habitat patches, comprising the entire distribution of this butterfly species in Finland. A thorough survey of the easily detected larval groups revealed a local population in 536 patches (dry meadows). We demonstrate that this system satisfies the four necessary conditions for a species to persist in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonizations. Patterns of patch occupancy support several qualitative and quantitative model predictions. With decreasing regional density and average area of habitat patches, the butterfly occurs in a diminishing fraction of suitable habitat. To our knowledge. this is the first conclusive demonstration, based on a comparison of many conspecific metapopulations, of declining habitat occupancy and hence of increasing threat to survival caused by increasing habitat fragmentation.

AB  - A radical decarbonization pathway for the Norwegian society towards 2050 is presented. The paper focuses on the role of hydrogen in the transition, when present Norwegian petroleum export is gradually phased out. The study is in line with EU initiatives to secure cooperation opportunities with neighbouring countries to establish an international hydrogen market. Three analytical perspectives are combined. The first uses energy models to investigate the role of hydrogen in an energy and power market perspective, without considering hydrogen export. The second, uses an economic equilibrium model to examine the potential role of hydrogen export in value creation. The third analysis is a socio-technical case study on the drivers and barriers for hydrogen production in Norway. Main conclusions are that access to renewable power and hydrogen are prerequisites for decarbonization of transport and industrial sectors in Norway, and that hydrogen is a key to maintain a high level of economic activity. Structural changes in the economy, impacts of new technologies, and key enablers and barriers in this transition are discussed. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Veteran hollow trees are keystone structures in ecosystems and provide important habitat for a diverse set of organisms, many of which are involved in the process of decomposition. Since veteran trees are 'islands' of high biodiversity, they provide a unique system in which to study the relationship between biodiversity and decomposition of wood. We tested this relationship with a balanced experiential design, where we quantified the taxonomic and functional diversity of beetles directly involved in the process of decomposing wood, and measured the decomposition of experimentally added bundles of small diameter wood around 20 veteran trees and 20 nearby young trees in southern Norway. We found that the diversity (both taxonomic and functional) of wood-decomposing beetles was significantly higher around the veteran trees, and beetle communities around veteran trees consisted of species with a greater preference for larger diameter wood. We extracted few beetles from the experimentally added wood bundles, regardless of the tree type that they were placed near, but decomposition rates were significantly lower around veteran trees. We speculate that slower decomposition rates around veteran trees could have been a result of a greater diversity of competing fungi, which has been found to decrease decay rates. Veteran trees provide an ecological legacy within anthropogenic landscapes, enhance biodiversity and influence wood decomposition. Actions to protect veteran trees are urgently needed in order to save these valuable organisms and their associated biodiversity.

AB  - Large carnivores adjust their daily movement patterns in response to environmental factors and/or human disturbance, and often respond differently across their distribution range. Whether such behavioral plasticity is due to environmental or anthropogenic factors has not yet been fully clarified. Beyond large carnivore conservation and management, understanding behavioral changes in the movement patterns of these elusive species may prove useful to evaluate anthropogenic influences on ecosystems. We used 696 318 GPS locations from 105 radio-collared brown bears in 3 study areas in Sweden to construct daily bear movement patterns, calculating the distance traveled by the bears every 30 min. We used a Bayesian approach to analyze whether human and/or road density around bear locations could explain observed differences in bear movement patterns among the areas. Proximity to settlements, a proxy of the generally low human density in Scandinavian bear range, did not influence circadian bear movements. However, bears moved most in the nocturnal and twilight hours and less during daytime in areas with higher road density, compared to roadless areas. Human-caused behavioral changes in large carnivores may have potential ecosystem-level consequences, given the key ecological role that these species can play in ecosystems. Limiting the creation and use of roads is necessary to maintain large carnivore distribution ranges and movement corridors, reduce human-caused mortality, and minimize human-induced disturbance that modifies carnivore behavior.

AB  - An Internet-based system for informing on multimodal travel planning (several modes of transportation) was introduced in Stockholm, Sweden in October 2000 in the form of a web page called trafiken.nu. The web page has a historical value of being one of the first attempts in Europe, and possibly the world, at providing an ICT-based travel planning service geared towards facilitating sustainable travel to the general public. The aim of this article is to investigate the historical development of trafiken.nu in order to draw lessons on how to better provide for a public information service with a potential for facilitating sustainable travel planning. Findings from the study of trafiken.nu suggest that the organizations behind the service have been slow in adapting to shifting media technology practices on how to provide for information which has affected the uptake of the service. Lessons from the case study provide a basis for arguing that organizations attempting to implement public information services would benefit from finding a means of harnessing collective intelligence in order to provide for a more customizable and responsive service to the general public.

AB  - We investigated possible avoidance behavior of calving semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) near recreational cabins, roads, and power transmission lines in Repparfjord Valley, northern Norway. The distribution, sex, and general age composition of the reindeer were mapped during the 1998 and 1999 calving seasons (n=776 and n=678, respectively) using systematic snowmobile and ski surveys. Mean reindeer density within preferred habitat was 78% lower in the area <4 km from the tourist resort compared to the area >4 km from the resort (1.47 vs. 6.68 reindeer/km(2), respectively). Mean reindeer density by the power line corridor without traffic was 73% lower in the area <4 kin from the power line compared to areas >4 km from the power line for comparable habitat. Areas <4 kin from anthropogenic structures were avoided despite low levels of human traffic and a high proportion of preferred habitat. Within snow-free sites available for grazing, no significant differences occurred in phenological development of cotton-grass (Eriophorum spp.), in live:dead ratio of plant material, or in graminoid biomass with distance to the tourist resort. Almost 74% of all available forage was located within the avoided 0-4-km zones front the resort or the separate power line. Our results suggest that power lines, even without human traffic, may result in substantial reductions in the use of foraging areas. The combined actions of power lines, roads, and cabins may increase potential avoidance, thereby increasing the use of remaining undisturbed grazing grounds. Possible increased competition for high-quality forage may affect lactation, body condition, and, hence. reproductive success in the long term.

AB  - Local commercial fishing is often claimed to attract tourists to coastal communities. We investigate the impact of local fishing on tourism demand, measured as overnight stays, in Sweden. Using municipal-level data for the period 1998-2015, we perform a quantitative analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS) as well as panel-data methods that take unobserved heterogeneity between municipalities into account. A statistically significant positive relationship is found between fishing and overnight stays when OLS is used as the estimation method. The relationship is also found to be stronger on the west and south coasts of Sweden, regions where the fishing cultural heritage is particularly recognized. However, when using panel-data methods that introduce fixed effects for municipalities, we are not able to find a stable significant relationship between fishing and tourism. We therefore find it difficult to claim that fishing promotes tourism, at least when tourism is measured as overnight stays.

AB  - Invasions of nonindigenous species threaten native biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, animal and plant health, and human economies. The best solution is to prevent the introduction of exotic organisms but, once introduced, eradication might be feasible. The potential ecological and social ramifications of eradication projects make them controversial; however, these programs provide unique opportunities for experimental ecological studies. Deciding whether to attempt eradication is not simple and alternative approaches might be preferable in some situations.

AB  - The village of Pegrema in Karelia may be regarded as a Stone Age innovation centre in the large Lake Onega area. Two pollen and plant macrofossil diagrams are presented which represent the first contribution to the study of human impact in the area using anthropogenic pollen indicators. A continuous but sporadic human presence from the Mesolithic onwards is demonstrated. While there is no archaeological evidence relating to the period 4200-3000 B.P., the pollen data suggest continuous, though rather sparse human presence. The data do not support any natural catastrophes in Pegrema as has been suggested elsewhere. Cerealia pollen is recorded earlier than expected (c. 5000 B.P.). In the Bronze Age and Iron Age, the settlement of the Zaonezhye peninsula is reflected by a slight increase in herb pollen representation, sporadic Cerealia pollen and several periods of regression in Picea. The long introductory period of agriculture to the area, as well as the similarities and discrepancies between different sources of evidence (palaeoecological, archaeological and historical) are discussed at some length. The start of land clearance for permanent cultivation in the profile Pegrema S was dated to the late 13(th) century. The beginning of more intensive field cultivation in the 15(th) century is clearly seen in the pollen succession at both localities. The fluctuation in anthropogenic indicators can be related to population density based on historical data. The village of Pegrema was depopulated in 1956 which is reflected in a distinct decline in settlement indicators.

Randomly selected plots (10 x 10 m) were searched for dormouse nests and habitat characteristics of plots with and without nests were compared with logistic regression. Number of shrub species, cover of different shrub species and distance to closest forest edge were the main factors that were related to occurrence of dormice. Dormice have earlier been shown to nest in tree hollows, and thus such nests could be overlooked with our method. However, natural cavities are scarce in the habitats investigated here, and it is argued that the observed preferences for shrubby areas close to forests are real, and different shrub species are suggested to be important as sheltered and predator-safe nest sites and as food sources.

AB  - This study examined two methods for jointly considering the environmental impact and nutritional quality of diets, which is necessary when designing policy instruments promoting sustainable food systems. Both methods included energy content and 18 macro- and micronutrients in the diet, the climate impact, land use and biodiversity damage potential. In Method 1, the content of different nutrients in the diet was normalised based on recommended intake or upper levels for average daily intake and presented together with the environmental impacts, which were normalised according to estimated sustainable levels. In Method 2, the nutritional quality of different diets was considered by calculating their nutrient density score, and the environmental impact was then expressed per nutrient density score. Three diets were assessed; a diet corresponding to Nordic recommendations, the current average Swedish diet and a lifestyle Low Carbohydrate-High Fat (LCHF) diet. Method 1 clearly showed that the climate impact was far beyond the sustainable level for all diets, while land use was within the sustainability limit for the recommended diet, but not the other two. Comparisons based on nutrient density scores depended on the score used, but the current and LCHF diets had more impact than the recommended diet (less livestock products) for all but one score. Over- and under-consumption of nutrients were clearly shown by Method 1 but not possible to distinguish with Method 2, as normalisation was not possible, making it difficult to evaluate the absolute scale of the impacts when nutrient density scores were used. For quantitative information on the environmental and nutritional impacts of diets as support in decision-making processes, it is important that data presentation is transparent. There is limited value in reducing results to a low number of indicators that are easy to read, but difficult to interpret, e.g. nutrient density score. Method 1 allows combined assessment of diets regarding environmental impact and nutritional intake and could be useful in dietary planning and in development of dietary recommendations and other policy instruments to achieve more sustainable food systems.

AB  - The Samis have been present in the Swedish boreal forest for a long time. Their land-use practices were dominant over vast tracts until the late nineteenth century, but little is known Cl about their impact on forest ecosystems. In this study former land use around an old Sami settlement situated in a forest reserve was analysed through historical sources and field investigations. The area around the Sami settlement (about 2.5 ha) comprised young forest (mean age approximately 140 yrs) with little dead wood present. The forest outside this area was much older and contained more dead wood. Scars dating from 1721 to 1962 were found on 118 culturally modified trees, derived from bark-peeling practices and blazes for marking trails and borders. The patterns found constitute a characteristic Sami forest landscape, well distinguished from other types of forest use. The results may be used to identify such areas to preserve crucial structures for posterity.

AB  - QuestionsHow open was the landscape prior to agriculture? Did agriculture start earlier in the south than in the north? How did the vegetation change in different regions after the introduction of agriculture?
   LocationCoast of SW and W Norway.
   MethodsThe REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites) model is applied for pollen-based vegetation reconstruction in 19 time windows over the last 9,000years. Pollen data from 63 sites (lakes and bogs) are compiled and systematically used for data analysis so that the structure of vegetation change in space and time is captured.
   ResultsEstimated cover of selected trees, shrubs, Calluna, graminids and herbs indicate a partly open outer coast throughout the Holocene. The highest tree cover is estimated for 8,200-6,200cal. BP. Broad-leaved trees (Fraxinus, Quercus, Tilia and Ulmus) spread from south to north and were present in the whole region at the end of the Mesolithic (5,950cal. BP). Larger spatial variation in tree cover and a step-wise reduction in deciduous trees after 5,700cal. BP is concordant with increases in open-land taxa indicating human activity. Vegetation changes caused by agriculture are indicated in the very south from ca. 5,950cal. BP. Distinct human-induced vegetation changes with spatial differentiation took place from 4,200 to 1,700cal. BP, when most of the areas earlier covered by deciduous woodland had been transformed to cultivated fields, grasslands and heathlands. Increased Poaceae cover from 1,700cal. BP probably reflects the expansion of mown meadows in addition to pastures.
   ConclusionsCapturing continuous changes of vegetation structure in space and time elucidates open areas along the western coast prior to the introduction of agriculture. Agriculture started earliest in the very south and spread rapidly along the whole coast prior to the Late Neolithic. Differences within the study area have existed in all time periods, reflecting different land-use practices adapted to different natural conditions.

AB  - We tested whether the spatiotemporal distribution of Norway spruce (Picea abies) logs influenced species richness and abundances of wood-decaying fungi in two 2-km(2) boreal forest study sites in southeastern Norway. According to the random sample null-hypothesis equally large subsamples of logs should be equally efficient in sampling fungi from a regional species pool. Based on 0.25-ha plots at I-ha grid resolution, we compared plots with high and low densities of 'new logs' (decay stages 1-5) and plots with,old logs' (decay stages 5-8) present or absent. Based on visible sporocarps, 45 fungus species, including 15 redlisted, were identified among 4151 logs. When rarefying species accumulation curves to the same number of logs, we found no difference in species richness between old forest plots having high and low densities of new logs, or between plots where old logs were present or absent. Curves from young forest revealed fewer species than in old forest. Multiple regression analysis of six redlisted and six common species corroborated the rarefaction analysis in showing that the probability of occurrence was independent of the spatiotemporal distribution of logs for all but two common species. Aside from the fact that more dead wood harboured more wood-decaying fungi, we conclude that the spatiotemporal distribution of dead wood was of minor importance in determining species richness and abundances at the scales of < I ha and < 100 years. This suggests that wood-decaying fungi are not dispersal-limited at these scales, and it offers an optional element in forest management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive plant impacts vary widely across introduced ranges. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the eco-evolutionary experience of native communities with the invader correspond with the impacts of invasive species on native vegetation, with impacts increasing with ecological novelty. We compared plant species richness and composition beneath Pinus contorta to that in adjacent vegetation and other P. contorta stands across a network of sites in its native (Canada and USA) and non-native (Argentina, Chile, Finland, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden) ranges. At sites in North America and Europe, within the natural distribution of the genus Pinus, P. contorta was not associated with decreases in diversity. In the Southern Hemisphere, where there are no native Pinaceae, plant communities beneath P. contorta were less diverse than in other regions and compared to uninvaded native vegetation. Effects on native vegetation were particularly pronounced where P. contorta was a more novel life form and exhibited higher growth rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the eco-evolutionary experience of the native vegetation, and thus the novelty of the invader, determines the magnitude of invader impacts on native communities. Understanding the eco-evolutionary context of invasions will help to better understand and predict where invasion impacts will be greatest and to prioritize invasive species management.

AB  - Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes in northern Europe are increasingly threatened by climate change, which can affect their biodiversity directly by shifting thermal and hydrological regimes, and indirectly by altering landscape processes and catchment vegetation. Most previous studies of northern lake biodiversity responses to environmental changes have focused on only a single organismal group. Investigations at whole-lake scales that integrate different habitats and trophic levels are currently rare, but highly necessary for future lake monitoring and management. We analysed spatial biodiversity patterns of 74 sub-Arctic lakes in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Faroe Islands with monitoring data for at least three biological focal ecosystem components (FECs)-benthic diatoms, macrophytes, phytoplankton, littoral benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, and fish-that covered both pelagic and benthic habitats and multiple trophic levels. We calculated the richness(relative) (i.e. taxon richness of a FEC in the lake divided by the total richness of that FEC in all 74 lakes) and the biodiversity metrics (i.e. taxon richness, inverse Simpson index (diversity), and taxon evenness) of individual FECs using presence-absence and abundance data, respectively. We then investigated whether the FEC richness(relative) and biodiversity metrics were correlated with lake abiotic and geospatial variables. We hypothesised that (1) individual FECs would be more diverse in a warmer and wetter climate (e.g. at lower latitudes and/or elevations), and in hydrobasins with greater forest cover that could enhance the supply of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients that stimulated lake productivity; and (2) patterns in FEC responses would be coupled among trophic levels. Results from redundancy analyses showed that the richness(relative) of phytoplankton, macrophytes, and fish decreased, but those of the intermediate trophic levels (i.e. macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) increased with decreasing latitude and/or elevation. Fish richness(relative) and diversity increased with increasing temporal variation in climate (temperature and/or precipitation), ambient nutrient concentrations (e.g. total nitrogen) in lakes, and woody vegetation (e.g. taiga forest) cover in hydrobasins, whereas taxon richness of macroinvertebrates and zooplankton decreased with increasing temporal variation in climate. The similar patterns detected for richness(relative) of fish, macrophytes, and phytoplankton could be caused by similar responses to the environmental descriptors, and/or the beneficial effects of macrophytes as habitat structure. By creating habitat, macrophytes may increase fish diversity and production, which in turn may promote higher densities and probably more diverse assemblages of phytoplankton through trophic cascades. Lakes with greater fish richness(relative) tended to have greater average richness(relative) among FECs, suggesting that fish are a potential indicator for overall lake biodiversity. Overall, the biodiversity patterns observed along the environmental gradients were trophic-level specific, indicating that an integrated food-web perspective may lead to a more holistic understanding of ecosystem biodiversity in future monitoring and management of high-latitude lakes. In future, monitoring should also focus on collecting more abundance data for fish and lower trophic levels in both benthic and pelagic habitats.
   This may require more concentrated sampling effort on fewer lakes at smaller spatial scales, while continuing to sample lakes distributed along environmental gradients.

AB  - This paper examines how complexity at the land use and transport (LUT) interface can be handled in practice, empirically focusing on a planning activity in Swedish national transport planning, so called Strategic Choice of Measures (SCM). Viewing LUT coordination as a question of handling complexity along two dimensions, one relating to the substantial issues of the problem, the other to the actors involved, the relation between open and focused approaches to delimitation of scope and the participation of actors are analysed in three SCM case studies. The study highlights two necessary but potentially contradicting conditions for LUT coordination. On the one hand, the complexity of problems at the LUT interface requires a comprehensive perspective and a diverse set of participants to enable a sufficiently wide framing of these problems. On the other hand, strategically rational actors will demand an approach which maintains a high degree of relevance for their particular interests, and the process therefore requires a focus on selected issues. The paper concludes that handling complexity at the LUT interface requires an acknowledgement of the need for both approaches, arguing that LUT coordination is benefitted by seeing openness and focusing as complementary rather than contradictory approaches in planning situations.

AB  - Given the extensive progression of industrial forestry in boreal regions that reduces the area of old-growth forests and considerably increases the amount of sharp edges, important declines a-re to be expected among old-forest specialists area-sensitive or edge-avoiding boreal birds. The Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is likely to be one of the species most negatively affected by boreal forestry and is possibly sensitive to forest area and edges. In this study, we quantify the area sensitivity and edge-avoidance of the Three-toed Woodpecker by analyzing its pattern of occurrence at 100 playback stations that had from 8 to 100% forest cover within a 300 m radius. Behavioral observations were also conducted to further investigate its response to edges in logged forests using foraging locations in relation to the nearest clear-cut border. Moreover, we document their foraging movement patterns in two contrasting landscapes (continuous versus shredded forests after logging). Although the occurrence of Three-toed Woodpeckers was highly related to the area of suitable habitat around the playback station, this relationship was quasi-linear and no critical threshold was found within the range of forest cover sampled, The amount of edge did not provide additional information on woodpecker occurrence. Individual woodpeckers in shredded forests did not select foraging trees further away from clear-cut edges than available ones. However, based on the results of the movement path analysis, continuous forests might provide better nesting habitat than residual. shredded forests. Indeed, spatial configuration of residual forest seemed to highly constrain foraging movements of this species because of its strong avoidance of open areas. Considering other studies conducted on forest birds, such modified movement patterns could be particularly harmful while both adults must feed their nestlings and behave as central place foragers. Therefore, even if no pattern of area-sensitivity or edge-avoidance were found, harmful consequences of forest shredding following forest logging may still occur for boreal species such as the Three-toed Woodpecker. However, residual forests strips are essential to maintain this species within managed areas. its population density within such residual forests being comparable to the one obtained in continuous forests.

AB  - Due to rapid urbanization the conservation and values of urban wildlife are becoming increasingly important study objects. Unfortunately, the lack of historical data makes it difficult to assess the effects of long-term urban land-use changes and human attitudes on local biodiversity. In this paper we show that old newspapers may in some cases provide useful historical data on both urban wildlife and local attitudes towards it. In the city of Turku, southwest Finland, the leading newspaper published 316 observations or reports on local urban mammals, birds and reptiles in 1890-1920, and in addition to these a lot of information on contemporary attitudes towards urban wildlife. At least 12 species of noncaptive mammals, 32 species of birds, and three reptile species were documented in newspapers. The newspaper data seem fairly reliable, and provide valuable information on the development of urban biodiversity. In the study period animals visiting urban areas were often persecuted, in which both adults and children (mainly schoolboys) participated actively. Birds were persecuted less frequently than mammals or reptiles. Some bird species, especially 'song-birds', were actively supported by winter-feeding and by constructing nest-boxes. According to newspapers local people were interested in local biodiversity, especially on phenological events, and benefited from it by getting esthetic pleasure, pet animals, and information on seasonal changes.

AB  - We have studied the variation in average performance of Vaccinium myrtillus L. among local populations within an intensively managed boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. Our aim was to identify whether forest disturbance history was an important factor controlling the variation in average plant performance. We used three measures of forest maturity (maturity class, tree biomass and number of trees) as variables reflecting disturbance history. These variables were used in our analysis together with measured environmental conditions (soil moisture, pH, nitrogen, and elevation) a priori known to affect plant performance. To quantify plant performance, we used multiple measures of the local V. myrtillus populations, including percentage cover, average ramet age, height, diameter, biomass, growth, and sexual reproduction (number of fruits and number of mature seeds per fruit). Most of the explained variation in our performance variables could be related to our environmental variables, but disturbance history was also an important determinant of the performance of V. myrtillus. All performance variables were higher in younger, less mature stands, except ramet age, which was highest in mature stands. The increase in performance after clear cutting indicates that this period is of high importance for the population dynamics and persistence of V. myrtillus in intensively managed boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - To increase the production of wood chips for energy from small-diameter (d(1.3)<10 cm) stems in thinnings from young forest stands, Finland's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry provides financial incentives for the production of wood chips through the Sustainable Silviculture Foundation Law (Kemera). As of Autumn 2010, the Kemera incentive system provides subsidies for wood chips derived from small-sized stems of young stands, 16-19(sic)/m(3) (8.0-9.5(sic)/MWh) maximum in typical harvesting conditions (average stem size of removal 30-60 dm(3), and whole-tree chip removal 40-70 m(3)/ha).
   Total production costs of small-diameter thinning of wood chips with and without the Kemera subsidies were researched. The effects of the Kemera incentives on the profitability of whole-tree chip production were presented and discussed. Results gave a clear indication that wood chips from small-diameter stems cannot currently be produced without the Kemera subsidies from young stands with typical harvesting conditions at the current price level of small-diameter wood chips (17-18(sic)/MWh). If operating without the Kemera subsidies at a higher price level of small-diameter wood chips, such as 20(sic)/MWh, the average stem size of whole trees harvested must be greater than 60-70 dm(3) with short road transportation distances between 20 and 40 km to be economically profitable in Finland.

AB  - The aims of this study is to demonstrate how perceptions of the concept of "alcohol abuse" have changed over time and to delineate variations among sub-groups of the Norwegian population. An initial survey was conducted in 1964 in 10 Norwegian cities. Follow-up surveys were conducted in 1989 and 2006 based on national, representative samples. From these samples presumably comparable sub-samples have been selected. The respondents characterised 18 different drinking situations as "abuse", "not abuse" or "doubt". The 18 drinking situations were constructed based on combinations of three degrees of drinking frequencies, three degrees of intoxication and two degrees of sociability. The different combinations were presented to the respondents on cards, and in a random order. Norwegians' perceptions of alcohol consumption have undergone major changes, particularly with respect to perceptions of what constitutes "alcohol abuse". In general, views have become more liberal and permissive. A shift in perceptions since 1964 was already manifest or: evident in 1989, but this has developed further in the same direction since then. The more people drink, the more liberal are their views on what is "alcohol abuse"? This applies both on individual and aggregated levels. Perceptions of drinking practices, especially of "alcohol abuse", have shifted with the change in average alcohol consumption. The higher general consumption the more drinking is allow before it is perceived as abuse. This is probably a reciprocal process with no specific causal direction, but obviously influenced by external factors, such as economic and cultural globalisation, tourism and generally more liberal views on many other facets of society and social life.

AB  - Many cities around the world have taken a pioneering role in tackling climate change and they will be key players in a possible transition to a future low carbon society. However, cities are at the same time constrained and act in a world of multi-level governance where local decision makers are dependent on both higher political levels and other actors in society. In this situation network governance has emerged as a promising 'new mode of governance' where cities can increase both the legitimacy and implementation capacity of an ambitious climate agenda. In network governance the municipality is a facilitator rather than commander and implementer. However, there are also some important potential problems with network governance relating to its democratic legitimacy (politics increasingly carried out by closed elites) and its capacity to lead to radical change (networks of established interests tend to preserve status quo). The aim of this paper is to critically analyse the role of network governance in urban low carbon transitions. The paper builds on original empirical research from the Swedish context which is supplemented by experience found in the literature from other cases. The paper draws from, and merges, two different theoretical perspectives on governance: network governance and transition governance. The literature on network governance asks whether this mode of governance is legitimate and effective, while the literature on transition governance explores what governance configurations are needed in order to steer towards a (low carbon) transition. The findings of the paper show that the effects of network governance are mixed both regarding its policy outputs and its democratic legitimacy. On the implications of network governance for urban low carbon transitions it is argued that while network governance can contribute to niche developments and innovation at the urban level, the elitist character of networks risks maintaining existing unsustainable patterns and defining possible urban futures in too narrow terms.

AB  - The paper discusses social impact management plan (SIMP) as a planning tool for communities to continuously and adaptively manage and address the diverse social changes caused by mining developments. It introduces an empirical case study, where the SIMP is applied to deal with the possibilities and problems that the mining boom has created in a rural, sparsely populated municipality in Northern Europe. The making of the SIMP n the Sodankyla Municipality was the first community-led policy programme focused on mining in Finland. After collaborative planning with relevant stakeholders and political decision-making process, a SIMP laying out shared visions and mutually agreed actions was given the status of an official policy programme in 2018. However, there are several uncertainties related to the realization of the SIMP. From the viewpoint of governance dependencies, there are still differing opinions among the local stakeholders, including the mining companies, about what socially sustainable mining actually means and demands. Also, communities are often left with no other choice than to adapt to the interdependencies inherent in local governance, national legislation and politics. They also have to get used to international economic fluctuations and to the uncertainties intrinsic to the global production and consumption of metals. Nevertheless, the SIMP is a worthwhile effort to achieve the best local solutions related to mining in the northernmost parts of Europe.

AB  - CONTEXT: Agri-food systems face complex sustainability challenges, containing conflicting interests, goals, worldviews and fragmented knowledge and decision-making. There is a need for a better understanding of how to turn knowledge about sustainability into actions for change. The complexity of these challenges necessitates systemic, cross-sectorial, and multi-actor processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to strengthen agri-food systems associated with organic vegetables in the Vestfold region in Norway by involving actors through a living lab and to generate knowledge regarding the establishment phase of cross-cutting change initiatives. This included exploring how actors from within and beyond the agri-food domain could be selected and recruited and investigating what characterize their perceived understanding of the current situation regarding organic vegetables and their shared vision. METHODS: We first drew the boundary of the living lab "system" in relation to improving the situation of organic vegetable agri-food systems. We explored potential participants by developing and applying a procedure for discovering sectors and actors that could contribute to overcome development obstacles. We then used the snowball sampling method and interviewed 48 actors, identifying 80 potential participants. Among these, 30 actors participated in a workshop in which we facilitated co-creative processes for creating a common problem understanding and a shared vision. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The procedure helped identify change-oriented actors within the agri-food domain. Actors represented small-scale entities who had power to influence their own business, as well as in-dividuals within large-scale entities with limited power to influence change in own organizations. We also discovered actors beyond the agri-food domain who did not originally identify themselves closely with the topic of organic food, such as actors from waste management, education, regional, business, and tourism development, and health and welfare. The diversity of actors contributed to a rich and holistic perspective on the current situation for agriculture and food. They co-created a manifold, but coherent, shared vision, portraying a more collaborative orientation in localized agri-food systems. The gaps between current and future desired situations clearly served as a starting point for action planning and testing. SIGNIFICANCE: The study shows crucial steps in establishing an agri-food living lab, including introductory work of bounding the system, selecting actors, and conducting co-creative processes. The study developed and applied a procedure for discovering actors within and beyond the agri-food domain who could contribute to overcoming development obstacles. This procedure can be adjusted and utilized in other settings.

AB  - Intensified forestry increases the interest in replacing native tree species with fast growing nonnative species. However, consequences for native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are poorly understood. We compared cover and composition of major functional groups of ground vegetation between planted stands of non-native Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm. and native conifers Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. in northern boreal Sweden. We quantified the ground cover of lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants and ground without vegetation (bare ground) in 96 stands covering three different age classes (15, 30 and 85 years old). Our study revealed differences in ground vegetation patterns between non-native and native managed forests, and that these differences are linked to stand age and differences in canopy cover. Total vascular plant cover increased with increasing stand age for all tree species, with P. contorta stands having higher cover than both native conifers. The ground cover of lichens was, although generally low, highest in stands of Pinus sylvestris. P. abies stands had a lower cover of vascular plants, but bare ground was more common compared with P. contorta. Our results suggest that the use of P. contorta as an alternative tree species in Fennoscandian forestry will influence native ground vegetation patterns. This influence is likely to change with time and future research should consider both temporal and landscape-scale effects from shifting tree-species dominance to Pinus contorta and other non-native tree species.

AB  - Several historians have placed the roots of the Swedish model and the Swedish spirit of consensus back in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The present study is an attempt to problematize the image of Sweden as the homeland of consensus on earth. I argue that there is no specifically Swedish spirit of consensus. My thesis is that the Swedish model as manifested in the Saltsjobaden Agreement of 1938 was the result of the political power relations that prevailed just then between the parties on the labour market. The thesis is pursued based on a study of developments in Sweden from the 1880s until 1938, that is, from the emergence of the socialist labour movement to the signing of the Saltsjobaden Agreement. I show that conflict was the normal state on the labour market for several decades, and until the mid-1930s, Sweden was the country in the industrialized world with the most strikes. As regards democracy, Sweden was not a pioneer. Every step on the road to democracy was achieved through struggle. When Swedish history is presented as a history of consensus, it is an undervaluation of the efforts that many thousands of people expended in the struggle for civil rights.

AB  - The potential for and environmental consequences of localising primary production of food were investigated by considering different food consumption patterns, based on conventional and organic production. Environmental impact was assessed according to agricultural land use and numbers of production animals, both of which depend on food consumption. The results were quantified in terms of nutrient balances, greenhouse gas and acid emissions and the diversity of crop cultivation, which indicate eutrophication of watersheds, climate change and landscape changes, respectively.
   The study region was able to satisfy its own needs for all farming and food consumption scenarios. Dietary choice had a marked impact on agricultural land use and on the environmental parameters considered. Organic farming for local food production resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with mixed diets, the vegetarian diet was associated with lower emissions and nutrient surpluses, but also with reduced crop diversity. The arable areas allocated to leys and pastures were also smaller.
   The study area represents a predominantly rural region and is a net exporter of agricultural produce. Therefore, only part of the environmental impact of food production results from local needs. Both the differences among the dietary options and the overall environmental benefit of localised primary food production were greatly reduced when considering total agricultural production of the region. Much of the negative impact of agriculture is due to food consumption in the densely populated urban areas, but the consequences are mainly felt in the production areas. The environmental impacts of localisation of primary food production for the rural areas are small and inconsistent. The results indicate the importance of defining 'local' on a regional basis and including the urban food sinks in impact assessment.

AB  - Open Data is valuable source for improving transparency in governance and solving civic problems. When data reserves are opened up as widely as possible, the data becomes raw material for diverse opportunities. The data sets provided through open data portal can be stored, refined and reused by companies and developers to innovate and create new products and services. The data sets should be accessible to a wide range of users, could be accessed for free, could be automatically processed and should have minimal limitations on its transfer and distribution. Innovation, collaboration and growth of new businesses is facilitated as the outcome of such opportunities. The opening up of public services data facilitates innovation of new products and services which create new businesses. Strategy projects related to smart urban development in the cities of Finland provide the models for a collaborative platform required in the near future. A sustainable open data ecosystem would be need to capitalize on the benefits of open data, thereby helping in a transparent, participatory governance.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda recognise the role of cities in achieving sustainable development. However, these agendas were agreed and signed by national governments and thus implementing them at the local level requires a process of adaptation or localisation. In this paper, we analyse five aspects that practitioners and researchers need to consider when localising them: (1) delimitation of the urban boundary; (2) integrated governance; (3) actors; (4) synergies and trade-offs and (5) indicators. These considerations are interrelated, and while not exhaustive, provide an important initial step for reflection on the challenges and opportunities of working with these global agendas at the local level. The paper draws on the inception phase of an international comparative transdisciplinary research project in seven cities on four continents: Buenos Aires (Argentina), Cape Town (South Africa), Gothenburg (Sweden), Kisumu (Kenya), Malmo (Sweden), Sheffield (UK) and Shimla (India).

AB  - Mixed-severity disturbance regimes are prevalent in temperate forests worldwide, but key uncertainties remain regarding the variability of disturbance-mediated structural development pathways. This study investigates the influence of disturbance history on current structure in primary, unmanaged Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests throughout the Carpathian Mountains of central and eastern Europe, where windstorms and native bark beetle outbreaks are the dominant natural disturbances. We inventoried forest structure on 453 plots (0.1 ha) spanning a large geographical gradient ( > 1,000 km), coring 15-25 canopy trees per plot for disturbance history reconstruction (tree core total n = 11,309). Our specific objectives were to: (1) classify sub-hectare-scale disturbance history based on disturbance timing and severity; (2) classify current forest structure based on tree size distributions (live, dead, standing, downed); (3) characterize structural development pathways as revealed by the association between disturbance history and current forest structural, complexity. We used hierarchical cluster analysis for the first two objectives and indicator analysis for the third. The disturbance-based cluster analysis yielded six groups associated with three levels of disturbance severity (low, moderate, and high canopy loss) and two levels of timing (old, recent) over the past 200 years. The structure-based cluster analysis yielded three groups along a gradient of increasing structural complexity. A large majority of plots exhibited relatively high (53%) or very high (26%) structural complexity, indicated by abundant large live trees, standing and downed dead trees, and spruce regeneration. Consistent with conventional models of structural development, some disturbance history groups were associated with specific structural complexity groups, particularly lowseverity/recent (very high complexity) and high-severity/recent (moderate complexity) disturbances. In other cases, however, the distribution of plots among disturbance history and structural complexity groups indicated either divergent or convergent pathways. For example, multiple disturbance history groups were significantly associated with the high complexity group, demonstrating structural convergence. These results illustrate that complex forest structure including features nominally associated with old-growth can be associated as much with disturbance severity as it is with conventional notions of forest age. Because wind and bark beetles are natural disturbance processes that can induce relatively high levels of tree mortality while simultaneously contributing to structural complexity and heterogeneity, we suggest that forest management plans allow for the stochastic occurrence of disturbance and variable post-disturbance development trajectories. Such applications are especially appropriate in conservation areas where biodiversity and forest resilience are management objectives, particularly given projections of increasing disturbance activity under global change.

AB  - Conflicts over managing large carnivores have been prominent in Sweden in recent decades. The most significant controversies are related to wolves, but the bear, lynx, and wolverine are also included. While the state and environmental organizations make efforts to guarantee a viable population of the large protected carnivores, farmers generally have a negative attitude towards large carnivores and a low level of trust in wildlife governance. Based on 22 in-depth interviews, 37 telephone questionnaires with Swedish farmers, and an analysis of 111 applications for protective hunting, this paper aims to demonstrate how these farmers' perspectives on large carnivores can be explained by moral (sense of right and wrong) and moral economy (a system of obligations related to values and relations intervening with political views and financial decisions). The paper argues that farming, in addition to being an economic activity, is integrated with values, heritage, and relations to other human beings and animals. Farmers understand these values to be threatened by large carnivores, especially by wolves. The paper contextualizes negative sentiments, conflicts, protests, and also illegal hunting of large carnivores in relation to a sense of morals, sense of fairness, meanings, traditions, and mechanisms of daily life. We argue that this perspective provides a lens through which to interpret the conflict between farmers on the one side and the state and animal rights activists on the other. Such interpretation has consequences for understanding the legitimacy of government, shifting the focus from the processes of political governance (predominant in liberal political philosophy) to legitimacy tied to collective notions of social goods.

AB  - While urban areas hold great potential for contributing to sustainable development, there is a critical need to better understand and verify what measures improve urban sustainability. To achieve this, this project implements emergy synthesis to evaluate the environmental support to a building-called Smaragden-located in a certified "green" urban district in Uppsala, Sweden. Inputs to the building's construction and maintenance phases are accounted for, as are flows supporting the residents' everyday practices (i.e., urban life), on a yearly per capita basis. In this way, the relative importance of lifestyle issues versus the built environment is quantified and compared. Key focus areas are identified where efficiency and sustainability gains are most likely. The emergy synthesis detailed the top contributors to urban resource consumption and revealed that both the lifestyle and built environment in Smaragden are highly unsustainable, ranking poorly in terms of the emergy indices calculated, and, when considered from a global emergy perspective, overshooting resource consumption by more than 70 times. The paper therefore concludes that interdependencies of urban districts on systems at larger scales of society and environment need to be explicitly addressed and actively incorporated in urban policy and planning, and that design interventions are hence grounded in a systems perspective on urban sustainability.

AB  - The coral species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis are abundant and widely distributed gorgonians in North Atlantic waters. Both species add significant habitat complexity to the benthic environment, and support a host of invertebrate species. Mapping their distribution is an essential step in conservation and resource management, but challenging as a result of their remoteness. In this study, three predictive models Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production and Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt) were applied to predict the distribution of species' suitable habitat across a region of Rost Reef (Norwegian margin) based on multiscale terrain variables.
   All three models were successful in predicting the habitat suitability for both gorgonian species across the study area, and the MaxEnt predictions were shown to outperform other predictions. All three models predicted the most suitable habitats for both species to mainly occur along the ridges and on the upper section of the large slide, suggesting both species preferentially colonize topographic highs. Jackknife tests for MaxEnt predictions highlighted the seabed aspect in relation to P. arborea distribution, and the seabed relative position (curvature) in relation to the distribution of both species. Given the vulnerability of deep-water corals to anthropogenic impacts, further comparative study over a wider study area would be particularly beneficial for the management of the species.

AB  - This study examined whether the patch distribution of four plant species Agrimonia eupatoria, Carlina vulgaris, Hypochoeris maculata and Plantago media were affected by dispersal limitation. Analysis of the patch size/isolation relationship was combined with a seed sowing experiment examining the recruitment of the species. Patch size was negatively correlated to isolation in Carlina, Hypochoeris and indicating that dispersal processes might affect the distribution pattern. Patch size of Agrimonia was not correlated, or in one case positively correlated, to isolation. Agrimonia was also the only species among the four where the recruitment not was affected by disturbance treatment or locality. The recruitment of Carlina, Hypochoeris and Plantago was higher in disturbed plots compared to undisturbed, and the latter two species were also affected by locality. This suggests that Agrimonia is less sensitive to isolation (and the ongoing fragmentation of the landscape) compared to the other three species, probably due to better dispersal and recruitment ability. We conclude in a discussion how different management strategies could serve to maintain viable populations of these species.

AB  - The biodiversity of culturable acidophilic microbes in three acidic (pH 2.7-3.7), metal-rich waters at an abandoned subarctic copper mine in central Norway was assessed. Acidophilic bacteria were isolated by plating on selective solid media, and dominant isolates were identified from their physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The dominant iron-oxidizing acidophile in all three waters was an Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans-like eubacterium, which shared 98% 16S rDNA identity with the type strain. A strain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was obtained from one of the waters after enrichment in pyrite medium, but this iron oxidizer was below detectable levels in the acidic waters themselves. In two sites, there were up to six distinct heterotrophic acidophiles, present at 10(3) ml(-1). These included Acidiphilium-like isolates (one closely related to Acidiphilium rubrum, a second to Acidiphilium cryptum and a third apparently novel isolate), an Acidocella-like isolate (96% 16S rDNA identity to Acidocella facilis) and a bacterium that shared 94.5% 16S rDNA identity to Acidisphaera rubrifaciens. The other numerically significant heterotrophic isolate was not apparently related to any known acidophile, with the closest match (96% 16S rDNA sequence identity) to an acetogen, Frateuria aurantia. The results indicated that the biodiversity of acidophilic bacteria, especially heterotrophs, in acidic mine waters may be much greater than previously recognized.

AB  - Arctic mining has a bad reputation because the extractive industry is often responsible for a suite of environmental problems. Yet, few studies explore the gap between untouched tundra and messy megaproject from a historical perspective. Our paper focuses on Advent City as a case study of the emergence of coal mining in Svalbard (Norway) coupled with the onset of mining-related environmental change. After short but intensive human activity (1904-1908), the ecosystem had a century to respond, and we observe a lasting impact on the flora in particular. With interdisciplinary contributions from historical archaeology, archaeozoology, archaeobotany and botany, supplemented by stable isotope analysis, we examine 1) which human activities initially asserted pressure on the Arctic environment, 2) whether the miners at Advent City were "eco-conscious," for example whether they showed concern for the environment and 3) how the local ecosystem reacted after mine closure and site abandonment. Among the remains of typical mining infrastructure, we prioritised localities that revealed the subtleties of long-term anthropogenic impact. Significant pressure resulted from landscape modifications, the import of non-native animals and plants, hunting and fowling, and the indiscriminate disposal of waste material. Where it was possible to identify individual inhabitants, these shared an economic attitude of waste not, want not, but they did not hold the environment in high regard. Ground clearances, animal dung and waste dumps continue to have an effect after a hundred years. The anthropogenic interference with the fell field led to habitat creation, especially for vascular plants. The vegetation cover and biodiversity were high, but we recorded no exotic or threatened plant species. Impacted localities generally showed a reduction of the natural patchiness of plant communities, and highly eutrophic conditions were unsuitable for liverworts and lichens. Supplementary isotopic analysis of animal bones added data to the marine reservoir offset in Svalbard underlining the far-reaching potential of our multi-proxy approach. We conclude that although damaging human-environment interactions formerly took place at Advent City, these were limited and primarily left the visual impact of the ruins. The fell field is such a dynamic area that the subtle anthropogenic effects on the local tundra may soon be lost. The fauna and flora may not recover to what they were before the miners arrived, but they will continue to respond to new post-industrial circumstances.

AB  - We tested the role of matrix type as a determinant of changes in bird densities associated with patch area (patch size effect) by studying bird distribution in two different landscape contexts: forested islands in archipelagos (low quality matrix) and mature forest patches in landscape managed by forestry (high quality matrix). We predicted that patch area effects (PAE) will be stronger in patches surrounded by a low quality matrix in which movements of individuals are more restricted and alternative resources not available. We assessed the role of species sensitivity to human induced landscape change (estimated from species population trends in long term monitoring data) as a predictor of patch size effect in forest. birds in different landscape scenarios. Overall patch area effects were significantly higher than 0 in real islands but not in patches surrounded by a higher quality matrix. Species more sensitive to large-scale landscape change showed strong patch size effects on islands but not in fragments. Our results suggest that forest fragments do not function as real islands mainly because of the compensatory effects of the surrounding matrix. However, the significant association between large-scale population trends and species responses at a local level in patches surrounded by a low quality matrix suggests that strong changes in landscape matrix quality might be behind recent population decreases of some boreal forest birds.

AB  - Framed by the debate on the privatization of transnational forest governance and the integration of environmental aspects into economic geography, this study employs a relational conceptualization of governance spaces to evaluate aspects of environmental business customer demands on transnational wood processing corporations. The role of forest certification systems on forest governance is critically discussed, as are inter-firm relations and networks of knowledge production concerning sustainable forest management. A case study of four transnational Finnish corporations is employed to display how environmental aspects of resource exploitation are negotiated by various actors and networks along value chains from producers to European core markets. The role of environmentally focused knowledge networks in environmental governance is stressed. The case study is based on qualitative data (in the form of interviews) gathered from representatives of the respective corporations and other forest governance actors. While forest certification systems are acknowledged as an important driver, this study argues that other real and perceived external relations between actors, institutions and resource areas play a more important role in transnational forest governance than most of the current literature on market-driven forest governance' suggests.

AB  - Biogas from waste and residues is a renewable transportation fuel, which can contribute directly to the fulfillment of several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In this paper, we address the question of how biogas value chains, and the respective actor networks, emerge at the local level. The purpose of the paper is to empirically assess the development of local biogas transport systems in three Swedish regions, and how policy including so-called network management - can support this development. The analysis draws on an analytical framework describing how emerging actor networks can be strengthened, and multiple data collection methods (personal interviews, workshop, and secondary sources). The results indicate that four factors explain the success of developing effective local biogas systems: (i) a clear political vision and an adequate basis for decision-making; (ii) a reliance on green public procurement giving priority to biogas vehicles (including follow-up); (iii) integrated actor networks, facilitating knowledge development and sharing of information; and (iv) strategies to deal with an uneven system growth.

AB  - This paper examines a set of criteria for processes that aim to attain sustainable river basin planning at the regional scale. The criteria answer to the lack of deductive methodologies for the assessment and development of participatory approaches to water planning. They are derived from the two concepts and sustainability principles participation and integration. The criteria are here explained and their use is illustrated by presentation of the results and conclusions from two case studies. The first case concerns an assessment of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). - In what ways does the WFD support or obstruct processes for sustainable water management? The second case concerns the ongoing planning processes in Sweden that follow from the implementation of the WFD. The cases show that the criteria work well in achieving their purpose as their use resulted in practicable proposals for taking the studied planning objects closer to meeting the criteria.

AB  - Sustainable transport analyses are traditionally carried out from two fundamentally different perspectives:
   a) Internal travel analysis at an organisational level, often as part of corporate environmental audits to develop internal travel policies and company travel plans.
   b) Macro analysis of the transport system at large, in order to assess traffic flows in relation to alternative infrastructure measures and policy actions at regional level.
   From a holistic global perspective, both these subsystems should share common visions and long-term targets for sustainability. This would require derivation of processes and tools by which subsystems at different scales could be interlinked and informed by global principles for sustainability. A key component of such work would be to synthesise approaches (a) and (b) in order to facilitate mutual understanding between private and public actors, and between public transport authorities governing the supply of transport services. At present there is rarely mutual understanding between these parties, which risks creating watertight bulkheads between users and providers in the transport system.
   This case study examined a local travel planning network in the largest business district of Sweden, Kista Science City (KSC), where (as in most larger urban business districts in the world) travel demand is likely to exceed the capacity of the transport system in the coming decade. To counteract this development, some major companies were invited to join the decision process in a joint venture with public authorities. In the project, a backcasting-orientated travel planning model was applied and refined for future monitoring of the process in a regional context. Key findings were:
   Identification of motives for companies to engage in company travel planning.
   Demonstration of a need for construction of tangible target scenarios pinpointing the utility and benefits of target fulfilment from both a company and an employee perspective.
   The first follow-up results of Climate and Economic Research in Organisations (CERO) processes implemented in companies, which showed that emissions reduction targets were met (and even exceeded).
   Construction of a regional target scenario, consistent with the company-specific target scenarios, in order to obtain constructive and target-orientated stakeholder dialogue.

AB  - Due to traditional forest management, the primary goal of which is the production of raw wood material, commercial forest stands are characterized by low biodiversity. At the same time, commercial forests make up the majority of forests in the Central European region, which means a significant impact on the biodiversity of the entire large region. Saproxylic species of organisms are a frequently used criterion of biodiversity in forests. Based upon the analysis of 155 scientific works, this paper defines the fundamental attributes of the active management supporting biodiversity as well as the preservation of the production function. Using these attributes, a model management proposal was created for three tree species, which takes into account the results of research carried out in the territory of the University Forest Enterprise of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, since 2019. The optimum constant volume of deadwood in commercial stands was set at 40-60 m(3)/ha, 20% of which should be standing deadwood. The time framework is scheduled for an average rotation period of the model tree species, while the location of deadwood and frequency of enrichment must comply with the rate of decomposition, the requirement for the bulkiest dimensions of deadwood possible, and the planned time of tending and regeneration operations in accordance with the models used in the Czech Republic. The goal of active management is to maintain the continuity of suitable habitats for sensitive and endangered species. The estimates of the value of retained wood for decomposition can be as high as 45-70 EUR/ha/year for spruce and beech, and about 30 EUR /ha/year for oak.

AB  - The relationship between the conservation of plant genetic resources and their culture history is intimate. Consequently, biodiversity research must also take into account historical and cultural factors. An inventory of plants collected from all over Sweden was made with the aim of establishing a national Swedish gene bank for once cultivated hop. Only female hop, which could be regarded as cultivated hop on the basis of history, were selected. In this study, two different inventory methods were used: one based on plant habitat and the other involving the use of historical documents, primarily large-scale maps from the first half of the seventeenth century, used to locate their cultivars today. The documented history of the hop, combined with its biology, is the basis for the methods used. Hop is the only Swedish crop that according to a 1442 law had to be cultivated. The law lasted for over 400 years. Since the hop is a perennial, dioecious plant and only female individuals are cultivated, over time very few genetic recombination events are expected. Today, it is possible to connect and identify living plants using historical documents. The degree of connection between today's living plants and the historical evidence for hop cultivation differ between the two methods.

AB  - During the last decade, it has become evident that planet earth will be warming. Hence, there is an increasing focus on how to adapt to a changing climate. The adaptation literature underlines the importance played by local government in planning and implementing adaptation policies. This article is addressing learning-knowledge-action processes within and between local (municipal) and central (national and regional) government levels, thereby filling a gap in the literature. The analysis is using empirical data from Norway; a country commonly considered as having a well-developed multi-level governance system, with a strong bottom-up component, thereby apparently meeting a core condition for developing and implementing transformational changes. The study finds that single and double-loop learning are dominating, fostering incremental changes, but combined incremental changes related to technically handling surface water are approaching transitional change. As a first step, the study suggests it is necessary to formulate policies that explicitly combe incremental changes in order to achieve transitional and transformational change. Moreover, policies for fostering oppositional knowledge networks as part of vertical-horizontal governance may be necessary for pushing the system in the direction of transition and transformation.

AB  - Cross-scale interactions affect resilience in a wide array of social systems such as flood risk management, but it has been argued that studies of such interactions remain limited. Based on qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and policy document analysis, I employed the panarchy framework in an analysis of temporal changes and cross-scale interactions in flood risk management at the local and regional scale in Rovaniemi, in Finnish Lapland. The results revealed that administrative co-operation in flood preparedness has functioned well in Rovaniemi in recent decades and few changes have been made to it. Nevertheless, flood defense measures have been the subject of a persistent and dynamic conflict, which has been locked in a polarized phase. Among local residents? approaches to flood risk management, there have been few changes in preparedness, although administrative actors have emphasized communication and self-preparedness in recent years. I discuss how the cross-scale mismatches have contributed to hinder the flood risk management, sharpen the conflict over flood defense measures, and keep the local residents? level of preparedness low.

AB  - The idea that climate change adaptation is best leveraged at the local scale is a well-institutionalized script in both research and formal governance. This idea is based on the argument that the local scale is where climate change impacts are "felt" and experienced. However, sustainable and just climate futures require transformations in systems, norms, and cultures that underpin and reinforce our unsustainable practices and development pathways, not just "local" action. Governance interventions are needed to catalyse such shifts, connecting multilevel and multiscale boundaries of knowledge, values, levels and organizational remits. We critically reflect on current adaptation governance processes in Victoria, Australia and the Gothenburg region, Sweden to explore whether regional-scale governance can provide just as important leverage for adaptation as local governance, by identifying and addressing intersecting gaps and challenges in adaptation at local levels. We suggest that regional-scale adaptation offers possibilities for transformative change because they can identify, connect, and amplify small-scale (local) wins and utilize this collective body of knowledge to challenge and advocate for unblocking stagnated, institutionalized policies and practices, and support transformative change.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) transport and retention in streams are largely determined by hydrological characteristics (e.g. water runoff, baseflow index (BFI) and flashiness index (FI)) in the catchment. It is important to know the impact of catchment characteristics such as land use, subsurface drainage intensity, elevation difference and catchment size on the hydrological properties and N loss. This paper presents a comparison of the magnitude and variation of the baseflow and flashiness in streams in relation to the selected geographical and drainage characteristics for thirty studied agriculture dominated catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries and the effects it can have on N loss. The analysis included measured data from the total discharge and nitrogen loss at the catchment outlets for the period from the beginning of 1993 to 2011, although there is variation in the length of periods among catchments and countries. The study revealed that the rate of subsurface drainage systems and drainage intensity (given as lateral tile drainage spacing) were statistically significant explanatory variables in explaining differences in hydrological characteristics between catchments. There is a considerable increase in the FI, almost by a factor of three, when using hourly discharge values instead of average daily values, indicating that large diurnal variation in discharge can occur, especially at higher FI values. The analysis also showed that there is a negative relation between FI and the BFI, i.e. a high BFI corresponding to a low FI and vice versa. In general, there seems to be a positive relationship between long-term average runoff and N loss, with the highest runoff and N loss occurring in the Norwegian catchments. However, flow path can have a significant influence on the N loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimentation with novel technologies mobilises resources and constructs expectations for systemic transition, yet there is limited research that examines large numbers of energy experiments. Our approach explores an idea of a patchwork of niches and contributes to transitions literature by looking beyond individual experiments. The analysis in this article identifies four clusters of sustainable energy networks (i.e. patchworks of niches), highlighting the roles of urban prosumption, rural production, small towns as integrators, and electric transport in the technological change in the Finnish energy system. The recognition of interconnections between technologies, settings and uses envisages the future scope of patchworks of regimes, and thereby provides an empirically founded, forward-looking knowledge base for political planning and development of social learning. The network analysis of the experiments was executed using Gephi visualisation and exploration software with a specific focus on energy technologies, energy sources, sites, forms of energy use and locality. A large Finnish database on sustainable energy experiments was used to identify and network connections between the core characteristics of such experiments.

AB  - Questions Small, remnant habitats embedded in degraded, human-dominated landscapes are generally not a priority in conservation, despite their potential role in supporting landscape-scale biodiversity. To warrant their inclusion in conservation management and policy, we question under which conditions they may exhibit the largest conservation value. Location Nine landscapes spread across the counties of Stockholm and Sodermanland, Sweden. Methods Per landscape, plant communities were surveyed in 6 and 12 1 x 1 m(2) plots across large, intact semi-natural grasslands and small remnant grasslands, respectively. These two contrasting grassland types served as a model system. A topsoil sample was taken in each plot to determine habitat quality in terms of soil pH, plant-available P, and C:N ratio. We used a joint species distribution model to analyse the extent to which grassland type and habitat quality define and predict resident community diversity and composition, including whether they support grassland specialists. Results At the landscape scale, the combined remnant grasslands sustained diverse plant communities which did include a significant subset of habitat specialists. Yet, the contribution of individual remnants clearly varied with local-scale habitat quality; soil phosphorus availability lowered plot-level species richness, mostly by constraining the occurrence of grassland specialists. Semi-natural grassland communities were comparatively insensitive to variation in soil phosphorus availability. Conclusions The combined habitat amount and the significant number of habitat specialists sustained by remnant grasslands with high habitat quality, shows they can represent a valuable resource to support landscape-scale biodiversity conservation. This offers no wildcard to neglect the continued biotic and abiotic threats on semi-natural grassland plant diversity such as chronic and accumulating P eutrophication, discontinuation of management or poor matrix permeability, as semi-natural grasslands harbour the majority of habitat specialists, while sourcing surrounding remnant grassland communities.

AB  - Analyzing the structure and functioning of the urban system revealed ways to optimize its structure by adjusting the relationships among compartments, thereby demonstrating how ecological network analysis can be used in urban system research. Based on the account of the extended exergy utilization in the sector of urban socio-economic system, which is considered as the composition of extraction (Ex), conversion (Co), agriculture (Ag), industry (In), transportation (Tr), tertiary (Te) and households (Do) sectors, an urban ecological network model is constructed to gain insights into the economic processes oriented to sustainable urban development. Taking Beijing city as the case, the network accounting and related ecological evaluation of a practical urban economy are carried out in this study in the light of flux, efficiency, utility and structure analysis. The results showed that a large quantity of energy and resources have to be consumed to maintain the structure and function of a city. The thermodynamic efficiencies of individual sector in Beijing remain at a low level. The social system in Beijing is a highly competitive network, and there are 8 competitive relations and only two mutualistic ones. The Domestic and Agricultural sector are the major controlling factors of the system. Moreover, the assessment results of Beijing are compared with the other three socio-economic systems, Norway, UK and Italy, and the ecological network function and structure comparisons are correspondingly illuminated and discussed. The conclusions indicate that the exergy-based network analysis can be refined to become an integrative tool for evaluation, policy-making and regulation for urban socio-economic system management concerning structure and efficiency at urban levels.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find out if field boundaries are refuges for earthworms from where they can spread out into the agricultural fields, thereby keeping up their abundance and biodiversity. The earthworm community was studied in: (1) a 640 in long field boundary; (2) the adjacent arable field at different distances from the boundary; (3) a pasture adjoining to the opposite side of the field near Uppsala in Sweden. Sampling was done in May and September. In contradiction to what was preconceived, the abundance and biomass of earthworms, both in the boundary and the pasture, was significantly lower than that in the agricultural field. The density increased towards the centre of the field. The trends were similar for both spring and autumn. The same species were found in the field, boundary and pasture, but Aporrectodea caliginosa was more dominant in the field than in the other habitats. The conclusion is that agriculture with manure, fertilisers, moderate soil cultivation and varying crops, in general, is favourable for earthworms, except for certain species. However, situations can occur when the earthworm populations in the field decline, and then boundaries may serve as sources from where re-immigration can take place. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Vacant housing has been associated with a variety of interests from economic implications and consequences for the urban structure to the possibility of providing housing for the homeless. In addition to these social and financial aspects, unused buildings have resources embedded in them. They take land from other activities and contain refined natural resources in the form of building components and materials. Therefore, empty buildings can be regarded as reserves for housing and repositories for urban mining, i.e. material extraction. In doing so, these buildings contribute to the resilience of cities. This geographical and statistical study on residential vacancies is situated in Finland, where empty homes may also keep using energy and producing emissions. The research material consists of a vast dataset of all residential buildings with vacancies in Finland in mid-2014, a total of 275486 buildings with 1100267 occupied and 378802 unoccupied dwellings (52% of the Finnish housing stock). The paper shows several characteristics that increase the understanding of vacancies and their role in the dynamics of the building stock. Public policy should address the issue of vacancy, not only because of social and economic implications but also because of its environmental impacts and opportunities.

AB  - The Barents Sea is a rich fishing area with the biggest cod stock in the world. This stock is now in excellent conditions, producing record catches fully within safe and sustainable biological parameters. The spawning stock biomass of the main groundfish species has increased threefold over the last 15 years. The Barents Sea management is among the most successful management regimes of a major fishery area anywhere, and the focus of this paper is on the governance of the fisheries. The joint Russian-Norwegian governance over the last almost 40 years, through the Joint Fisheries Commission, is a major element in this successful result. The scientific cooperation is described and how it is now integrated into the work of the Commission. The development of long-term strategies for management of joint stocks is described, resulting in agreement on a set of "decision rules" and new regulatory decisions. The period of major problems with overfishing of quotas is described. The level and comprehensiveness of the cooperation is explained with a discussion of the present agreement, for 2015. The issues of zonal borders and the Svalbard Fishery Protection Zone are explained. The paper concludes with comments on the outlook for the future, considering the present situation in relation to developments in Crimea and Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to present and test a framework for lean implementation in the agricultural sector, addressing challenges from an operational and strategical perspective. The article builds on the previous literature on the use of Lean and reports empirical data from a lean implementation project in the south-western Sweden, including interviews, observations, diaries and questionnaires. A framework is developed to examine strategic and operational perspectives on Lean Thinking. Using this framework, a number of challenges encountered in Lean implementation are presented. This article is limited to the study of Lean among a group of Swedish farms although its findings may have implications for the wider agricultural sectors. Many societal challenges are linked with agricultural sustainability, stressing the need for productive, resource-efficient, resilient and less wasteful food production. This article is the first to develop and test a Lean implementation framework in the agriculture sector.

AB  - Species-habitat models are important tools in conservation and wildlife management today. Models simulating the long-term ecological consequences of forestry on biodiversity have large potential as guidance for management. In this paper, we evaluated a model, lichen biomass spatially explicit model (LIBSEM) that predicts the temporal and spatial distribution of epiphytic lichens in boreal coniferous forests. We assessed model performance by simulating the standing crop of pendulous lichens (Bryoria spp.) over a 50-year period in a managed forest landscape (Brattaker,4405 ha). We compared the simulated data with independent field data based on sampling of lichen litter in 54 plots stratified by forest age class. Simulated epiphyte standing crop was significantly related to field data but overall model performance was rather poor at the cell level (50 m x 50 m cells) with a modelling efficiency of 12%. Results suggest that the model succeeded better in predicting lichen biomass on the landscape level. We used LIBSEM to assess possible long-term consequences on epiphytes of four management scenarios differing in the length of the rotation cycle. The change in epiphyte biomass was projected over a 200-year period. Results show that an even-aged silvicultural system with a normal rotation (110 years) only can support a low amount of pendulous lichens while short rotation (60 years) is very detrimental to epiphyte communities. Thus, to enhance the abundance of epiphytic lichens it is necessary to use extended rotations, preferably in combination with forest reserves. We conclude that spatially explicit landscape models may act as a guide for managing boreal forests to improve conditions for epiphytes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Globally there are growing multicultural and multilingual societies. As a result of extensive international migration, the number of elderly migrants has increased and will further increase in the future. This makes it necessary for elderly healthcare services to meet elderly migrants' healthcare needs concerning language and cultural barriers. To our knowledge, previous research in the area of culturally specific nursing homes for migrant seniors is still limited. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the experiences of planning, starting and organizing a culturally specific nursing home for Finnish-speaking older persons. Methods An explorative qualitative study using both semi-structured individual interviews and focus group interviews as data collection. Thirteen informants were purposively recruited, two from Finnish-speaking association, seven healthcare professionals and two family members. Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results Three categories, each with sub-categories, emerged from the data: 1) Motivation to develop this particular culture-specific nursing home; 2) Organizational issues and 3) Aspirations for the future. The study found that information from policy makers, the localization and activities of the nursing home, having healthcare staff who speak the minority language, organizing the nursing home as a mixture of older members of both the majority and the minority communities, all affected the planning, starting and organization of a culturally specific nursing home. Conclusion This study found that information, localization, activities and language adapted to elderly migrants affected the planning, starting and organization of a culturally specific nursing home for Finnish-speaking older persons. These findings should support the healthcare organization in planning, managing and organizing sustainable nursing home care for older people belonging to a minority in order to attain the aim of person-centered and equal healthcare.

AB  - Background: Conservation of biological diversity and economical utilization of natural resources form an almost inevitable confrontation between the two. In practice, however, a balance between the two ought to be found, and in managed boreal forests, preservation of woodland key habitats is increasingly used strategy to safeguard biological diversity. According to the Finnish Forests Act, certain Forest Act habitat ( FAH) types must be safeguarded, provided they are clearly distinguishable from their surroundings. Furthermore, once the habitat has been identified as a FAH, its special characteristics must not be altered. Both of these aspects contain ambiguities that potentially undermine the practical application of the Act. We designed a replicated sampling study to address these ambiguities at the most common FAH type, riparian habitat of small boreal streams. As response variables we used vascular plants and mosses. We asked i) how wide is the FAH around small streams that is distinguishable from its surrounding and ii) how wide buffer strip around the FAH is sufficient for long term to preserve the natural species community composition of the FAH.
   Results: We found that an average three meters wide strip around the stream constitutes the distinguishable FAH and that a minimum of 45 meters wide buffers on both sides of the stream are needed for the species community composition to remain unaltered.
   Conclusions: We conclude that 45 meters wide buffers appear sufficient to safeguard vascular plant and moss species communities within the FAH, prevent local populations from extinctions and thus pre-empt extinction debt that would be realised with more narrow buffers. While 45 meters may seem intolerable from the commercial forestry point of view, anything less than that may be intolerable from the point of view of conservation, and thus against the idea of sustainable use of natural resources.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of matrix on the occurrence of hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) in habitat fragments. The study was conducted in two kinds of landscape: (1) an agricultural landscape, where the censused forest habitat fragments were surrounded by farmland, and (2) in an intensively managed forested landscape, where the censused habitat fragments were surrounded by nonhabitat coniferous forest. Occupied and unoccupied habitat fragments in the agricultural landscape differed significantly in distance to the nearest suitable continuous habitat, with hazel grouse occurring only in habitat fragments closer than 100 m from continuous forest. In the intensively managed forest landscape, the effect of isolation was less evident, but there might be a threshold around 2 km. Effects of isolation occurred over much shorter distances when the surrounding habitats consisted of farmland than when it was forested habitats. The size of the habitat fragments was important in both landscapes, with larger habitat fragments more often containing hazel grouse.

Using methods inspired by ethnography, the article illustrates the complex task of drafting strategies in an urban context. The concept of paradox is used to highlight the tensions involved in being strategic in a city, tensions that can also affect the outcome, i.e., the strategy document. Examining organizational paradoxes is a way to deepen our understanding of why the content of a strategy document has certain qualities and why some issues become strategically important while others do not.

AB  - The political landscape in Sweden has undergone considerable changes in recent decades. The number of political parties in the Swedish parliament has increased from five to eight, and the socio-economic issues of the traditional political right-left scale has been challenged by socio-cultural issues relating to lifestyle and identity. Notably, the radical right has had significant electoral success in Sweden based on an ethno-nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. The corporatist model has increasingly been challenged by new forms of political authority, participation and representation. Yet, new political actors such as social movements and civil society actors, think tanks and policy professionals, are becoming increasingly engaged in the political processes. Moreover, traditionally marginalised groups including the young, women and individuals of migrant background are represented to a higher degree in political bodies than before. In this article, we introduce the articles of Sociologisk Forskning's special issue on the Swedish political landscape and give an overview of the main developments of politics and society in the country.

AB  - Background The gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) Ostertagia ostertagi can cause severe disease in first season grazers (FSG) and impaired performance due to subclinical infections in adult cows. Diagnostic methods to assess exposure include faecal egg count and detection of specific antibodies using antibody-ELISAs resulting in an optical density ratio (ODR). Using the ELISA test on bulk tank milk (BTM) allows for a herd level diagnosis. Appropriate use of diagnostic methods for evaluation of O. ostertagi exposure is required to optimize herd parasite surveillance and aid in a sustainable control regime. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between different diagnostic tests used to assess GIN exposure in Norwegian production systems. A cross-sectional field study was carried out in twenty herds in Norway in the fall of 2020. Serum and faecal samples were taken from 380 individuals, of which 181 were FSG and 199 were cows. In addition, milk was collected from every cow and one BTM sample was taken from each herd. Faecal egg counts were performed. The distribution of ODR values in individual samples within and between herds and the associations between BTM ODR and individual ODR values were described. The data were analysed using visual assessment of scatter plots, Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression.Results A high variability of the within-herd individual ODR values in serum and milk in every herd was detected. The ODR in BTM explained a low degree of the variation in the individual serum and milk samples. When plotting the ODR results in milk or serum according to four BTM categories, the distribution of ODR values were notably different in the highest and lowest BTM categories. The correlation between individual milk and serum samples was moderate (r = 0.68), while the highest correlation (r = 0.81) was between the BTM ODR and the group average individual milk samples.Conclusions A poor predictive ability for BTM ODR to assess individual ODR values in both FSG and cows was demonstrated. However, the study indicates that the evaluation by ELISA test on BTM to assess exposure to GIN could be useful in herds with a very high or low BTM ODR.

AB  - A changing operational environment and the growing opposition to mining in the Nordics, and more broadly in Europe, encourages the testing of new approaches to mineral resource governance. A Community Benefit Agreement (CBA) is an instrument based on local negotiations, which has been mostly utilized in indigenous contexts, but may hold promise in other societal contexts. However, a new context means different needs and concerns, requiring adjustments to existing models. In this article, we empirically analyze what factors drive local stakeholders toward collaboration over the impacts and benefits of mining and how a CBA could be realized in Sodankyla, Finland. The data consists of interviews and observations collected from a four-year period of action research. The findings validate the relevance of CBAs or similar arrangements in the Finnish mining context. Our study suggests that CBAs excel at addressing the challenges and opportunities that arise from the unique local social and environmental characteristics, which are difficult to address with non-local instruments. Our case shows that the municipality represents only part of the community's interests, which is impacted by mining in varying ways. The roles of local community groups and the municipality in a CBA are key considerations for implementation.

AB  - Dietary climate impact in a Swedish population (56-95 years old) was estimated based on self-reported food intake from 50 000 men and women within two population-based cohorts and on climate data, covering emissions from farm to fork, for 600 foods representative for the Swedish market. Aims were to assess variation in dietary climate impact between population groups and between food categories. Mean dietary climate impact was 2.0 tons of CO(2)e/person/year, with about a threefold variation between high and low impact individuals. Food loss and waste accounted for 18%. Older individuals and women on average had lower total dietary climate impact per year, while differences between gender were smaller per 1000 kcal. Climate impact was greatly affected by dietary composition and especially by the content of animal-based and discretionary foods, responsible for 71% and 12% of total climate impact, respectively. Results indicate a large potential for reduced climate impact by adopting realistic dietary patterns. Suggested strategies to reach climate goals include reduction of red meat and prioritising lower impact foods within meat, dairy and seafood categories, limited consumption of discretionary foods and decreased over-consumption of total calories, combined with improvements in production including reduction of food loss and waste.

AB  - High densities of ungulates can increase human-wildlife conflicts. Where forestry is an important economy, intensive browsing can lead to browsing damage, resulting in volume losses, poor stand regeneration, and reduced timber quality. The forestry industry thus looks for practical, long-term measures to mitigate browsing damage. We tested the effect of two mitigation measures on moose (Alces alces) browsing behaviour and damage to Scots pine (Pinus sylvetris): (1) ungulate-adapted slash piles (i.e., palatable species only) created during felling to increase short-term food availability and (2) intensified soil scarification to increase long-term food availability (collectively, 'ungulate-adapted forestry'). Our study occurred in southern Norway where we established fixed vegetation and moose faecal pellet plots at varying distances from conventional and ungulate-adapted slash piles and scarified stands. We evaluated the effects of ungulate-adapted slash piles and intensified scarification on the density of undamaged Scots pine, moose bite diameters, browsing pressure, and moose faecal pellet density. To assess the effect of spatial scale, we created 250 m, 500 m, and 1000-m radius buffers centered on each plot. We found that ungulate-adapted logging near our plots increased the density of undamaged pines, as compared to no and conventional logging. We found that logging in general led to smaller bite diameters. We also found that plots near conventional logging had higher browsing pressure, whereas browsing pressure near ungulate-adapted logging was similar to unlogged stands. For scarification, density of undamaged pine increased when the ungulate-adapted stand aged whereas undamaged pine decreased as conventional scarification stands aged. Browsing pressure showed a response at the smallest spatial scale only for ungulate-adapted scarification. Peak moose habitat use near conventional and ungulate-adapted scarified stands differed by stand age and distance from scarification. The overall effects of ungulate-adapted forestry were most pronounced at the smallest spatial scale (250 m). Our results support 'ungulate-adapted' forestry as a practical solution to mitigate browsing damage but uncertainty in some of our estimates suggest further research on the area treated is needed.

AB  - This study explores cross-cultural differences in car travel behaviour in a northern and an eastern European country, namely Sweden and Estonia. We assess the role of country-specific socio-structural circumstances, and the influence of individual motivations, including social values, perceived seriousness of environmental problems associated with car use, and car use reduction intentions, in shaping the frequency of car use for different purposes. The results show that compared to Swedish people, people in Estonia are more dependent on cars in their everyday travel. Our study shows that higher social position is associated with higher frequency of car trips in more stratified Estonian society, but not necessarily where socio-economic differences are less pronounced, as in Sweden. Regarding the relative significance of values and intentions next to socio-economic determinants, values and intentions have a greater explanatory power of car use frequency in Estonia, compared to Sweden. That values and preferences play a smaller role in car travel frequency in the socio-economically more secure Sweden, indicates that car travel is a basic habit, which is not easily discernible through individual values and attitudes in more affluent societies. Differences in car travel frequencies between the respondents from different settlement types in Estonian but no differences between settlement types in Sweden, shows that a country's broader approach to managing the economic and social viability of its regions, may shape car travel needs and opportunities. The results of this study may have implications in terms of ways of curbing emissions from transportation in different parts of Europe.

AB  - Hydro-biogeochemical models are used to foresee the impact of mitigation measures on water quality. Usually, scenario-based studies rely on single model applications. This is done in spite of the widely acknowledged advantage of ensemble approaches to cope with structural model uncertainty issues. As an attempt to demonstrate the reliability of such multi-model efforts in the hydro-biogeochemical context, this methodological contribution proposes an adaptation of the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) philosophy to nitrogen losses predictions. A total of 4 models are used to predict the total nitrogen (TN) losses from the well-monitored Ellen Brook catchment in Western Australia. Simulations include re-predictions of current conditions and a set of straightforward management changes targeting fertilisation scenarios. Results show that, in spite of good calibration metrics, one of the models provides a very different response to management changes. This behaviour leads the simple average of the ensemble members to also predict reductions in TN export that are not in agreement with the other models. However, considering the convergence of model predictions in the more sophisticated REA approach assigns more weight to previously less well-calibrated models that are more in agreement with each other. This method also avoids having to disqualify any of the ensemble members.

AB  - Despite the extensive literature on learning in urban transitions, we still have a limited understanding on how higher-order learning takes place in transition management and is spread within the transition arena. In this paper we analyze the efforts of transferring such embedded knowledge and its interrelation with learning through the examples of three Swedish municipalities engaged in urban transition management. To do so, we developed a framework of learning ripples that conceptualizes learning across social boundaries as an active and two-way process that goes beyond transferring and receiving knowledge, but also requires higher order learning that includes knowledge integration in the form of defining and formulating one's role and contributions to transitions. We found that higher order learning is largely influenced by the quality and frequency of interactions between the transferer and receivers. The further a stakeholder was located from the center of the transition arena in terms of direct interactions, the less chance occurred for higher order learning that resulted in tensions and conflicts in the collaboration. Our results show the problem as a lack of knowledge integration or a lack of conditions which allow stakeholders to articulate their views or develop an idea about their own role in the whole process.

AB  - Background: More knowledge about suicidality and suicide risk profiles in acute psychiatric hospital patients (both first-time and chronic patients) is needed. While numerous factors are associated with suicidality in such populations, these may differ across cultures. Better understanding of factors underlying suicide risk can be informed by cross-cultural studies, and can aid development of therapeutic and preventive measures.
   Methods: An explorative, cross-sectional cohort study was carried out. Acutely admitted patients at one psychiatric hospital in northwest Russia and two in northern Norway were included. At admission, demographic, clinical, and service use data were collected, in addition to an assessment of suicidal ideation and attempts, comprising five dichotomic questions. Data from 358 Norwegian and 465 Russian patients were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. Within each cohort, attempters and ideators were compared with patients not reporting any suicidality.
   Results: The observed prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was significantly higher in the Norwegian cohort than in the Russian cohort (chi(2) = 168.1, p < 0,001). Norwegian suicidal ideators and attempters had more depressed moods, more personality disorders, and greater problems with alcohol/drugs, but fewer psychotic disorders, cognitive problems or overactivity than non-suicidal patients. Russian suicidal ideators and attempters were younger, more often unemployed, had more depressed mood and adjustment disorders, but had fewer psychotic disorders and less alcohol/drug use than the non-suicidal patients.
   Conclusions: Rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal attempts in Norwegian patients were intermediate between those previously reported for patients admitted for the first time and those typical of chronic patients. However, the significantly lower rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal attempts in our Russian cohort as compared with the Norwegian, contrasted with what might be expected in a region with much higher suicide rates than in northern Norway. We suggest that suicide-related stigma in Russia may reduce both patient reporting and clinicians' recognition of suicidality. In both cohorts, overlapping risk profiles of ideators and attempters may indicate that ideators should be carefully evaluated and monitored, particularly those with depressed moods, alcohol/substance abuse disorders, and inadequate treatment continuity.

AB  - Building upon recent work in sustainability transitions studies and economic geography, this paper is concerned with the process of legitimation by which emerging technologies are aligned with broader societal rules and norms. Challenging the assumption of earlier research that legitimation occurs within regional and national borders, the paper views legitimation as set of transregional processes whereby the actors behind emerging technologies seek support from different regional and national organizations on an international basis. Inspired by the Global Production Networks (GPN) approach, the paper argues that technology legitimation can be un-derstood as a trans-regional process of strategic coupling between the strategic needs of the industrial actors advancing new technologies and the efforts of national and regional organizations to promote their territories as leading nodes in emerging production networks. Empirically, the paper adopts a micro-level focus on the legitimation of a particular renewable energy technology: the Hywind floating wind power (FWP) technology, developed by the Norwegian energy firm, Equinor. The paper shows that the FWP technology was gradually legitimated in a pragmatic sense over the three stages of Hywind. The demonstration phase generated a tem-porary and conditional form of legitimacy at an intra-national scale, while the next phase, Hywind Scotland, generated a stronger and more durable form of legitimacy as the world's first floating wind farm. This led to the internalisation of legitimacy from outside into the Norwegian energy regime (absorption) in the third stage of Hywind Tampen.

AB  - Northern agriculture faces a rapidly changing climate with increased weather variability. Yield resilience can be assessed through diversity in responses to critical weather patterns, as demonstrated in several European crops. In this study, we extend the work to demonstrate how the response diversity of barley in Finland has developed over time. A total of 257 barley cultivars tested in 18 locations in Finland during 1980-2020 were clustered according to their yield responses to 12 critical agrometeorological variables. Clustering was based on the scores of the principal component analysis used to group the agrometeorological variables based on the yield responses. To identify the development in the response diversity, the diversity of the clusters cultivated was determined annually. The response diversity increased at the beginning of the 21st century but has declined since 2013. Consequently, the Northern barley cultivar selection has become more vulnerable to weather variation despite an increase of cultivars officially tested. The principal component analysis enabled a more interpretable and meaningful clustering than the formerly performed direct clustering of Finnish barley cultivars according to the agrometeorological variables.

AB  - Market coverage, or merchantability, is more than selling commodities. By offsetting expenditures, it provides an effective tool allowing forest managers to expand funding assistance to improve forest health, habitat, and water quality; reduce fire risk; and sustainably manage forest resources and services. This analysis narrows the focus to mill inputs and evaluates the forest products market extent and competition that exist in Idaho to better prioritize forest health improvement and fire mitigation funding programs. We identify priority landscape areas through market extent and market competition and classify each by quintiles for three harvested wood products (sawlogs, pulpwood, biomass). Generating revenues from selling harvested wood products where barely any markets exist or markets could expand with incentives would allow management projects to be done at a more extensive scope or a lower cost per area. The results can also be used to identify areas to invest in forest product manufacturing facilities. This is valuable information for decision-makers looking to direct public assistance funding toward projects that generate forest products. Study Implications: Allocating funds across competing uses is a fundamental task in forest policy and management. To do it in a way that best reduces threats to forest health and productivity while increasing the social, economic, and environmental benefits those forests provide is challenging. The primary goal of this study was to create a procurement zone or wood basket map that depicts the economically feasible forest regions to primary forest commodities in Idaho. This information can be useful in programs such as the Idaho Department of Lands Forest Action Plan revision, as the degree of merchantability of a given parcel can be helpful in funding prioritization. In addition, our results can be used to identify optimal locations for new investments, understand and estimate the woodshed/wood basket of various products, and visualize constraints of the feedstock supply chain. The methods used here for Idaho are easily transferable to other states and regions.

AB  - Charcoal from archaeological contexts differs from off-site pollen samples as it is mainly a product of intentional human action. As such, analysis of charcoal from excavations is a valuable addition to studies of past vegetation and the interaction between humans and the environment. In this paper, we use a dataset consisting of 6186 dated tree species samples from 1239 archaeological sites as a proxy to explore parts of the Holocene forest development and human-vegetation dynamics in South-Eastern Norway. From the middle of the Late Neolithic (from c. 2000 BC) throughout the Early Iron Age (to c. AD 550) the region's agriculture is characterized by fields, pastures and fallow. Based on our data, we argue that these practices, combined with forest management, clearly altered the natural distribution of trees and favoured some species of broadleaved trees. The past distribution of hazel (Corylus avellana) is an example of human impact on the vegetation. Today, hazel is not even among the 15 most common tree species, while it is one of the most prevalent species in the archaeological record before AD 550. The data indicate that this species was favoured already by the region's Mesolithic hunter-fisher-gatherers, and that it was among the species that thrived extremely well in the early farming landscape. Secondly, our analysis also indicates that spruce (Picea abies) first formed large stands in the south-eastern parts of Norway c. 500 BC, centuries earlier than previously assumed. It is argued that this event, and a further westward expansion of spruce, was partly a consequence of a specific historical event - the first millennium BC farming expansion.

AB  - Agriculture is often described as one of the sectors most vulnerable to future climate change, and its vulnerability is commonly assessed through quantitative indices. However, such indices differ significantly depending on their selected indicators, weighting mechanisms, and summarizing methods, often leading to divergent assessments of vulnerability for the same geographic area. The use of generic indicators might also lead to a loss of information about contextual risks and vulnerabilities. This may reduce the perceived usefulness of indices among stakeholders.
   This study analyses the role of indicators in assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change. It analyses how indices are understood and used through three separate focus group sessions, involving agricultural experts professionally active in south-eastern Sweden. The paper presents how agricultural practitioners perceive a set of common vulnerability indicators, presented through a visualization tool, and their relevance, logic, and applicability to assess and address vulnerability to climate change. The results of this study contribute with perspectives on (i) the relevance and applicability of the commonly used generic indicators for agricultural vulnerability (ii) the assumed correlation of indicators with climate vulnerability and (iii) the identification of missing vulnerability indicators. The study finds that commonly used vulnerability indicators are perceived hard to apply in practice, as definitions and thresholds are often depending on the geographical and temporal scale, as well as the regional context. Additional exposure factors that were identified included extreme events, such as heavy precipitation and external factors such as global food demand and trade-patterns. Further, participants expressed that it is important to include indices that combine effects of multiple climatic changes and in-direct factors, such as policies, regulations and measures. Inherent complexities, context dependencies, and multiple factors should further be included, but entail difficulties in developing suitable indicators. These factors must be addressed by a broader set of qualitative and quantitative indicators, and greater flexibility in the assessment methodology. The interactive vulnerability assessments presented in this paper indicate a need for an integration of quantitative and qualitative aspects and how such indicators could be developed and applied.

AB  - Fertilisation on agricultural farmland was identified as an important source of nutrient losses to the environment in the second half of the 20(th) century. There is only very few data available about the efficacy of the nutrient input in countries of transition where dramatic changes in agricultural production are still in progress. As a result of the reduced fertiliser input the concentration of phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in Lithuanian rivers decreased significantly from 1990 to 2001. The phosphorus concentration declined below the eutrophication level of 0.05 mg L-1. The NH4-N concentration is below the critical threshold of 0.39 mg L-1. In general, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in waters increased with decreasing agricultural production. In Lithuania the NO3-N concentration increased until 1993 and is at the moment on a higher level than before 1990. The NO3-N load is highest in areas of intensive agricultural production, but never exceeded a value of 700 kg N km(-1) yr(-1). Despite the increase of NO3-N concentrations and total N loads, these values are low compared to the nitrogen load in countries with intensive agriculture. The results revealed that losses of nitrogen by leaching at low fertilisation rates depended on management factors rather than fertiliser practices. About 60.000 new farmers without farming knowledge and experience started agricultural production with the transition in 1989. Large quantities of NO3-N might have been lost because of poor manure handling and disturbance of well-established nutrient balances in the soil.
   In 2001 567 t NH4-N, 10,679 t NO3-N and 420 t PO4-P were discharged to the Baltic Sea. The Nh(4)-N load discharged to the Baltic Sea declined by factor 3.1 and the phosphate (P2O5) load by factor 6.7 from 1986 to 2001. During this period the NO3-N load increased 1.5-fold.

AB  - Though the habitats and substrata of bryophytes and lichens overlap, their diversity has not been comparatively explored at large scales. We studied lichens and bryophytes on 30 random 2-km transects in a forest landscape in Estonia. For each vegetation type on each transect, large broad-leaved trees, decorticate snags, logs and windthrows were randomly sampled and their species composition recorded. A total of 108 bryophyte and 127 lichen species were found in 781 sample plots. At the transect scale, larger numbers of lichen species were accompanied with more bryophyte species (r = 0.49; P = 0.006). Substratum diversity explained 38% of the variation in species-richness for lichens and 44% for bryophytes; when this effect was taken into account, the transect-scale co-variance of the species-richness of the two taxa disappeared. Indeed, other diversity-promoting factors differed for these species groups: the residual species-richness of lichens depended strongly on the relative area of mature forest on transects, while the residual species-richness of bryophytes was higher in commercial than protected forests. The latter was due to the lack of bryophyte-rich substrata in the reserve, since the small-scale richness of the same substrata there was similar to that in commercial forests. For cryptogam conservation, direct consideration of substratum diversity and co-occurrence is extremely important. If the substrata have scattered distributions or the substrata of different taxa are aggregated to different sites, conservation measures should not be based on one surrogate species group only.

AB  - This article discusses the environmental concerns about heavy metal accumulation in dominant forest mosses and dwarf shrubs. Samples of two different species of mosses, such as glittering wood moss (Hylocomium splendens) and feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi), and two species of dwarf shrubs, that is European blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), were collected from specifically chosen areas with evident anthropogenic pollution (vicinity of an airport and close to heavy road traffic) and from contamination-free, secluded forest areas in Lithuania and Sweden. Instrumental analysis of heavy metals, including cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc, revealed that the selected plant species tend to accumulate zinc and copper the most and chromium the least. Forest mosses, used as indicators of airborne pollution, accumulated less heavy metals than dwarf shrubs, indicating more metal accumulation from the soil. The results also revealed that forest, dwarf shrub leaves even picked from areas with known anthropogenic pollution sources were safe to use. since concentrations of cadmium and lead remained below the maximum permissible level. A multivariate data analysis model with two principle components explained more than 70% of the data variation. The heavy metal content in soil was the most distinctive factor separating the Lithuanian and Swedish sites. Cadmium and chromium soil contents were more significant in the Lithuanian soils, whereas copper, lead, and zinc were more significant in the Swedish soils.

AB  - Agricultural production and nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea are likely to increase following Poland's and the Baltic States' entrance into the EU. According to HELCOM these trends will be highly dependent on the agricultural policies of the EU. The expansion of the EU can be seen as a window of opportunity where agricultural policy could improve the Baltic Sea environment.
   Longstanding initiatives with local organic food systems and Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) in the eight EU-countries in the Baltic Sea drainage area were evaluated during 2001-2004. The empirical results were scaled up to calculate environmental impact and food production for three different scenarios. In one scenario the Baltic Countries and Poland convert their agriculture following the average Swedish production. This resulted in 58% increase of nitrogen and 18% increase in phosphorus surplus, a corresponding increase in the load to the Baltic Sea and increased food production. In two other scenarios agriculture production in the whole Baltic Sea drainage area converts to ERA. This halved the nitrogen surplus from agriculture and eliminated the surplus of phosphorus. In these scenarios food production would decrease or remain stable depending on strategy chosen. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European flat oyster Ostrea edulis is an economically and ecologically important species subjected to extensive protection and restoration efforts, due to sharp population declines in Europe. In Sweden, O. edulis occurs at the northern fringe of its range. Knowledge of the distribution and abundance of the species is limited, and the size of the population has never been estimated. Oyster fishery sustainability has never been assessed. Using a random sampling approach and towed video, we collected data on oyster occurrence at 435 sites to estimate abundance and distribution of O. edulis in the Swedish Skagerrak region. Furthermore, the size of the population was assessed and the current management and legislation strategy of the species was analyzed. Living O. edulis was found in 27% of all sampled sites above 6 m, and the size of the population was estimated to 36.6 +/- 16.3 million individuals (total population +/- SE). The distribution was patchy, and approximately 60% of the population was found in oyster bed densities (>= 5 oysters/m(2)), which corresponds to around 1% of the sampled sites. The nondestructive sampling method and representative design provided useful estimates of population size and error, which indicate that the marginal population of O. edulis in Sweden constitutes a significant part of the remaining European population. We argue that the relatively good status of the Swedish population can be explained by (a) private ownership of fishing rights, (b) a small-scale fishery that exploits <0.5% of the estimated population annually, conducted using nondestructive methods, and (c) parasite-free waters, potentially due to effective prevention of spread of infection.

AB  - The dynamic development and evolution that tourism has recently undergone and its growing importance made it become an important element of the policy of today's countries in various walks of social, economic and political life. As tourism is one of the largest industries in the world, most countries recognized the leading role in their economies, establishing in this regard the administrative structure of the national tourism organizations (NTOs). NTOs are responsible for the marketing and promotion of countries, improving the tourist image of a given country and supporting existing or developing new tourism products. At the same time, governments are increasingly realizing that tourism should develop in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and be integrated with the natural, cultural and social environment of these countries. This article presents the activities of selected national tourism organizations (NTOs) in terms of their role in developing the potential of sustainable tourism (and within it sustainable transport) in their countries. The aim of the article is to review the promotional activities undertaken by NTOs operating in countries such as Austria, Cyprus, Grenada, Guatemala, Norway and Indonesia. The article is an overview, and the following sources were used to prepare it: official websites of the organizations, reports, promotional materials and any documents related to the operation of the studied NTOs in the field of sustainable tourism and sustainable transport development (e.g., tourism development strategies, tourism product development strategies, projects and programs). The choice of these countries for the analysis was dictated by the fact that they have outstanding natural and cultural assets that make up the product potential for sustainable tourism and the very responsible, diverse and long-term promotional and marketing activities undertaken by the NTOs (e.g., promotional campaigns). Such prudent treatment of own resources and sustainable potential may also contribute to these countries gaining a competitive advantage over other destinations in the world (e.g., increase in interest from tourists). The activities and promotional campaigns cited in the article as well as the solutions proposed by NTOs can also become excellent examples of good practice for other destinations in the world. The research has also shown that the studied countries (and their national tourism organizations) clearly support the development of sustainable tourism and sustainable transport through their national tourism policies.

AB  - Knowledge on population dynamics of ecosystem's key species is invaluable to understand how populations will respond to natural and human-induced perturbations. The amphipod Echinogammarus marinus is a key-species from European estuarine habitats with a distribution ranging from Norway to Portugal [1]. The present article contains supportive data related to a research article entitled 'Comparing production and life-history traits of a key amphipod species within and between estuaries under different levels of anthropogenic pressure' [2]. The present dataset presents the density, biomass, fecundity, and production of E. marinus in three estuaries under different anthropogenic pressure and, within each estuary, at three sampling sites, which differed in terms of the distance to the estuary mouth, vegetation cover, and organic matter content. Monthly environmental abiotic data and seasonal concentration of PAH and other contaminants are also provided. Sampling took place monthly for 13 months at low tide on intertidal mudflats. At each site, Fucus fronds containing E. marinus individuals were randomly collected. All E. marinus individuals were counted, sexed, and measured under a binocular stereo microscope to estimate the density and the biomass of E. marinus in Fucus fronds. Finally, the annual production of E. marinus at each sampling site was estimated through the size frequency method. This dataset may be used to compare population traits of E. marinus populations across different estuaries and it may overall assist designing studies regarding population dynamics and designing management strategies in coastal systems, namely targeting at habitat conservation and restoration.

AB  - Municipalities in Sweden use public land development to engage public and private actors in collaborative urban experimentation and innovation to create public value. This points to a wider scope of potential and current utility for public land development than previously theorised. The aim of this paper is to investigate municipalities' use of public land development to enable and structure public value co-creation, and to provide suggestions for enhancing public value. Findings are based on a multiple case study of five flagship urban development projects located in different municipalities in Sweden. We illustrate how municipalities co-design public value propositions with different public and private actors, which aretranslated into criteria for choosing developers to allocate land to and project-specific requirements for housing development. When co-designing public value propositions and subsequent requirements, the main role of the municipality is to form arenas where relevant actors can collaboratively find creative solutions to emerging problems rooted in value conflicts. Findings align with previous research on public value co-creation in other contexts, demonstrating an appropriate application of the theory and potential for further theoretical development across research fields.

AB  - Clovers, such as red clover (Trifolium pratens), are often cultivated with grass in Northern Europe. Clover forages are suitable for sustainable low-input or organic dairying, since they require less nitrogen fertilization, while providing higher protein content in feed, than pure hay grasses. A partial equilibrium, economic sector model was used in analyzing land use and production effects of measures promoting clover-grasses, in forage production, in Finland. Reduced costs, higher clover-grass yield levels, premium payments for clover-grasses, and fertilizer taxes could increase clover-grass areas and feed use. The results suggest that premium payments for clover-grass areas or reduced costs may have little effect, while fertilizer taxes and higher yield levels of clover are more likely to result in significantly increased clover-grass production. We also found that the effectiveness of clover-grass promotion measures is highly dependent on crop and livestock product prices, as well as fertilizer prices. However, the potential for increasing clover-grass is limited due to, e.g., manure spreading requirements. It was found that it is hard to increase clover-grass area above 30%, from the current 15%, of overall grassland area in Finland. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years the tide of interest in ecocities is rising in China. The symbiotic integration of digital city and ecological city is the new model of urban development in the future. Gongqing DigiEcoCity is a strategic cooperation project between China and Finland to improve the living environment and build an ecological civilization. The paper defines the concept of DigiEcoCity and the practice of Gongqing DigiEcoCity supported by Finland in technology. Further, the paper explores the technological integration of digital city and ecocity from three aspects: Digi-concepts, Eco-concepts, City-concepts. Especially, the scalable, localisable and replicable Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for Gongqing DigiEcoCity planning are put forward and discussed to testify its ecological suitability and livability. The paper argues that Gongqing DigiEcoCity is a model for an ideal city combining the principles of sustainable development, the innovations by the digital revolution and the urban functions necessary for providing a framework of good everyday life. The paper also argues that the concept of developing digiecocity requires not only the successful completion of a project and planning, but also the long-term maintenance in the practice and their acceptance by the public.

AB  - Snowmelt is known to cause peak concentrations of pollutants, which may adversely affect receiving water quality. High concentrations of metals and suspended solids in snow have been reported, whereas studies on organic pollutants are rare. This study aims at investigating the occurrence of anthropogenic organic compounds in urban snow in Gothenburg (Sweden). The most frequently detected organic pollutants in the collected snow samples were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), high molecular-weight phthalates, 4-nonylphenol and 4-t-octylphenol. Brominated flame retardants and chlorinated paraffins were only sporadically detected. In several snow samples, the concentrations of specific PAHs, alkylphenols and phthalates were higher than reported stormwater concentrations and European water quality standards. Pollutant source identification and sustainable management of snow are important instruments for the mitigation of organic contaminants in the urban environment.

AB  - Translocation of dead wood is a novel method for ecological compensation and restoration that could, potentially, provide a new important tool for biodiversity conservation. With this method, substrates that normally have long delivery times are instantly created in a compensation area, and ideally many of the associated dead wood dwelling organisms are translocated together with the substrates. However, to a large extent, there is a lack of knowledge about the cost efficiency of different methods of ecological compensation. Therefore, the costs for different parts of a translocation process and its dependency on some influencing factors were studied. The observed cost was 465 SEK per translocated log for the actual compensation measure, with an additional 349 SEK/log for work to enable evaluation of the translocation's ecological results. Based on time studies, models were developed to predict required work time and costs for different transportation distances and load sizes. Those models indicated that short extraction and insertion distances for logs should be prioritized over road transportation distances to minimize costs. They also highlighted a trade-off between costs and time until a given ecological value is reached in the compensation area. The methodology used can contribute to more cost-efficient operations and, by doing so, increase the use of ecological compensation and the benefits from a given input.

AB  - The Arctic faces high expectations of Blue Growth due to future projections of easier access and increased biological productivity. These expectations are, however, often based on global and regional climate change projections and largely ignore the complexity of social-ecological interactions taking place across different temporal and spatial scales. This paper illustrates how such cross-scale interactions at, and across, different dimensions (e.g., ecological, socioeconomic and governance) can affect the development of Arctic fisheries; and potentially create uncertainties for future Blue Growth projections. Two Arctic marine systems, The Barents Sea and the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO), are used as focus areas. The former hosts productive fisheries and is mostly covered by the EEZs of Norway and Russia, while the latter is still mainly covered by sea-ice and is a high seas area with no multilevel governance system in place. The examples show that, both systems are affected by a number of processes, beyond the environmental change, spanning a wide range of dimensions, as well as spatial and temporal scales. To address the complexity of the Arctic marine systems calls for an increase in holistic scientific understanding together with adaptive management practices. This is particularly important in the CAO, where no robust regional management structures are in place. Recognizing how cross-scale dynamics can cause uncertainties to the current fisheries projections and implementing well-functioning adaptive management structures across different Arctic sub-systems can play a key role in whether the Blue Growth potential in Arctic fisheries is realized or lost.

AB  - Roads may act as barriers to animal movements, but direct barrier effects on insects have rarely been studied. In this study we collected data on bees and wasps along two sides of a large road in Sweden using yellow pan traps. We then analyzed if the species composition differed between the two sides of the road; first for the whole community, and then only for the smallest species (which typically are poorer dispersers). As a complement, we analyzed if different vegetation variables differed between the two sides of the road, as this may also affect differences in species composition. Finally, we analyzed if species richness and abundance in general differed between the two sides and how these two response variables were explained by the vegetation variables. There was a significant difference in species composition between the eastern and the western side of the road when analyzing the whole community, and this relationship became even stronger when the largest species were excluded. The vegetation variables did not strongly differ between the two sides, and there was no difference in species richness and abundance of bees and wasps either. Abundance was, however, explained by the number of flowering plants in the surroundings of the trap. Even though using a rather limited data set, our results indicate that large roads may act as barriers on the movement of bees and wasps, especially for small species with poor dispersal ability. On the other hand, road verges may be important habitat for many species, which leads to a potential conflict that is important to consider in the planning of green infrastructure.

AB  - We examined territory occupancy (n = 161; 720 breeding attempts) of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in western Finland in 1983-1996. Nest sites of goshawks were characterized by old forests. The proportion of longstanding goshawk territories declined steeply from the beginning of the 1990s, while occasionally occupied goshawk territories became common. We suggest that the longstanding occupancy of the same territory, typical for goshawks, has decreased at least partly because of the logging of mature forests, which are preferred nesting habitats of goshawks. The mean occupancy rate of all goshawk territories, however, did not change through the study period, which suggests that the size of the breeding population has been constant.

AB  - Poorer citizens are often more exposed to environmental hazards due to spatial inequalities in the distribution of urbanblue-green space. Few cities have managed to prevent spatial and social inequality despite sustainable developmentstrategies like compact city planning. We explore whether environmental injustice exists in a city where one wouldleast expect tofind it: a city with abundant nature, an affluent population governed by a left leaning social democraticcity council, andan aggressive densification strategy;Oslo, Norway.Green spacewas measured with a satellite-derivedvegetation index which captures the combined availability of gardens, street trees, parks and forest. Blue space wasdefined by the proximity of residential areas to the closest lake, river or fjord. We found that poorer city districts,often with greater immigrant populations, have less available blue-green spaces and are disproportionately exposedto hazardous air pollution levels, but not extreme heat compared to wealthier city districts. Citizens living within100 m of a water body are likely to earn US$ 20,000 more per year than citizens living 500 m away from water,and a US$ 3000 increase in annual income corresponds to a 10 % increase in green space availability. Hazardousair pollution concentrations in the poorest city districts were above levels recommended by the WHO and Oslo munic-ipality. Historical trends showed that districts undergoing population densification coincide with the lowest availabil-ity of blue-green space, suggesting that environmental justice has been overlooked in compact city planning policy.Despite Oslo's affluence and egalitarian ideals, the patterns of inequality we observed mirror the city's historicaleast-west class divide and point to spatial concentration of wealth as a core factor to consider in studies of green seg-regation. Urban greening initiatives in Oslo and other cities should not take spatial equality for granted, and insteadconsider socio-economic geographies in their planning process

AB  - Global climate change has been causing growing concern among conservationists for its strong implications on biodiversity alteration and loss at different levels of organization. Dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata) occur in habitats threatened by global warming, thus they represent an ideal model organism to study the correlation patterns of climate change with taxonomic composition and the ecological functioning of communities. We carried out climate and diachronic faunistic analyses of Odonata community changes in three countries (Tunisia, Mauritania, Sweden) to test if the patterns uncovered for single assemblages as a response to local climate change may resist to the generalization across regions and latitudes. Clear climate warming occurred in the analysed regions during the last five decades. We found three main patterns of diachronic shifts in Odonata assemblage species composition based on correlative evidence: i) Generalists are likely advantaged from warming processes that cause the loss of specific habitats (i.e. temporary wetlands, cool lentic waters) and the formation of new or altered habitats suitable for pioneer species (i.e. warm and intermittent pools), whereas specialists are more likely to go toward local extinctions; ii) In Tunisia and Sweden new colonizers expanded northward from their southern distributions; iii)The Odonata communities inhabiting lentic waters are more prone to show species turnover than communities from standing waters. Ow results provide new insights on the possible impact of climate change on Odonata fauna from large areas (i.e. countries) at different latitudes and represent an attempt of a generalization of the effects of climate change on Odonata range shifts and expansions. Despite that Odonata global assessment of conservation status has been completed, insufficient information is available to robustly assess all the main threats affecting their status, and extensive new field surveys are required to test if major changes in fauna composition have occurred during the last decades.

AB  - This article presents and evaluates arguments supporting that an approval procedure for genome-edited organisms for food or feed should include a broad assessment of societal, ethical and environmental concerns; so-called non-safety assessment. The core of analysis is the requirement of the Norwegian Gene Technology Act that the sustainability, ethical and societal impacts of a genetically modified organism should be assessed prior to regulatory approval of the novel products. The article gives an overview how this requirement has been implemented in the regulatory practice, demonstrating that such assessment is feasible and justified. Even in situations where genome-edited organisms are considered comparable to non-modified organisms in terms of risk, the technology may have-in addition to social benefits-negative impacts that warrant assessments of the kind required in the Act. The main reason is the disruptive character of the genome editing technologies due to their potential for novel, ground-breaking solutions in agriculture and aquaculture combined with the economic framework shaped by the patent system. Food is fundamental for a good life, biologically and culturally, which warrants stricter assessment procedures than what is required for other industries, at least in countries like Norway with a strong tradition for national control over agricultural markets and breeding programs.

AB  - Concerns over deteriorating water quality in both freshwater and marine waters have initiated efforts to control diffuse nitrogen (N) losses in all Nordic-Baltic countries. The national strategies for combating diffuse nitrogen losses including selection of mitigation measures, areal extent of measures and incentives for farmers to use the measures differ between the Nordic-Baltic countries. Effects of legislation and other incentives to change agricultural practices and hence to reduce N losses from agriculture are first observed by monitoring close to the source of these losses. Consequently, all Nordic-Baltic countries have set up monitoring programmes including small agriculturally dominated catchments where inputs, outputs and loss of N are followed closely at plot, field and/or catchment scale. We explore the connection between political decisions and regulations, provide an overview of measures and incentives used in the Nordic-Baltic countries, and assess the effect of the measures based on data from national monitoring programmes.

AB  - Each year the European Union designates one or more cities with the competed-for city brand of European Capital of Culture (ECOC). In several recent ECOCs, such as in Turku, Finland, the management and organisation of the events have caused tension among the citizens regarding decision-making, financing and power over use of the urban space. The focus of the article is on analysis of the discursive dynamics of local activists and their project Turku - European Capital of Subculture 2011'. By emphasising the cultural analysis of activism, the article indicates how the counter-discourse of the activists was produced through cultural production. The project produced a strong movement culture with common practices, anti-neoliberal values and world views. Through cultural production and movement culture, the project participated in the creation of subculture as a fluid and flexible cultural category expressed through stylistic and lifestyle choices.

AB  - The world is currently in the midst of an energy transition, in which renewable and low-carbon energy is replacing the use of fossil fuels. Along the way, however, planning for and adapting to impacts of climate change is urgently needed, as these are projected to intensify in the future, despite ambitious mitigation efforts. Since the low-carbon energy transition is likely to involve many international interdependencies and connections between countries and regions, assessments of cross-border impacts of climate change, i.e., consequences of climate change that occur remotely from the location of their initial impact, are of utmost importance to ensure the decarbonisation of society is safe and sustainable. This paper utilises expert interviews and a general morphological analysis with the shared socioeconomic pathways to situate national decarbonisation efforts within a global context and identify cross-border impacts of climate change that may affect the energy transition, using the Finnish energy sector as a case study. Interestingly, many of the global development trends that were found to have a boosting effect on the Finnish energy transition, also increased the risk from cross-border climate change impacts, stressing the importance of rigorous adaptation planning. The findings affirm the need for studying national energy transitions from a global perspective and highlight the tendency of climate change impacts to be transmitted across borders via complex pathways. The study offers valuable insights into the importance of cross-border impacts for adaptation planning pertinent to any country or region currently engaged, or planning to engage, in the global low-carbon transition.

AB  - The Norwegian government recently implemented a new management system to regulate salmon farming in Norway, aiming to promote environmentally sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry. The Norwegian coast has been divided into 13 production zones and the volume of salmonid production in the zones will be regulated based on salmon lice effects on wild salmonids. Here we present a model for assessing salmon louse-induced mortality of seaward-migrating post-smolts of Atlantic salmon. The model quantifies expected salmon lice infestations and louse-induced mortality of migrating post-smolt salmon from 401 salmon rivers draining into Norwegian coastal waters. It is assumed that migrating post-smolts follow the shortest path from river outlets to the high seas, at constant progression rates. During this migration, fish are infested by salmon lice of farm origin according to an empirical infestation model. Furthermore, louse-induced mortality is estimated from the estimated louse infestations. Rivers draining into production zones on the West Coast of Norway were at the highest risk of adverse lice effects. In comparison, rivers draining into northerly production zones, along with the southernmost production zone, were at lower risk. After adjusting for standing stock biomass, estimates of louse-egg output varied by factors of up to 8 between production zones. Correlation between biomass adjusted output of louse infestation and densities of farmed salmon in the production zones suggests that a large-scale density-dependent host-parasite effect is a major driver of louse infestation rates and parasite-induced mortality. The estimates are sensitive to many of the processes in the chain of events in the model. Nevertheless, we argue that the model is suited to assess spatial and temporal risks associated with farm-origin salmon lice.

AB  - Intensifying forest management and a reduction in the rotation period necessitates the development of intensive biodiversity conservation strategies, such as the triad concept, which aims at ensuring habitat connectivity. Such an approach depends on the relationships between biodiversity components and manageable stand characteristics. Mostly, the biological value of stands has been associated with age, although stand structures, which are often intercorrelated with age, might be of primary importance. The relationships between ground cover vegetation, which is a principal component and indicator of the biological value of temperate conifer forests, and stand characteristics were assessed in pre-harvesting/harvesting age and old-growth coniferous stands in the eastern Baltic region (Latvia). The old-growth stands were nearly two times older than the pre-harvesting/harvesting age stands. Both stand groups showed generally similar ground cover flora, though ground cover vegetation showed higher variability in the old-growth stands. The principal gradients of ground cover vegetation were related to light, site fertility, and structural diversity, as well as the degree of deciduous (particularly Betula spp.) admixture in a tree stand. Considering the explicit contrasts, stand age did not affect ground cover vegetation, implying the principal effects of stand structure, which are manageable characteristics. This implies the potential for specific management to aid the ecological connectivity of stands in commercial forest landscapes.

AB  - Due to stricter animal welfare regulations, in Norway tie stalls for dairy cows are banned from 2034 onwards. The aim of this paper is to explore the profitability and agricultural policy consequences associated with the transition from tie stalls to loose housing. Data on farm economics and investments were collected from farm enterprise budgets on 66 farms that have built new cowsheds in recent years in Vestland county. In Norway, many medium or large sized farms have already renewed or built new cowsheds with loose housing. However, many dairy farms have less than average and often scattered farmland, which makes it challenging to make investments in new cow-sheds profitable. To demonstrate the challenge facing these farms, Vestland was chosen because on average it has the smallest dairy farms in Norway, with 45 percent of the herds having less than 20 cows. To analyze profitability, we compared different farm sizes based on their expected rates of return, required investment, and anticipated revenue over time. The findings show that irrespective of herd size, to continue farming with an upgraded tie stall is more profitable than to invest in new loose housing. For farms with less than 30 cows, investment in new loose housing is on average not profitable. Unless the Governmental investment grant is significantly increased, the tie stall ban will have large consequences for farm structure and conflict several agricultural policy goals. Farmland in less favored areas may go out of production, making it more difficult to reach the policy goals of increasing food production, agriculture across the country, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and rural viability. Our findings are of interest to policymakers in countries where one considers stricter animal welfare regulations, as well as planners and farmers who consider investing in new loose housing dairies.

AB  - The Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem (BOBLME) is one of the largest and most important globally. In recent years Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand have come together to build consensus around a Strategic Action Programme (SAP) with the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) International Waters, Norway, Sweden and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). The Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) process identified a number of key issues including overexploitation of marine living resources, degradation of critical habitats and pollution and water quality. The TDA process identified several key drivers which contribute to these issues. These include socioeconomic drivers, institutional, legal and administrative drivers and climate change. The agreed SAP identified four key objectives including that fisheries and other marine living resources are restored and managed sustainably; degraded, vulnerable and critical marine habitats are restored, conserved and maintained; coastal and marine pollution and water quality are controlled to meet agreed standards for human and ecosystem health; and social and economic constraints are addressed, which should lead to increased resilience and empowerment of coastal people. Analysis of the BOBLME SAP shows that just over 70% of the identified activities are being undertaken to some extent by countries already. SAP implementation recognises the importance of approaches such as the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and the focus on Small Scale Fisheries. Whilst BOBLME countries vary considerably in their governance arrangements and capacity to implement, they recognise the importance of regional coordination and cooperation to address transboundary issues.

AB  - North Sweden ('Norrland' in Swedish) covers 243 000 km2 and lies mainly in the boreal biome. The herpetofauna comprises five amphibian and four reptile species: Lissotriton vulgaris, Triturus cristatus, Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria, Rana arvalis, Zootoca vivipara, Anguis fragilis, Natrix natrix, and Vipera berus.Successful conservation and management of amphibians and reptiles depend on accurate information about distribution, habitat affinities, and abundance. Such knowledge is also essential as a benchmark to assess changes in distribution and abundance that may come about as a result of climate change and human habitat alteration.This paper aims to present accurate distribution maps, describe habitat affinities, and provide abundance estimates for the herpetofauna of North Sweden for the period 1970-2022. Distribution data are presented by traditional faunistic provinces, as well as by biotic regions and alpine life zones. Separate sections address post-glacial colonization and a herpetological perspective on anthropogenic changes in relation to species & PRIME; present status.Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria, Rana arvalis, Zootoca vivipara, and Vipera berus are widely distributed throughout the boreal sub-regions. Rana temporaria, Zootoca vivipara, and Vipera berus also extend into the alpine region. Triturus cristatus, Anguis fragilis, and Natrix natrix occur mainly in the coastal parts of the Southern Boreal region. There are no signs of recent changes in distribution range, but Lissotriton vulgaris, Triturus cristatus, and Rana arvalis have been largely overlooked in the past and have a much wider occurrence than previously recognized. Most species are found in habitats usually not described in all-European field guides. Nearly all anurans hibernate in water. Abundance estimates suggest that some species are more common in the boreal than thought, supporting the notion that a large share of their total European population occurs there. Although local extinctions and declines are known, there are no signs of widespread population decline for any species during the study period.

AB  - Concerns over deteriorating water quality in both freshwater and marine waters have initiated efforts to control diffuse nitrogen (N) losses in all Nordic-Baltic countries. The national strategies for combating diffuse nitrogen losses including selection of mitigation measures, areal extent of measures and incentives for farmers to use the measures differ between the Nordic-Baltic countries. Effects of legislation and other incentives to change agricultural practices and hence to reduce N losses from agriculture are first observed by monitoring close to the source of these losses. Consequently, all Nordic-Baltic countries have set up monitoring programmes including small agriculturally dominated catchments where inputs, outputs and loss of N are followed closely at plot, field and/or catchment scale. We explore the connection between political decisions and regulations, provide an overview of measures and incentives used in the Nordic-Baltic countries, and assess the effect of the measures based on data from national monitoring programmes.

AB  - International bi-lateral agreements to support the conservation of rainforests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are growing in prevalence. In 2009, the governments of Guyana and Norway established Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). We examine the extent to which the participation and inclusion of Guyana's indigenous population within the LCDS is being achieved. We conducted a single site case study, focussing on the experiences and perceptions from the Amerindian community of Chenapou. Based on 30 interviews, we find that a deficit of adequate dialogue and consultation has occurred in the six years since the LCDS was established. Moreover, key indigenous rights, inscribed at both a national and international level, have not been upheld with respect to the community of Chenapou. Our findings identify consistent shortcomings to achieve genuine participation and the distinct and reinforced marginalisation of Amerindian communities within the LCDS. A further critique is the failure of the government to act on previous research, indicating a weakness of not including indigenous groups in the Guyana-Norway bi-lateral agreement. We conclude that, if the government is to uphold the rights of Amerindian communities in Guyana, significant adjustments are needed. A more contextualised governance, decentralising power and offering genuine participation and inclusion, is required to support the engagement of marginal forest-dependent communities in the management of their natural resources.

AB  - Climate change and increased anthropogenic activities are expected to elevate the potential of introducing nonindigenous species (NIS) into the Arctic. Yet, the knowledge base needed to identify gaps and priorities for NIS research and management is limited. Here, we reviewed primary introduction events to each ecoregion of the marine Arctic realm to identify temporal and spatial patterns, likely source regions of NIS, and the putative introduction pathways. We included 54 introduction events representing 34 unique NIS. The rate of NIS discovery ranged from zero to four species per year between 1960 and 2015. The Iceland Shelf had the greatest number of introduction events (n = 14), followed by the Barents Sea (n = 11), and the Norwegian Sea (n = 11). Sixteen of the 54 introduction records had no known origins. The majority of those with known source regions were attributed to the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, 19 and 14 records, respectively. Some introduction events were attributed to multiple possible pathways. For these introductions, vessels transferred the greatest number of aquatic NIS (39%) to the Arctic, followed by natural spread (30%) and aquaculture activities (25%). Similar trends were found for introductions attributed to a single pathway. The phyla Arthropoda and Ochrophyta had the highest number of recorded introduction events, with 19 and 12 records, respectively. Recommendations including vector management, horizon scanning, early detection, rapid response, and a pan-Arctic biodiversity inventory are considered in this paper. Our study provides a comprehensive record of primary introductions of NIS for marine environments in the circumpolar Arctic and identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities for NIS research and management. Ecosystems worldwide will face dramatic changes in the coming decades due to global change. Our findings contribute to the knowledge base needed to address two aspects of global change-invasive species and climate change.

AB  - In many countries, cities are expected to stimulate compact city development by the government, while at the same time develop healthier and more social sustainable cities. In Norway, national policy and planning regulation aim at stimulating a development that ensures active urban childhoods. In order to ensure this, the Planning and Building Act ensure particular participation rights for children and youth in the planning process. In this article, we will present how these rights are understood and implemented in practice. Then we will discuss how local government can enable children to participate in a meaningful way and where their input actually contributes to the plans and urban design being developed. This last discussion will be elaborated by studying a case about the Children Track Methodology.

AB  - E-commerce is becoming an increasingly visible feature of modern society that places increasing strain on transport systems. Research has hitherto paid substantial attention to ways in which e-commerce might modify personal travel behaviour but has been less attentive to the ramifications of e-commerce for urban freight. Although contemporary conditions of urban freight are increasingly scrutinised by scholars in several disciplines, this study peeks into the future of urban freight from the scholarly perspective of sustainability transitions. Specifically, we investigate what expectations Norwegian freight providers hold for the transition pathways of their own sector. We find that the Norwegian urban freight sector expects technological shifts to be most prominent, pointing to the replacement of vans and lorries with low-emission models. Conversely, although deemed important enough, the urban freight sector orients less towards behavioural shifts that enhance efficiencies within and across freight providers. To ensure more transformative effects in the transition pathways of urban freight, we thus advise decision-makers in urban planning to establish inclusive approaches to policy making that enhance the legitimacy of technological and behavioural shifts in urban freight alike.

AB  - Oil tanker traffic constitutes a vital part of the maritime operations in the High North and is associated with considerable risk to the environment. As a consequence, the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) administers a number of vessel traffic services (VTS) centers along the Norwegian coast, one of which is located in the town of Vardo, in the extreme northeast part of Norway. The task of the operators at the VTS center in Vardo is to command a fleet of tug vessels patrolling the northern Norwegian coastline such that the risk of oil tanker drifting accidents is reduced. Currently, these operators do not use computer algorithms or mathematical models to solve this dynamic resource allocation problem but rely on their own knowledge and experience when faced with constantly changing weather and traffic conditions. We therefore propose a novel sustainable model called the receding horizon mixed integer programming (RHMIP) model for optimal dynamic allocation of patrol vessels to oil tankers. The model combines features from model predictive control and linear programming. Simulations run with real-world parameters highlight the performance and quality of our method. The developed RHMIP model can be implemented as an operational decision support tool to the NCA.

AB  - Anthropogenic deforestation has shaped ecosystems worldwide. In subarctic ecosystems, primarily inhabited by native peoples, deforestation is generally considered to be mainly associated with the industrial period. Here we examined mechanisms underlying deforestation a thousand years ago in a high-mountain valley with settlement artifacts located in subarctic Scandinavia. Using the Heureka Forestry Decision Support System, we modeled pre-settlement conditions and effects of tree cutting on forest cover. To examine lack of regeneration and present nutrient status, we analyzed soil nitrogen. We found that tree cutting could have deforested the valley within some hundred years. Overexploitation left the soil depleted beyond the capacity of re-establishment of trees. We suggest that pre-historical deforestation has occurred also in subarctic ecosystems and that ecosystem boundaries were especially vulnerable to this process. This study improves our understanding of mechanisms behind human-induced ecosystem transformations and tree-line changes, and of the concept of wilderness in the Scandinavian mountain range.

AB  - Rodenticides are an essential tool in the integrated pest management of infestations of commensal rodents (Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, and Mus musculus). With the introduction of Assembly Bill 1788, the California Ecosystems Protection Act of 2019, California is potentially facing a future with new restrictions on the use of anticoagulant rodenticides to manage commensal rodents in urban areas. Assembly Bill 1788 has been proposed specifically to protect predators from anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning and seeks to restrict the application of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) for use in many urban and non-urban areas of California, USA. Exclusion and cultural practices, such as landscape management and sanitation (i.e., cleaning of property including but not limited to trash containment and removal, and drain sanitation), remain important and successful tools for managing rodent populations. However, increased exposure of wildlife to anticoagulant rodenticides has been detected California. Several animal species have been documented as having succumbed to rodenticide toxicosis. When rodents are killed by SGARs and consumed by predators, SGAR residues have been detected in the livers of predatory species. However, the effects of chronic, sublethal exposure to predators are not well understood. We discuss the current and proposed changes to rodenticide legislation in California, impacts of rodenticide to wildlife, and the potential effects of restrictions on wildlife. We discuss limitations to rodent management programs that have historically replied on the use of SGARs and the potential impacts of the proposed legislation on communities across California. We also identify research gaps that are impeding the adoption of evidence-based best management strategies for rodent control. To improve the success of commensal rodent control programs in California, more research is needed to develop effective strategies for rodent management.

AB  - Efforts to make novice drivers drive more safely on slippery roads by means of special courses have mainly failed. In order to understand why the courses have failed, the views of instructors and students on the goals of skid training courses were compared. The importance given to anticipating vs manoeuvring skills was analysed. After completing a skid training course, students in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) assessed manoeuvring skills to be equally important to anticipating skills in the courses. However, instructors assessed anticipating skills to be more important than manoeuvring skills. The differences between the assessments of instructors and students were the same in all four countries. Manoeuvring exercises are widely used in the courses although the main purpose of these courses is to develop anticipating skills. The exercises may give students the impression that manoeuvring skills are more important than anticipating skills. Manoeuvring exercises also increase their self-confidence and may lead to underestimation of the risks involved,resulting in e.g. driving at higher speed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This article continues the discussion on creativity in human geographical research. Drawing on Alain Badiou's writing on two theatres, I argue that the theatre-research cooperation as a landscape in motion can bring about creative landscapes. In this article, I discuss a collaborative project of participatory research and theatre that tested drama as a tool for urban planning. In the beginning of the project, theatre appears as a tool of inclusive exclusive politics: the research aims to deal with inter-cultural relations in a hypothetical planning situation and, further, on theatre's potential to motivate those who usually do not participate in planning. Thus, this initial setting is the first theatre in which the elements of a constellation are seen as static. However, during the process, there were moments of doubt, dealing with the representational politics of multiculturalism. Contrary to Badiou's first theatre, in the second theatre the elements are vivid and capable of breaking the state of a situation. This rupture occurs in the second theatre w hen the spectators feel uncomfortable in their seats, or here when the participatory researcher feel their aims generate an inconvenience. It is in the event that theatre changes from being of the state to saying something about the state. This change represents a rupture in thinking, and brings forth the creative landscape of the theatre-research cooperation.

AB  - We present a quantitative reconstruction of local forest history at two sites, Stavsakra (hemiboreal zone) and Storasjo (southern boreal zone), in southern Sweden (province of Smaland) to evaluate possible causes of contrasting Holocene fire histories in mid- and late Holocene. The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) is applied to evaluate between-site differences in the relative abundance of deciduous trees and Pinus (pine) and landscape/woodland openness during the Holocene. The LRA estimates of local vegetation abundance are compared with other proxies of local vegetation, that is, plant and beetle remains. The LRA results suggest that Pinus was a major tree taxon in the woodlands of Storasjo during mid- and late Holocene, while Tilia (linden) and Betula (birch) were dominant at Stavsakra. The contrasting fire histories are shown to be strongly related to between-site differences in tree composition during mid-Holocene, 4000-2000 bc in particular. The archaeological/historical and beetle data indicate contrasting land uses from c. 1000 bc (late Bronze Age/early Iron Age), grazing in open Calluna heaths at Stavsakra and woodland grazing at Storasjo. Between-site differences in fire history during late Holocene were likely due to different land-use practices. Between-site differences in tree composition in mid-Holocene are best explained by local climatic and geological/geomorphological differences between the hemiboreal and southern boreal zones of Smaland, which might also be the primary cause of between-site differences in land-use histories during late Holocene. Maintenance of biodiversity at the landscape scale in the study area requires that existing old pine woodlands and Calluna heath are managed with fire and cattle grazing. Further climate warming might lead to higher probabilities of climate-induces fire, in particular in pine-dominated woodlands.

AB  - The analysis of undisturbed sediment cores is a powerful tool for understanding spatial and temporal impacts of anthropogenic emissions from the energy and transport sectors at a regional scale. The spatial and vertical distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and black carbon (BC) were determined in 12 cores of recent (up to 20 cm long) sediments from the Gulf of Gdansk in Poland, and Oslofjord/Drammensfjord in Norway. The Sigma 12PAHs levels in individual sediment layers varied from 250 to 4500 ng/g d.w. in the Gulf of Gdansk, and from 210 to 4580 ng/g d.w. in the Norwegian fjords. Analysis of PAH ratios indicates that PAHs in both studied areas originated mainly from pyrogenic sources. The BC concentrations in sediments were up to 0.9% and were generally higher in the Gulf of Gdansk (mean - 0.39%) than in Oslofjord/Drammensfjord (mean - 0.19%). The deposition history of anthropogenic emissions over the last 100 years was reconstructed based on the analysis of dated and well-laminated sediment cores from two stations from the Gulf of Gdansk and two stations from the Norwegian fjords. The evolution in energy structure was especially evident in the Oslofjord, where transition from fossil fuel combustion to hydropower after 1960 coincided with a sharp decrease in sedimentary PAHs. Despite significant changes in the economic development in Poland, temporal patterns in PAH concentrations/profiles in the Gulf of Gdansk were not as obvious. The historical PAH trends in the Gulf of Gdansk may be related to the overwhelming PAH inputs from domestic combustion of solid fuels (coal, wood) for heating purposes. The implementation of legislation and other activities addressed to restrict the use of solid fuels in residential heating should reduce PAH emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of adaptation to climate change and spatial planning, the idea of urban and regional resilience has been attracting increasing attention because it recognizes both the given uncertainty of climate change and the complexity of cities and regions. Even if initial attempts have been made to operationalize the concept of resilience, a gap exists between the intense theoretical discussion and the use of resilience thinking in planning practice. On the basis of a discussion of existing attempts that define resilience principles, the authors derive eight principles for urban and regional resilience: diversity, redundancy, flexibility and adaptability, modularity, interdependency, stabilizing and buffering factors, mobility, as well as planning and foresight. Referring to two exploratory studiesthe City and Region of Stockholm (Sweden) and the City and Region of Rostock (Germany)this article aims to explore whether spatial planning already contributes to these principles and so to build resilience. The analysis shows that spatial planning already contributes to urban and regional resilience. Also, the principles, as suggested here, can be used to operationalize the idea of resilience. Prospectively, such principles may support spatial planning to choose adaptation measures and specific objectives and to contribute to urban and regional resilience.

AB  - The European Farmland Bird Indicator (EFBI) has been adopted as a Structural and Sustainable Development Indicator by the European Union. It is an aggregated index integrating the population trends of 33 common bird species associated with farmland habitats across 21 countries. We describe a modelling method for predicting this indicator from land-use characteristics. Using yearly historical land-use data of crop areas derived from the FAO databases (1990-2007) and published population data of farmland birds at the national level for the same period, we developed a series of multiple regression models to predict the trend of the EU state specific indicator, and the EFBI. These models incorporated up to 4 parameters and were selected based upon the significance (p < 0.05) of the model inputs with respect to the predictive variable. 17 separate models were developed in total for each of 14 EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland, and a separate model for the EU level indicator. The selected models were then implemented to predict the EFBI in the year 2025, using scenarios of land-use change generated by the CAPRI agricultural model. The uncertainty of using the regression models is discussed with respect to predicting the likely impacts of land-use change on bird populations. This work lays the framework for future modelling of farmland birds at the international scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet the sustainable development goals and enable sustainable management and protection of peatlands, there is a strong need for improving the mapping of peatlands. Here we present a novel approach to identify peat soils based on a high-resolution digital soil moisture map that was produced by combining airborne laser scanning-derived terrain indices and machine learning to model soil moisture at 2 m spatial resolution across the Swedish landscape. As soil moisture is a key factor in peat formation, we fitted an empirical relationship between the thickness of the organic layer (measured at 5479 soil plots across the country) and the continuous SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Science) soil moisture map (R-2 = 0.66, p < 0.001). We generated categorical maps of peat occurrence using three different definitions of peat (30, 40, and 50 cm thickness of the organic layer) and a continuous map of organic layer thickness. The predicted peat maps had a higher overall quality (MCC = 0.69-0.73) compared to traditional Quaternary deposits maps (MCC = 0.65) and topographical maps (MCC = 0.61) and captured the peatlands with a recall of ca. 80 % compared to 50 %-70 % on the traditional maps. The predicted peat maps identified more peatland area than previous maps, and the areal coverage estimates fell within the same order as upscaling estimates from national field surveys. Our method was able to identify smaller peatlands resulting in more accurate maps of peat soils, which was not restricted to only large peatlands that can be visually detected from aerial imagery - the historical approach of mapping. We also provided a continuous map of the organic layer, which ranged 6-88 cm organic layer thickness, with an R-2 of 0.67 and RMSE (root mean square error) of 19 cm. The continuous map exhibits a smooth transition of organic layers from mineral soil to peat soils and likely provides a more natural representation of the distribution of soils. The continuous map also provides an intuitive uncertainty estimate in the delineation of peat soils, critically useful for sustainable spatial planning, e.g., greenhouse gas or biodiversity inventories and landscape ecological research.

AB  - Models that predict forest development are essential for sustainable forest management. Constructing growth models via regression analysis or fitting a family of sigmoid equations to construct compatible growth and yield models are two ways these models can be developed. In this study, four species-specific models were developed and compared. A compatible growth and yield stand basal area model and a five-year stand basal area growth model were developed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The models were developed using data from permanent inventory plots from the Swedish national forest inventory and long-term experiments. The species-specific models were compared, using independent data from long-term experiments, with a stand basal area growth model currently used in the Swedish forest planning system Heureka (Elfving model). All new models had a good, relatively unbiased fit. There were no apparent differences between the models in their ability to predict basal area development, except for the slightly worse predictions for the Norway spruce growth model. The lack of difference in the model comparison showed that despite the simplicity of the compatible growth and yield models, these models could be recommended, especially when data availability is limited. Also, despite using more and newer data for model development in this study, the currently used Elfving model was equally good at predicting basal area. The lack of model difference indicate that future studies should instead focus on model development for heterogeneous forests which are common but lack in growth and yield modelling research.

CP  - 24th Annual Conference of the International-Association-of-Aquatic-and-Marine-Science-Libraries-and-Information-Centers / 17th Polar Libraries Colloquy
AB  - Co-operation between libraries in the Barents Region has now stepped into a new era: Berenice Centre has initiated its activities. Funding from the European Union Interreg II-programme together with national funding from Sweden and Finland made it possible, The total amount is about 3,5 million Finnish marks and this project will last until the end of June 1999.
   The Barents Region's library system is distinctive in Europe in that it is a comprehensive network providing universal access to information and culture. This library system includes all types of libraries from the very smallest village libraries to university libraries, from special libraries to central national libraries. Every person regardless of social, economic or educational status may use all the services free of charge in any library. Each library functions as a node in the open information network.
   The Berenice Centre was founded in the Barents Region to study differing attitudes to information, how library status and practices differ and how the perception of an informed society and its implementation differ in countries of European Union and its neighbors. The aim of augmented cooperation within the Barents region is to increase the availability of information. The task of the Berenice project is to assemble and distribute information about libraries and information services, expand the use of modern technology, develop the functions of libraries and ensure continuing education. Berenice may then function as a model for other library and information technologies within other European regions.
   The main idea is to build up networks to connect Barents regions librarians across all the different boundaries in the area: the border between East and West, national borders, European Union boundaries, language barriers, diverse cultures, economic and administrative diversity. Networks will be built to connect also librarians from other remote regions in Europe with Barents librarians.
   The research focus will be libraries and information services, with particular emphasis on the application of multimedia and telematic resources. Experimental projects will be designed to enhance library and information services. The emphasis of the activities is on four different areas:
   - continuing education and research related with libraries (incl. Barents Library School)
   - Sami and other cultural minorities (e.g. a common bibliography)
   - collection work, especially sounds and pictures
   - boarder-crossing co-operation within IT
   Berenice acts like an umbrella over these four areas which are divided into smaller projects. Berenice as an umbrella will also try to convene all related library projects in Barents area. The European dimension of Berenice will mostly be seen in the functioning by Barents Library School. It is planned that these special further education courses would be open to interested librarians in other remote areas in Europe.
   Berenice coordinators are working with their own areas of responsibility. One coordinator will work for Sami I Jokkmokk, Sweden. The others work in their own countries Sweden and Finland. A. steering group consists of members from Sweden, Finland and Sami. The Administrative Committee of the Barents Interreg II-programme supervises the whole project. The vision is for the Berenice - Barents' library network to continue its operations at the close of the project.

AB  - Cessation of grazing is an increasing threat to the biodiversity rich semi-natural pastures in Sweden due to a decreased number of grazing livestock despite environmental payments for management of these pastures. The aim of this study is to compare the profitability of raising beef breed calves as intact bulls kept indoors after weaning and slaughtered at 15 months to raising them as steers grazing semi-natural pastures and slaughtered at 20, 25 or 30 months of age. The 20 and 25 month steers graze one summer and the 30 month steers two summers post-weaning. Profitability is calculated as gross margin to cover fixed costs of the farm and background data is obtained from an animal experiment and official Swedish standard budgets. The comparisons include alternatives with holdings situated in one out of two districts (plain or forest) and with one out of six types of semi-natural pasture (low-or high-yielding pasture, pasture with payment on a base level only or with extra payment for special values, 100% semi-natural pasture or 50% semi-natural pasture with 50% complementary ley pasture). The result suggests that the 30 month steer is the most profitable production system in most of the studied alternatives provided that the present environmental payments, single farm payment and support for less favoured areas are maintained. Bulls are more profitable than 30 month steers only if the semi-natural pasture is both high-yielding and entitled payment on a base level only. The 20 and 25 month steers have no economical competitiveness in any of the alternatives studied. Steers with two post-weaning grazing seasons seem to be a cost-efficient way to preserve the grazing dependent biodiversity in Sweden and other parts of Europe with increasing shortage of calves.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between different types of multilevel governance systems and policy coherence (i.e., uniformity of goals and rules) through a study of the governance systems for water and large carnivores in Sweden. The study objects represent multilevel governance systems for contested natural resources in the same national context, although in different policy areas and with substantial differences in institutional arrangements. We define the characteristics of each governance system through an institutional analysis of official records and compare their perceived ability to promote coherence through a statistical analysis of survey data. Our empirical results both support and problematize common ideas about how different institutional features relate to policy coherence in multilevel governance. The results clearly indicate that multilevel governance systems are challenged by conflicting goals and rules, both within and across governance systems, and that the capacity to address these difficulties is generally perceived as wanting in both types of systems. The results tentatively suggest that clashes with other governance systems are more prominent in polycentric and ecologically based systems, whereas internal goal and rule conflicts are more prevalent in centralized and more traditionally organized systems. The findings contribute to our understanding of the quandaries associated with the design of new governance systems. The study also contributes important insights into what features to focus on in attempts to mitigate the downsides of different institutional arrangements in multilevel governance systems.

AB  - Recovering or threatened carnivore populations are often harvested to minimise their impact on human activities, such as livestock farming or game hunting. Increasingly, harvest quota decisions involve a set of scientific, administrative and political institutions operating at national and sub-national levels whose interactions and collective decision-making aim to increase the legitimacy of management and ensure population targets are met. In practice, however, assessments of how quota decisions change between these different actors and what consequences these changes have on population trends are rare. We combine a state-space population modelling approach with an analysis of quota decisions taken at both regional and national levels between 2007 and 2018 to build a set of decision-making models that together predict annual harvest quota values for Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Norway. We reveal a tendency for administrative decision-makers to compensate for consistent quota increases by political actors, particularly when the lynx population size estimate is above the regional target. Using population forecasts based on the ensemble of decision-making models, we show that such buffering of political biases ensures lynx population size remains close to regional and national targets in the long term. Our results go beyond the usual qualitative assessment of collaborative governance systems for carnivore management, revealing a system of checks and balances that, in the case of lynx in Norway, ensures both multi-stakeholder participation and sustainable harvest quotas. Nevertheless, we highlight important inter-regional differences in decision-making and population forecasts, the socio-ecological drivers of which need to be better understood to prevent future population declines. Synthesis and applications. Our work analyses the sequence of decisions leading to yearly quotas for lynx harvest in Norway, highlighting the collaborative and structural processes that together shape harvest sustainability. In doing so, we provide a predictive framework to evaluate participatory decision-making processes in wildlife management, paving the way for scientists and decision-makers to collaborate more widely in identifying where decision biases might lie and how institutional arrangements can be optimised to minimise them. We emphasise, however, that this is only possible if wildlife management decisions are documented and transparent.

AB  - Declines in Alnus coinciding with the first signs of Iron Age (A.D. 0-1150) human activities were found in the pollen stratigraphies of five small lakes in southern Finland. One lake did not show a clear minimum. Three of the lakes were investigated with close-interval analyses which showed that the Alnus minimum lasted for several centuries. The results were compared with 41 previously published pollen diagrams with evidence of Iron Age human activity from southern Finland. These diagrams were classified in three ways: (1) showing no Alnus minimum; (2) cases where a minimum was unclear; (3) showing a clear minimum in Alnus. The different types were found randomly scattered around southern Finland suggesting that Alnus minima were a local phenomenon. In most cases the Alnus minimum took place between ca. A.D. 600 and ca. A.D. 1000, A.D. 1300 being the latest date for the end of the minimum. The results do not suggest a pathogen outbreak over the entire area. The beginning of the minimum clearly coincides with the onset of Iron Age anthropogenic activities suggesting that these were the probable cause. Pollen analysis provides little information as to why trees were felled thus archaeological evidence is needed. However, the Alnus decline may prove a new and useful indicator of the onset of Iron Age anthropogenic activity in pollen diagrams.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban growth is increasing worldwide and Europe is now one of the most urbanized continents in the world. Oslo is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe. This creates pressure on its infrastructure, including traffic and environmental urban quality. Additionally, vehicular traffic is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, which affects climate change. It is recognized that air quality is a major factor for human health, however, although different measures have been implemented, improving air quality and lowering carbon emissions still remains an unsolved problem in Oslo.
   The main objective of Citi-Sense-MOB is to demonstrate how using innovative technology to continuously measure air quality at the road level combined with innovative Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help to create a dynamic city infrastructure for real-time city management, access to personalized environmental information and sustainable development. The output from the project will be mobile services for citizens and authorities based on the use of near real-time data on air quality and CO2 emissions at road level.
   The societal importance of these services arises from a need to mitigate the effects of air pollution and climate change, and to combat respiratory diseases related to traffic air pollution.
   In order to motivate citizens to use the information generated by the project, Citi-Sense-MOB will provide them with personalized environmental information, for instance alerting systems when pollution levels exceed a critical threshold. Furthermore, customized information will also be provided to authorities consisting of detailed air quality maps at high spatial resolution and an evaluation of possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions by improving driving practices in public urban fleets.

AB  - Aim: Biodiversity loss is a major driver of ecosystem change, yet the ecological data required to detect and mitigate losses are often lacking. Recently, camera trap surveys have been suggested as a method for sampling local wildlife communities, because these observations can be collated into a global monitoring network. To demonstrate the potential of camera traps for global monitoring, we assembled data from multiple local camera trap surveys to evaluate the interchange between fine- and broad-scale processes impacting mammalian carnivore communities.
   Location: Argentina, Belize, Botswana, Canada, Indonesia, Iran, Madagascar, Nepal, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and the U.S.A.
   Methods: We gathered camera trap data, totalling >100,000 trap nights, from across five continents. To analyse local and species-specific responses to anthropogenic and environmental variables, we fitted multispecies occurrence models to each study area. To analyse global-level responses, we then fitted a multispecies, multi-area occurrence model.
   Results: We recorded 4,805 detections of 96 mammalian carnivore species photographed across 1,714 camera stations located in 12 countries. At the global level, our models revealed that carnivore richness and occupancy within study areas was positively associated with prey availability. Occupancy within study areas also tended to increase with greater protection and greater distances to roads. The strength of these relationships, however, differed among countries.
   Main conclusions: We developed a research framework for leveraging global camera trap data to evaluate patterns of mammalian carnivore occurrence and richness across multiple spatial scales. Our research highlights the importance of intact prey populations and protected areas in conserving carnivore communities. Our research also highlights the potential of camera traps for monitoring wildlife communities and provides a case study for how this can be achieved on a global scale. We encourage greater integration and standardization among camera trap studies worldwide, which would help inform effective conservation planning for wildlife populations both locally and globally.

AB  - Tree cavities are microhabitats used by multiple taxa and are considered indicators of forest biodiversity. The factors that affect cavity occurrence and its dynamics are poorly known. We studied tree- and stand-level factors that affect cavity persistence in boreal forests. Cavities of Eurasian Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) (n = 654) were surveyed in a 170 km(2) area in southern Finland for 31 years during 1987-2017. In total, 447 cavities were lost during the study period: 329 to tree fall or breakage, 72 to cavity damage, and 46 to logging. With the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models, we analysed which tree- and stand-level factors affected the risk of a cavity to be damaged or lost due to tree fall. The median lifespan of cavities was 10 years, and both tree- and stand-level factors affected the persistence of cavities. Cavities in managed forest areas with low territory occupancy rates were more at risk of tree fall and cavity damage than in other types of forest areas. In all nest tree species, with the exception of European aspen (Populus tremula), the risk of cavity loss to tree fall declined with increasing tree diameter. Moreover, the risk of cavity loss to tree fall was higher in dead trees than in healthy and weakened trees. Cavities in deciduous tree species other than aspen were more at risk of damage than in other tree species. Furthermore, the risk of cavity damage was greater in cavities located lower in a tree. This study showed that factors like the tree species, and size and condition of a tree modify the persistence of woodpecker-made cavities. Consequently, it is likely that these factors influence the value of cavities as microhabitats and how these cavities can be used as indicators of forest biodiversity. Understanding the dynamics of cavities in forest habitats appears critical for the use of cavities as general biodiversity indicators.

AB  - Representative samples of the British and Norwegian population were surveyed by. telephone and asked to make a hypothetical choice between unlabeled wooden furniture and more expensive eco-labeled wooden furniture. Choice behavior was modeled as a random utility model with utility-theoretic restrictions on choice and estimated willingness to pay (WTP). To counteract upward biased hypothetical values, a followup question assessed the certainty of respondents' choices. For those not choosing the eco-labeled alternative, another followup question assessed if these individuals could be regarded as indifferent.
   Compared to the unlabeled wooden furniture with a price of US$332 in the UK and US$275 in Norway, the extra median WTP for the eco-labeled alternative was estimated to be US$5.16 (1.6%) in the UK and US$2.79 (1%) in Norway, with a censored log-logistic binary choice model. In these estimates only the "absolutely sure" were counted as valid choices of the eco-labeled alternative. The censoring implied that those who indicated indifference between unlabeled and eco-labeled furniture had their estimated WTP adjusted to 0. About 39% of the UK population and 32% of the Norwegian population are predicted to choose the eco-labeled alternative when the price difference is less than 5%.

AB  - Offshore wind (OSW) has the potential to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and halt damaging climate change. However, policies to foster an OSW industry in Norway have long been small and scarce. Recent events suggest that this is changing, as the state-owned enterprise Enova decided to grant a record NOK 2.3 bn to build the world's largest floating offshore wind farm in 2019, the Hywind Tampen project. Based on previous work by the corresponding author, we summarize the political development of OSW in Norway to distil generalisable lessons. The corresponding author employed interviews, document analysis and process tracing, using a theory of policy change to characterise the observed political change. She found that the main obstacle for early OSW deployment has been that environmental and visibility concerns have exacerbated energy-political ones that are created by a longstanding lack of local energy demands. As the green energy demand on a global scale is soaring, the lack of OSW deployment for exports implies that climate-political objectives have been subordinated to energy-political ones, in the formulation of Norwegian OSW policies. This hierarchy of goals was not deemed to have changed, despite the recent political developments in the policy area of Norwegian OSW. Hence, the Norwegian case demonstrates the role of context and national sectoral policies in deciding the pace of sustainable energy transitions. It is suggested that future research considers how policy best practices for renewable energy deployment could be adjusted across varying national contexts to overcome political hurdles to the sustainable transition.

AB  - Reliable population estimates are an important aspect of sustainable wildlife management and conservation but can be difficult to obtain for rare and elusive species. Here, we test a new census method based on pedigree reconstruction recently developed by Creel and Rosenblatt (2013). Using a panel of 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we genotyped fecal samples from two Swedish brown bear populations for pedigree reconstruction. Based on 433 genotypes from central Sweden (CS) and 265 from northern Sweden (NS), the population estimates (N = 630 for CS, N = 408 for NS) fell within the 95% CI of the official estimates. The precision and accuracy improved with increasing sampling intensity. Like genetic capture-mark-recapture methods, this method can be applied to data from a single sampling session. Pedigree reconstruction combined with noninvasive genetic sampling may thus augment population estimates, particularly for rare and elusive species for which sampling may be challenging.

AB  - Carbon neutrality has become central in policy discourse and cities' climate actions are crucial to achieve this goal. Consequently, many cities have already published ambitious climate neutrality target years and are preparing for transition to climate neutrality.
   This study presents findings from the first ever literature review on the carbon-neutral city concept, covering definition, assessment approaches, and barriers and drivers for transition to carbon neutrality. These findings are combined with interviews with Finnish cities aiming at carbon neutrality to explore gaps between research and practice.
   More clarity is needed on the definition of carbon-neutral city concept and especially on the role of offsetting the emissions (a specific feature compared to other urban climate concepts). The lack of consistency in city carbon accounting methods and emission scopes making cities' carbon neutrality goals incomparable, thus calling for harmonization and guidance on common assessment methods. In addition to research, climate networks play an important role in the transition to carbon neutrality. Cities have set ambitious goals and need support to develop action plans, assess actions, come up with creative and innovative ideas and increase collaboration with various stakeholders. Development of ways to support cities that have taken on ambitious carbon neutrality targets would benefit from more systematic research on transition to carbon neutrality from different contexts capturing the lessons learned. There is a need for methods that are flexible enough to accommodate adjustments to local conditions and needs, but also consider broader system transition.

AB  - Climate change presents an unprecedented public health challenge as it has a great impact on population health outcomes across the global population. The key to addressing these health challenges is adaptation carried out in cities through collaboration between institutions, including public health ones. Through semi-structured interviews (n = 16), this study investigated experiences and perceptions of what public health aspects are considered by urban and public health planners and researchers when planning climate change adaptation in the coastal cities of Soderhamn (Sweden), Porto (Portugal) and Navotas (the Philippines). Results of the thematic analysis indicated that participating stakeholders were aware of the main climate risks threatening their cities (rising water levels and flooding, extreme temperatures, and air pollution). In addition, the interviewees talked about collaboration with other sectors, including the public health sector, in implementing climate change adaptation plans. However, the inclusion of the public health sector as a partner in the process was identified in only two cities, Navotas and Porto. Furthermore, the study found that there were few aspects pertaining to public health (water and sanitation, prevention of heat-related and water-borne diseases, and prevention of the consequences associated with heat waves in vulnerable groups such as children and elderly persons) in the latest climate change adaptation plans posted on each city's website. Moreover, participants pointed to different difficulties: insufficient financial resources, limited intersectoral collaboration for climate change adaptation, and lack of involvement of the public health sector in the adaptation processes, especially in one of the cities in which climate change adaptation was solely the responsibility of the urban planners. Studies using larger samples of stakeholders in larger cities are needed to better understand why the public health sector is still almost absent in efforts to adapt to climate change.

AB  - BackgroundIn Sweden there are nearly one million soil-based on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs). OWTSs may contribute to eutrophication of surface waters, due to the discharge of phosphorus (P). Hence, in certain cases, a high P removal rate (up to 90%) of OWTSs is required by Swedish authorities. Since these requirements may have costly consequences to property owners, it is debated whether they are too strict. In this debate, it is often claimed that the soil retention of P occurring in the natural environments may be underestimated by authorities. Soil retention is the inhibition of the transport of P through the ground, due to different chemical, physical and biological processes occurring there. These processes make the P transport slower, which may reduce the unwanted impact on receiving water bodies. However, the efficiency of soil retention of P remains unclear. The objective of this systematic map was to collect, code, organise and elucidate the relevant evidence related to the topic, to be able to guide stakeholders through the evidence base, and to support future research synthesising, commissioning, and funding. The systematic map was carried out in response to needs declared by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management but the conclusions should be valid for a wider range of countries across boreo-temperate regions.MethodsSearches were made for peer-reviewed and grey literature using bibliographic databases, search engines, specialist websites, and stakeholder contacts. The references were screened for relevance according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. A detailed database of the relevant studies was compiled. Data and metadata that enable evaluation and discussion of the character and quality of the evidence base were extracted and coded. Special focus was placed on assessing if existing evidence could contribute to policy and practice decision making. Descriptive information about the evidence base was presented in tables and figures. An interactive evidence atlas and a choropleth were created, displaying the locations of all studies.Review findings234 articles out of 10,797 screened records fulfilled the eligibility criteria. These articles contain 256 studies, performed in the field or in the laboratory. Six different study types were identified, based on where the measurements were conducted. Most studies, including laboratory studies, lack replicates. Most field studies are observational case studies.ConclusionsIt is not possible to derive valid generic measures of the efficiency of soil retention of P occurring in the natural soil environment from available research. Neither does the evidence base allow for answering the question of the magnitude of the potential impact of OWTSs on the P concentration in recipients on a general basis, or under what conditions OWTSs generally have such an impact. A compilation of groundwater studies may provide examples of how far the P may reach in x years, but the number of groundwater studies is insufficient to draw any general conclusions, given the complexity and variability of the systems. Future research should strive for replicated study designs, more elaborate reporting, and the establishment of a reporting standard.

AB  - Although its numbers are steadily increasing, authorities, experts and environmentalists still consider the Scandinavian wolf population to be threatened due to poor pedigree and unlawful killings. An integrated predator policy stipulates that conflicts regarding carnivores must be minimized to assure them continued existence. The recovery of the Scandinavian wolf population has, however, been increasingly contested. While the view that Sweden should take actions to preserve and maintain a wolf population is widely supported by authorities, nature organizations and many members of the public, others disagree, emphasizing that local traditions, values and meanings are being jeopardized as a result of the recovery aims and practices of wolf management. The goal of the central state to work towards the recovery of wolves in Sweden is essentially not a conflict over wolves. Instead, the controversy illustrates how divergent perceptions of the local environment can be understood to constitute inconsistencies regarding how to understand the landscape, and most importantly, what the landscape conveys to people through providing a context for their relationships with 'nature' and with each other. It is in this setting that the recovery of endangered and protected predators unfolds. As will be demonstrated here, central state efforts to achieve an ecosystem that secures the survival of endangered wildlife creates a highly charged political context in which issues of cultural identity, local knowledge and expert science are indivisible.

AB  - This article explores the recent regionalisation of Swedish governance - both policy and structure - in order to explore some of the aspects of research on Europeanisation that scholars in the field have recently signalled as especially problematic. We pay particular attention to the role of political cleavages, conflict and contestation, and to the construction and use of policy discourses surrounding European integration as a means of affecting domestic political change. Using the concept of 'usages of Europe' from French political sociology, we trace the development of a network of actors which eventually succeeded in constructing EU membership as a tipping point in what had long been intractable domestic debates around regionalisation in Sweden, and argue that an understanding of the discursive uses of EU membership is vital if scholars are to appreciate how the EU can 'hit home' even in the absence of strong formal powers.

AB  - Major tree species arc declining in many temperate forests due to changing disturbance regimes, including invasive pests and pathogens. We examined the interaction of secondary succession and Dutch elm disease in the Swedish temperate forest reserve Dal by Soderskog, based on five tree surveys made between 1909 and 2011. The forest is characterized by the coexistence of four major European tree species: wych elm (Ulmm glabra), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), European beech (Fagus sylvotica) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). After protection of the forest in 1918, lack of disturbance mainly favoured elm, while the oak population declined due to mortality of old oaks and lack of regeneration. Dutch elm disease has caused high and continuous elm mortality since 1988. As a result, increased light availability at the forest floor favoured abundant regeneration of ash, beech, and lately also oak. The recent arrival of an invasive fungal pathogen causing ash dieback may once again change the course of succession. Open space emerging from loss of elm and ash in forest reserves may be used by reserve managers in favour oak regeneration and biodiversity of semi-open woodlands once lost during succession to closed forest. We conclude that winners and losers change places as an effect of invasive pathogens, resulting in unexpected successions and both losses, id gains in valuable ecological niches and habitat structures in temperate broadleaf forests,

AB  - The habitat requirements of 11 beetle species associated with tree hollows were studied by correlating their occupancy with characteristics of the oaks and the number of hollow oaks in each stand. The species richness was higher in trunks with a large girth and in tree hollows with entrances situated high up on the trunks and not directed upwards. Several species occurred with higher frequencies in larger stands, which suggests that these species are sensitive to habitat fragmentation. In some cases at least, the present species richness may reflect higher densities of hollow trees in the past. It is therefore suggested that, in order to preserve the rare fauna in old oaks, the stand size must be increased at many sites. In this study two species,Elater ferrugineus and Tenebrio opacus, were absent from almost all stands with < 10 hollow oaks, whereas the other species occurred at least to some extent also in smaller stands. Presence/absence data of E. ferrugineus, T. opacus and Osmoderma eremita may be used to evaluate to what extent the fauna in old trees is affected by habitat fragmentation today as well as in the past.

AB  - European governments are rapidly turning to biomass to comply with the EU's legislated renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030. To do so, EU member states will likely have to increase imports of biomass from timber rich regions, which will undoubtedly disrupt international wood product markets. In this study, a static global forest trade model of coniferous wood products is used to examine the effects of expanded demand for wood pellets in Europe to generate reliable electricity. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is used to calibrate the model to 2012 bilateral trade flows. To assess the impact of increased wood-pellet demand on global forest products, we consider a scenario where EU demand for wood pellets doubles. Model results suggest increases in the world prices of industrial roundwood (1%), particleboard ($34/m(3)), fibreboard ($30/m(3)), pulp ($65/t) and pellets (71% to 128%), while the prices of sawnwood and plywood & veneer are projected to fall by $12/m(3) and $4/m(3), respectively. The gains and losses are unevenly distributed between timber rich and timber poor regions; Russia, Canada and the U.S. experience large net welfare gains of $706 million, $544 million and $416 million, respectively, while Asia loses $1.8 billion. In the forest products sector, the gains outweigh losses with economic benefits increasing by some $4.9 billion, but this is a cost to the consumers of electricity and/or taxpayers in the regions implementing these renewable energy policies. The price of wood pellets is projected to rise between $107 and $154 per tonne. The findings highlight the need to account for the interconnections among softwood forest products globally.

AB  - A large-scale and long-term research and development project Forest management inspired by natural disturbance dynamics (DISTDYN) was initiated in Finland in 2009. The aim is to examine how variation in spatial and temporal scales of felling affects forest structure and biota. Harvesting methods applied in this project include selection, gap, partial and clear felling with variable retention. Rehabilitation is also applied as dead wood is intentionally increased while harvesting. The motivation of the project lies in the growing interest in using natural disturbances as an inspiration of forest-ecosystem management and in the recognition that mid-to small-scale disturbances are a characteristic feature of unmanaged Fennoscandian forests. The effects of felling methods are studied at the stand scale. However, a unique aspect of the project is the focus on landscape-scale impacts of different harvesting alternatives by comparing ca. 150-ha landscape units with varying harvesting regimes. Overall, the project aims at creating a long-lasting multidisciplinary research infrastructure. It also addresses core issues of forest-ecosystem management, including ecological, timber-production, economic and socio-cultural performances of alternative harvesting practices.

AB  - Increasing air temperatures reduce the duration of ice cover on lakes and rivers, threatening to alter their water quality, ecology, biodiversity, and physical, economical and recreational function. Using a unique in situ record of freeze and break-up dates, including records dating back to the beginning of the 18th century, we analyze changes in ice duration (i.e., first freeze to last break-up), freeze and break-up patterns across Sweden. Results indicate a significant trend in shorter ice duration (62 %), later freeze (36 %) and earlier break-up (58 %) dates from 1913-2014. In the latter 3 decades (1985-2014), the mean observed ice durations have decreased by about 11 d in northern (above 60 degrees N) and 28 d in southern Sweden relative to the earlier three decades. In the same period, the average freeze date occurred about 10 d later and break-up date about 17 d earlier in southern Sweden. The rate of change is roughly twice as large in southern Sweden as in the northern part. Sweden has experienced an increase in occurrence of years with an extremely short ice cover duration (i.e., less than 50 d), which occurred about 8 times more often in southern Sweden than previously observed. Our analysis indicates that even a 1 degrees C increase in air temperatures in southern (northern) Sweden results in a mean decrease of ice duration of 22.5 (+/- 7.6) d. Given that warming is expected to continue across Sweden during the 21st century, we expect increasingly significant impacts on ice cover duration and hence, ecology, water quality, transportation, and recreational activities in the region.

AB  - Aim. To describe the clinical aspects of implantable cardioverter defibrillators care in Sweden with focus on organisation, the role and education of nurses, patient information and education and areas in need of improvement.
   Background. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantations have developed rapidly in recent years and are now an established arrhythmia treatment. The expanding indication for implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation demands new competencies and resources in the implantable cardioverter defibrillators team members.
   Methods. Participants were recruited among physicians and nurses in all of the hospitals implanting implantable cardioverter defibrillators (n = 16). Data were collected by a questionnaire. Additionally, all written educational materials provided to patients pre- and postimplant were collected from all 16 hospitals. Deductive content analysis using Sarvimaki and Stenbock-Hult's five holistic dimensions was employed to ascertain how information was provided in brochures and information materials.
   Results. Half of the hospitals (n = 8) had nurse-based outpatient clinics and several others planned to introduce them. Three hospitals carried out distance follow-ups by means of tele-monitoring. The nurses had received specific implantable cardioverter defibrillators education from implantable cardioverter defibrillators companies and/or various university courses. The biophysical dimension dominated in the information material, while the emotional, intellectual and socio-cultural dimensions were scarcely described, and the spiritual-existential was not referred to at all.
   Conclusion. Holistic care of implantable cardioverter defibrillators patients can be achieved by means of a multidisciplinary implantable cardioverter defibrillators team and more patient-centred educational strategies. In Sweden, the organisation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators care and follow-up is developing towards more nurse-based clinics.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Development and implementation of structured care programmes with a more holistic approach can improve future implantable cardioverter defibrillators care. The content of the written educational materials need to be more holistic, rather than mainly focusing on the biophysical and technical aspects of living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

AB  - This study aims to identify and categorise the sustainability concerns raised in retail planning policy discourse, using empirical data from Finland. In order to identify the concerns, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of the policy discourse presented in media from 1990 to 2015. The analysis was conducted chronologically in order to understand the evolution of the sustainability concerns and the changes in the policy debate. To categorise the concerns identified from the discourse, we developed a holistic sustainability framework based on previous literature. Our findings show that during 1990's the concerns were mostly socio-economic, however, due to enforcement of sustainable development policies, the share of environmental concerns raised significantly in 2000s. The findings of our study reveal the problematics of the retail planning policy making and call for a more holistic understanding of the multidimensionality of the sustainability impacts of retail planning.

AB  - The magnitude and urgency of the biodiversity crisis is widely recognized within scientific and political organizations. However, a lack of integrated measures for biodiversity has greatly constrained the national and international response to the biodiversity crisis. Thus, integrated biodiversity indexes will greatly facilitate information transfer from science toward other areas of human society. The Nature Index framework samples scientific information on biodiversity from a variety of sources, synthesizes this information, and then transmits it in a simplified form to environmental managers, policymakers, and the public. The Nature Index optimizes information use by incorporating expert judgment, monitoring-based estimates, and model-based estimates. The index relies on a network of scientific experts, each of whom is responsible for one or more biodiversity indicators. The resulting set of indicators is supposed to represent the best available knowledge on the state of biodiversity and ecosystems in any given area. The value of each indicator is scaled relative to a reference state, i.e., a predicted value assessed by each expert for a hypothetical undisturbed or sustainably managed ecosystem. Scaled indicator values can be aggregated or disaggregated over different axes representing spatiotemporal dimensions or thematic groups. A range of scaling models can be applied to allow for different ways of interpreting the reference states, e.g., optimal situations or minimum sustainable levels. Statistical testing for differences in space or time can be implemented using Monte-Carlo simulations. This study presents the Nature Index framework and details its implementation in Norway. The results suggest that the framework is a functional, efficient, and pragmatic approach for gathering and synthesizing scientific knowledge on the state of biodiversity in any marine or terrestrial ecosystem and has general applicability worldwide.

AB  - Encroaching urbanisation changed Lidesjarvi from being a lake largely in a rural area surrounded by cultivated fields, pastures and meadows at the beginning of the 20th century to its present-day urban land setting. The lake has been damaged by pollution, road construction, dumping of toxic waste, introduced species and building of new settlements. To assess the impact of these temporal changes in the aquatic plant biodiversity of Iidesjarvi this study analysed macrophyte survey data collected during the course of the 20th century. The study indicated that despite of the environmental changes the total number of aquatic macrophytes remained relatively stable, but the species composition has changed considerably reflecting the changes in land use, water quality and the invasion of alien species. Some previously dominant species have disappeared with eutrophication affecting particularly elodeids and ceratophyllids. Some species have returned to the lake after a long absence. Similar lakes in the region form a dynamic system where the exchange of species from one to another may be possible. The semi-isolated lagoons may also help to re-establish aquatic macrophyte species in the main basin of lidesjarvi, if the water quality improves in the future.

AB  - Following decades of international collaboration to restore the Baltic Sea, we provide an assessment of the domestic implementation of measures agreed to limit diffuse agricultural pollution and the patterns of policy instruments applied. Despite the Helsinki Convention being unusually specific in detailing what measures countries should introduce, we find many shortcomings. These are most pronounced in the larger countries (Poland, Germany and Russia), while smaller countries perform better, notably Sweden and Estonia. The patterns of policy instruments applied differ, influenced by domestic politics. The limited use of complementary policy instruments suggests that other priorities overrule full and effective implementation, with engagement mirroring the advantages that a restored Baltic Sea can bring to countries. Using the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to support farmers in managing nutrients, particularly advisory services and investments in modern manure management technologies, represents a significant opportunity for reducing agricultural pollution in most countries.

AB  - Today, there is strong pressure for firms, in Norway and abroad, to adopt green or sustainable strategies. Furthermore, many Norwegian firms, directly or indirectly dependent on the dominating but declining petroleum sector, face a further challenge as they have to enter new industries in search of market opportunities. We address these dual challenges and study how green and new industry strategies are a function of firm- and regional-level characteristics. Multilevel analyses of Norwegian survey data show that both green and new industry strategies are pursued by knowledge-intensive firms that are innovative and having interfirm innovation collaboration. Green strategies are pursued by large firms and firms localized in sparsely populated regions, but they are avoided by independent firms and firms having carried out layoffs. New industry strategies are pursued by small firms, firms with growth in employees, and firms having carried out mergers or acquisitions and cost reductions.

AB  - Today several global forces are raising expectations that forestry must be practiced on a sustainable basis. This is true for forestry as practiced in tropical, temperate, and boreal regions, as well as in developed and developing countries. Several institutional processes are in place to develop criteria for and indicators of sustainable forestry. As customers and consumers have become more knowledgeable, they are becoming more demanding about the environmental attributes of the products they buy. Forest products companies and forest landowners who wish to maintain access to these more demanding markets will need to provide assurances of their commitment to sustainable forestry practices.
   Forest landowners and forest products manufacturers in Washington, Oregon, and California are currently better positioned to meet these expectations than are producers in other regions. In these western states, state forest practices laws and regulations are generally consistent with emerging international criteria and indicators of sustainable management.
   However, U.S. competitors in such countries as Canada and Sweden are acting rapidly to establish sustainable forestry practices, and to communicate their commitments to their stakeholders and customers. The assurance of sustainable forestry practices is now the latest means by which environmentally aware and demanding customers and consumers differentiate among forest products producers.

AB  - Local agri-environmental schemes, including hedgerows, flowering strips, organic management, and a landscape rich in semi-natural habitat patches, are assumed to enhance the presence of beneficial arthropods and their contribution to biological control in fruit crops. We studied the influence of local factors (orchard management and adjacent habitats) and of landscape composition on the abundance and community composition of predatory arthropods in apple orchards in three European countries. To elucidate how local and landscape factors influence natural enemy effectiveness in apple production systems, we calculated community energy use as a proxy for the communities' predation potential based on biomass and metabolic rates of predatory arthropods. Predator communities were assessed by standardised beating samples taken from apple trees in 86 orchards in Germany, Spain and Sweden. Orchard management included integrated production (IP; i.e. the reduced and targeted application of synthetic agrochemicals), and organic management practices in all three countries. Predator communities differed between management types and countries. Several groups, including beetles (Coleoptera), predatory bugs (Heteroptera), flies (Diptera) and spiders (Araneae) benefited from organic management depending on country. Woody habitat and IP supported harvestmen (Opiliones). In both IP and organic orchards we detected aversive influences of a high-quality surrounding landscape on some predator groups: for example, high covers of woody habitat reduced earwig abundances in German orchards but enhanced their abundance in Sweden, and high natural plant species richness tended to reduce predatory bug abundance in Sweden and IP orchards in Spain. We conclude that predatory arthropod communities and influences of local and landscape factors are strongly shaped by orchard management, and that the influence of management differs between countries. Our results indicate that organic management improves the living conditions for effective predator communities.

AB  - As one of the final activities of the ESF-CONGEN
   Networking programme, a conference entitled
   Integrating Population Genetics and Conservation
   Biology was held at Trondheim, Norway,
   from 23 to 26 May 2009. Conference speakers
   and poster presenters gave a display of the
   state-of-the-art developments in the field of conservation
   genetics. Over the five-year running
   period of the successful ESF-CONGEN Networking
   programme,much progress has been made in
   theoretical approaches, basic research on
   inbreeding depression and other genetic processes
   associated with habitat fragmentation
   and conservation issues, and with applying
   principles of conservation genetics in the
   conservation of many species. Future perspectives
   were also discussed in the conference, and
   it was concluded that conservation genetics is
   evolving into conservation genomics, while at
   the same time basic and applied research on
   threatened species and populations from a population
   genetic point of view continues to be
   emphasized.

AB  - The National Environmental Objectives (NEOs) adopted by Swedish Parliament in 2001 and proclaimining that major environmental problems should be solved within a generation are often portrayed as good practice of a concrete yet visionary sustainability strategy. In this paper we summarize one and a half decade of the NEOs' experience for the international audience. The NEO5 were based on an eclectic mixture of conceptual reasoning, most importantly the Management by Objectives concept and the notion of a policy deriving its authority and legitimacy from scientifically established 'natural laws and limits'. The 16 NEO5 fall into two groups. The first group is a positive reformulation of existing environmental problems based on well established scientific evidence. While they have scientific authority and can be operationalized and enforced through standards they are hardly visionary, strategic or capable of responding to emerging threats. The second group contains utopian landscape goals which are more visionary but also more difficult to operationalize, especially for local authorities which play major part in the implementation of the NEO5 in Sweden. We argue that the system that mixes these two sets of goals based on two different paradigms of sustainable development inherits the weaknesses of both and the strengths of neither. The NEO system lacks the hierarchical and scientific authority potentially possible for scientific goals and at the same time fails to provide for learning, mobilisation and consensus-building power of utopian landscape goals. It has been too fuzzy to be implemented in a top down way and yet too rigid to enable bottom-up action. A more effective approach would be to separate these two sustainability governance approaches into complementary but distinct systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - Renewable energy

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse and problematize the relations between international forestry companies and wood energy in the context of climate change in Chile and Sweden.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Based on interviews, field observations and analysis of documents, case studies of international forestry companies and wood energy in local areas of Chile and Sweden are examined comparatively. A conceptual framework combining political ecology and environmental communication is developed to approach the cases.
   Findings
   The paper finds that the two international forestry companies studied here have widely incorporated the use of wood energy as a renewable and carbon neutral energy strategy for their forestry business. Second, the paper finds that wood energy is used as a way to reproduce forestry development in the two countries, which is contested by NGOs and activists which are today articulating critical approaches to forestry development in the two countries. Third, related to the former finding, the paper finds that the incorporation of wood energy into the forest sector's interests in Chile and Sweden takes place in the context of important social-ecological conflicts related to industrial forestry development.
   Originality/value
   The paper's analytical framework helps to analyse the social-ecological nature of international business and the way they organise material practices and communicative meaning around renewable energy. The paper's findings and analysis shed light on important problematic aspects of the material and symbolic struggles around renewable energy in the context of climate change. The comparative dimension of the analysis has the value to offer a cross-border analysis to improve the understanding of some of the most important aspects of international businesses concerning wood energy today.

AB  - The changes in agricultural practices during the last century have led to a drastic decrease in the number of traditionally managed hay meadows. Also, traditional management practices are often applied more cursorily in the remaining meadows. In combination with an increase in aerial anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, this has led to a loss of biodiversity. To investigate whether the current management is sufficient for maintaining viable populations of a typical meadow plant, Succisa pratensis, we experimentally reinforced the raking and mowing parts of the traditional management over four years in a two-by-two factorial experiment in three traditionally managed wooded hay meadows on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. We found decreased litter and hay production in two of the three studied meadows as a result of our treatments. Plant sizes and asymptotic population growth rates (lambda) of S. pratensis increased, particularly in plots receiving the combined raking and mowing treatment. Stochastic long-term population growth rates (lambda (s) ) increased under the reinforced management: projected population sizes 50 years into the future showed a three-fold increase in raked plots and a 17-fold increase in plots that were both raked and mown. Because we found positive responses even in these seemingly well-managed meadows we conclude that it is essential that management is carried out more thoroughly to ensure viable population sizes. Our conclusion applies to most semi-natural grasslands receiving anthropogenic nitrogen, or where traditional management practices are less rigorously applied. We also suggest using biomass estimation instead of vegetation height as a measure of management strength.

AB  - Sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) forests have an important ecological function in the coastal zone, as they inhabit a high number and a specific composition of fauna. In 2002, a large-scale disappearance of sugar kelp was observed in Skagerrak and parts of the south-western coast of Norway, and the perennial sugar kelp forests were replaced by opportunistic and ephemeral filamentous algae. For management purposes, including identifying areas for restoration initiatives, maps of where sugar kelp forests are supposed to be found and where and under what conditions they have disappeared are needed. Based on modelled and field-measured geophysical variables and presence/absence/loss data of sugar kelp, we therefore developed spatial predictive probability models (i.e. maps) for sugar kelp potential distribution under natural conditions and areas of kelp loss. The influence of geophysical factors was analysed using generalized additive models (GAMs). Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we found that wave exposure, depth, light exposure and slope best explained the potential distribution of sugar kelp. Areas of sugar kelp disappearance were identified by the combined effect of wave and light exposure. These models were developed into maps presented to the managers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyses how a green transformation is conceptualized by practitioners in Norway's agriculture and fisheries sectors. Drawing upon a narrative analysis and qualitative interviews in four geographical regions, we examine how practitioners understand, negotiate and contest the green transformation. The paper identifies two main cross-sectoral narratives: 'Innovative technological solutions' and `Local sustainable resource use'. The two distinct but interrelated narratives demonstrate an inherent tension between ensuring profitability and shifting to more environmentally sound and climate friendly modes of production. The innovative technological solutions narrative draws extensively on large-scale application of technology and market arrangements, where the state is seen as provider of incentives for a new green economy. The local sustainable resource narrative rather emphasizes small-scale niche production and making use of available resources for the benefit of the economy, environment and local communities. Both narratives contest the green transformation at higher policy level when it is framed within singular focus on climate change and GHG emission cuts and instead argue for a definition that encompass broader environmental sustainability concerns. Practitioners within the fisheries and agricultural sectors promote their activities and products as sustainable and as an important part of a green transformation. By doing so, the narratives are not transformational but rather ensure a continuation of current practices with incremental adjustments that may contribute to environmental sustainability.

AB  - Recreational fishing as a tourist activity has become an increasingly important part of the Norwegian travel industry and may contribute significantly to the fishing mortality on Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua). Quantifying catches in the tourist fishery is made difficult by Norway's intricate and long coastline, and the lack of a fishing licence system, a registry of businesses catering for fishing tourists, and a registry of charter boats. A probability-based survey was used to estimate annual catch and effort by boat for anglers associated with 445 tourist-fishing businesses during 2009. From a stratified random sample of businesses, fishing tourists were recruited systematically over time to record their daily catch and effort in diaries. Cod dominated the reported landed catch (harvest) north of 62 degrees N, and saithe and mackerel dominated south of 62 degrees N. The estimated total landed catch of all species taken by tourist fishers in the business sector during 2009 was 3335 t (relative standard error, RSE = 17%), of which 1613 t (RSE = 22%) were cod. It is concluded that surveys based on self-sampling can yield accurate estimates of catch and effort accounted for by the business sector of the Norwegian tourist fishery and that the tourist catch of coastal cod is insignificant compared with the commercial and recreational catch by local residents.

AB  - This paper analyses how Finland's circular economy policy attends not only to the promotion and acceleration of innovation, but also the reconfiguration of resource intensive systems. Socio-technical transitions research has historically focused on niche innovation processes. Yet recently, increasing attention has been placed on policy processes that seek to destabilise and disrupt incumbent systems and practices. Furthermore, the social justice aspects of system phase out policies have been brought to the fore. Our qualitative analysis of Finland's circular economy policy programme draws upon the transformative innovation policy and sustainability transitions policy-mix literatures, extending the transformative outcome framework to include outcomes related to the repercussions of regime destabilisation, coordination and tilting the socio-technical landscape. Our analysis shows that Finland's circular economy policy programme aims predominantly at niche stimulation and acceleration, with little emphasis on the regime destabilisation or coordination. Overall, the policy proposals aim toward a strategy of progressive system change, an orientation shaped by the country's corporatist approach to policy making and pre-existing plans.

AB  - Apple genetic resources in Norway are currently conserved within a number of local clonal archives. However, during establishment of these ex situ collections, primary focus was not on capturing as much of the diversity as possible, but instead on preserving cultivars of particular importance to specific fruit-growing areas. To identify redundancies within the collection as well as to assess the genetic diversity and structure of apple germplasm currently being conserved in Norway, eight microsatellites were used in genetic characterization of 181 apple accessions. Overall, 14 cases of synonym or possibly mislabeled accessions were identified, as well as several homonyms and duplicates within and among the analyzed collections. The information obtained should contribute to overall better management of the preserved germplasm. Bayesian analysis of genetic structure revealed two major clusters, one containing most of the foreign cultivars, while the other consisted mainly of traditional Scandinavian cultivars, but also some very winter-hardy genotypes such as 'Charlamovsky', 'Gravenstein', 'Transparente Blanche', and 'Wealthy'. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected a significant genetic differentiation among the clusters (f(CT) = 0.077; P < 0.01). The results of the Bayesian analyses do not indicate a strong differentiation between the foreign and the Norwegian apple accessions, however, they do suggest that climate adaptation has had a significant influence on the genetic structure of the preserved germplasm. Overall, apple accessions currently maintained ex situ in Norway represent a diverse germplasm which could be very valuable in future breeding programs, especially for the Scandinavian climate.

AB  - A harmful algal bloom occurred in late spring 2019 across multiple, interconnected fjords and bays in northern Norway. The event was caused by the haptophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri and led to severe fish mortality at several salmon aquaculture facilities. This study reports on the spatial and temporal succession dynamics of the holistic marine microbiome associated with this bloom by relating all detectable 18S and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants to the relative abundance of the C. leadbeateri focal taxon. A k-medoid clustering enabled inferences on how the causative focal taxon cobloomed with diverse groups of bacteria and microeukaryotes. These coblooming patterns showed high temporal variability and were distinct between two geographically separated time series stations during the regional harmful algal bloom. The distinct blooming patterns observed with respect to each station were poorly connected to environmental conditions, suggesting that other factors, such as biological interactions, may be at least as important in shaping the dynamics of this type of harmful algal bloom. A deeper understanding of microbiome succession patterns during these rare but destructive events will help guide future efforts to forecast deviations from the natural bloom cycles of the northern Norwegian coastal marine ecosystems that are home to intensive aquaculture activities.IMPORTANCE The 2019 Chrysochromulina leadbeateri bloom in northern Norway had a major impact on the local economy and society through its devastating effect on the aquaculture industry. However, many fail to remember that C. leadbeateri is, in fact, a common member of the seasonal marine microbiome and the same spring phytoplankton blooms that support the marine ecosystem. It is challenging to draw any conclusions about exact causation behind the harmful bloom of 2019, especially since the natural bloom cycles of C. leadbeateri are not well understood. This study begins to fill major knowledge gaps that may lead to future forecasting abilities, by providing a molecular-based investigation of the destructive 2019 bloom that presents new insights into a seasonal marine microbial ecosystem during one of these sporadically reoccurring events.

AB  - Plastic, and its pollution of marine ecosystems, has emerged as a global concern. Among the several other sources, plastics from abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gears (ALDFG), and ropes are considered the most dangerous for marine wildlife. In EU states, the management ALDFG is prioritized through a dedicated action plan owing to the hazardous nature of ALDFG and the increase in commercial fishing activity in EU waters.The action plan demands to close the loop of plastics from fishing to ensure sustainable resource management using strategies of the circular economy (CE). Commercial fishing is a crucial sector in Norway, generating 4000 tons of waste plastic annually from fishing gears and ropes. While recycling, landfilling, and incineration are the standard end-of-life management options, the recycling industry in the region is immature. The lack of recycling capacity and inadequate infrastructure results in exporting most of the recyclable fraction out of Norway for further processing. Although within the framework of CE, the transboundary export of waste for recycling misses the opportunity to create value out of waste within the region. Therefore, in the pursuit of CE strategies, it is essential to ensure regional sustainability.
   In this study, we assess the environmental, economic, and social impacts of landfilling, incinerating, and recycling of waste fishing gears in Norway. To represent the current state, we include two existing recycling scenarios for the assessment, namely, recycling (inland) and recycling (export). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from relevant stakeholders, we adapted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to rank the end-of-life (EOL) alternatives through their ability to sustainably manage 4000 tons of waste plastics from fishing gears in Norway. The ranking and insights from stakeholder interaction were used to ascertain potential barriers in realizing principles of CE and to further recognize opportunities for establishing circular business models in the region.

TI  - The importance of northern dimension foreign policies in the geopolitics of the circumpolar north
T2  - GEOPOLITICS
LA  - English
AB  - The end of the Cold War dramatically altered geopolitical relationships within the circumpolar North. Part of this change involved the development of a regionalised governance structure stressing the common issues faced by human populations within the circumpolar North, regardless of their national or ethnic origins. Signatories to a cadre of new circumpolar agreements include eight nation- states or the "Arctic states" (Canada, USA, Russia, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland) as well as indigenous peoples organisations and supranational organisations such as the European Union.
   Equally important, although somewhat less tangible, is the fact that in addition to the new forms of international and regional governance now giving shape to an emerging circumpolar "northern" space, are several new discourses concerning the scale and nature of circumpolar regionalism and the critical new environmental, human security, and economic development challenges which it faces. Rather than using the rhetoric of tension and confrontation common throughout the Cold War era, these new northern discourses stress regional co-operation, human security and sustainable development.
   This paper examines the political structures and actors which give shape to emerging geopolitical versions of the international "North". It explores the relationship between the new international geopolitical space of this circumpolar region and the northern dimension policies of constituent states, in order to identify links between the geopolitical consensus which has become the potential basis for the international structure and goals of governance within the circumpolar region. Particular emphasis is placed upon Canada, the USA and the European Union, where northern dimension policies are most developed.

AB  - A participatory modelling process (DEMO) has been developed and applied in a 350 km(2) catchment in southern Sweden. The overall goal is to improve the dialogues between experts and local stakeholders by using numerical models as a platform for discussions. The study is focused on reducing nutrient load and on the development of a locally established measure plan, which is requested by the European Water Framework Directive. The HBV-NP model was chosen as it can calculate effects and costs for different allocations of several combined measures in a catchment. This paper shows the impact of including local data in the modelling process vs. using more general data. It was found that modelled diffuse nutrient pollution was highly modified when including local know-how, soft information and more detailed field investigations. Leaching from arable land was found to be 35% higher using more detailed information on for instance, agricultural practices, crop and soil distribution. Moreover, the stakeholders' acceptance of model results and reliance on experts was increased by applying the participatory process and involving stakeholders in the modelling procedure.

AB  - The Kokemaenjoki River Basin is the fourth largest in Finland. The city of Pori at the delta of the river is the most significant flood risk area in Finland. The preparation of a flood risk management plan (FRMP) for the Kokemaenjoki River Basin as a national pilot began in 2007 and will be finalised during 2011.
   The main challenges of the FRMP are the reconciliation of flood risks and various interests in different parts of the river basin, and adaptation to climate change. It has been predicted that climate change will alter the flood dynamics of the Kokemaenjoki River: the highest flow peaks will shift from spring to late autumn and winter and the risk of ice jam floods will increase.
   Development of the existing early warning systems and adaptive lake regulation practices are the two most important non-structural measures for preventing and mitigating flood damage. A new channel in the mid-river reach would help to manage the increasing winter flows. Also robust structural flood protection measures will be needed in the city of Pori. Nevertheless, close collaboration among authorities, municipalities and water body regulators will be critical in successful flood risk management in the Kokemaenjoki River Basin.

AB  - A methodology is presented for evaluating and mapping the degree of groundwater contamination by applying the contamination index C-d. The applicability of the contamination index was tested in two distinctly different geological regions: the area between Uusikaupunki and Ylane in southwestern Finland and the Brezno area in central Slovakia. The index takes into account both the number of parameters that exceed the upper permissible concentrations of contaminants or potentially harmful elements and the part of the concentrations exceeding those values. The water-quality parameters reflect the effect of diverse natural (topographical, climatical, geological, biological) and anthropogenic (type of land use, local pollution) environmental factors on groundwater quality. In Finland, technical-aesthetic contamination was found over more than half the test area. These quality problems were most often related to acidity and high concentrations of organic carbon and Al and Fe in wells. Health-risk-based contamination, mainly caused by elevated concentrations of fluoride, radon, or nitrate, was found in only a few separate areas. In Slovakia, naturally contaminated and anthropogenically polluted groundwaters could be distinguished. The geogenic pollution is mainly derived from sulfide mineralizations. In both countries the strongest anthropogenic pollution was found in intensively cultivated areas.

AB  - In this article, focusing on the ongoing implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, we analyze some of the opportunities and challenges for a sustainable governance of water resources from an ecosystem management perspective. In the face of uncertainty and change, the ecosystem approach as a holistic and integrated management framework is increasingly recognized. The ongoing implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) could be viewed as a reorganization phase in the process of change in institutional arrangements and ecosystems. In this case study from the Northern Baltic Sea River Basin District, Sweden, we focus in particular on data and information management from a multi-level governance perspective from the local stakeholder to the River Basin level. We apply a document analysis, hydrological mapping, and GIS models to analyze some of the institutional framework created for the implementation of the WFD. The study underlines the importance of institutional arrangements that can handle variability of local situations and trade-offs between solutions and priorities on different hierarchical levels.

AB  - Monitoring and managing Earth's forests in an informed manner is an important requirement for addressing challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change. While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-m resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic -aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.

AB  - BACKGROUND Moose (Alces alcesL.) populations and moose damage in forests are debated in Nordic countries with dense moose populations. Moose populations and food resources vary greatly, both spatially and temporally, and reliable data covering both variables simultaneously at the same scale have seldom been available. We modelled the effect of moose population density and forest resources on the area of moose damage at regional scale, referring to moose management areas (MMA). Forest data and moose damage data originated from the Finnish National Forest Inventory, and the moose population data came from a Bayesian moose model. For modelling, average values of moose population, damage and forest variables were calculated for the periods 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 for each MMA. The MMAs were further classified into one of four larger geographical zones. The area of moose damage was used as a dependent variable, and the proportions of different types of forests and moose population densities per land area or area of seedling stands as explanatory variables. The relationships were modelled with a linear mixed-effects model with an exponential spatial correlation structure. RESULTS The area of moose damage was best explained by total forest area, proportions of plantations and mature forests, and moose population density per land area or the proportion of plantations. There were differences among the biogeographical zones in how different variables explained the amount of damage. CONCLUSION The results provide tools for analyzing the regional effects of moose population density and the amount of food resources on the amount of moose damage. This information can be used in reconciling sustainable moose population levels and the amount of damage.

AB  - Although the production of the built environment is increasingly globalized, and architecture and urban planning (AUP) professionals are known to be the key carriers of mobile ideas, the internationalization of small owner-centred architectural offices has gained little academic attention, compared to the large consultancies that dominate the global market. We bring together the literature on the circuits of urban planning ideas, the international movement of AUP firms and professional ethoses to explore the internationalization of small AUP offices. Using interview data from Finnish offices, we investigate the 'what, where, why and how' and find that they have entered specific geographically delimited AUP circuits demarcated by type of project. We contribute to the literature by identifying motives characteristic of small offices guided by professional ethoses suited to the circuits where they internationalize. Their ethoses may evolve in time and space, as they operate in new circuits. We propose that ethos-circuit coherence may contribute to the successful internationalization of small architectural offices. The findings open avenues for further research on professional ethos not only of architects but also other internationally operating professionals, as it may guide their decisions by other than a narrowly conceived profit motive.

AB  - Vegetation can be used as a nature-based solution (NBS) to restore rivers and mitigate water-triggered processes along streambanks. Roots are well known to improve the overall stability of slopes through hydro-mechanical reinforcement within the rooted zone. Vegetation-based solutions require the selection of species that are most suitable for specific locations, and they are aimed at restoring the natural state and function of river systems in support of biodiversity, flood management, and landscape development. Selecting a combination of different species along different zones of the riverbank can improve the conditions for the river system with regard to biodiversity and stability. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate how the combination of a variety of different plant species can improve the stability of the riverbank. This paper presents a methodological approach for slope stability modeling including vegetation as well as the results obtained from a series of slope stability calculations adopting the proposed methodology. The analyses were carried out for critical shallow (<= 3 m deep) shear planes of ideal benchmark slopes covered with four different plant combinations-(i) only grass, (ii) grass and shrubs, (iii) only trees, and (iv) trees, shrubs, and grass-for species typically found along streams in southeastern Norway. In this desk study, two types of tree species were selected, namely Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens). The Goat willow (Salix caprea) was selected as a shrub, while a common mixed-grass was chosen as grass. Vegetation features were obtained from the literature. The methodology was used for two main cases: (1) considering only the mechanical contribution of vegetation and (2) considering both the hydrological and mechanical reinforcement of vegetation. The main outcome of the numerical modeling showed that the purely mechanical contribution of vegetation to slope stability could not be decoupled from the hydrological reinforcement in order to have a realistic assessment of the roots improvement to the stability. The most critical shear surfaces occurred below the rooted zone in all cases, and the best performance was obtained using the combinations including trees. Considering the typical climate conditions in Norway, the hydro-mechanical reinforcement was most effective in the spring and for combinations including low height vegetation (i.e., grass and shrubs). The study concludes that a mixed combination of vegetation (trees, shrubs, and grass) is the most suitable for reaching the highest hydro-mechanical reinforcement of streambanks, together with erosion protection and boosting the ecosystem biodiversity. The current study can help practitioners determine which vegetation cover combination is appropriate for improving the current stability of a streambank with restoration practices.

AB  - Forest management and the stand age play key roles in determining the composition of soil biota, including nematodes. We analysed the effect of the interaction between stands of natural forest and stands influenced by human activity on nematode communities, necessary for realistically assessing the specific potentials of forest soils, plant protection, forest management, and land use management. Nematode communities were evaluated and compared in managed beech and spruce forests in three age classes (0-20, 40-60, and 100-120 years old) and an unmanaged old-growth temperate forest. A total of 51 nematode genera were found in the forests. The number of nematode genera was the highest (46) in European beech forests, dominated by Rhabditis and Filenchus. In contrast, the number of nematode genera was the lowest (37) in a Norway spruce forest, but where nematode abundance was the highest due mostly to the high abundance of bacterivorous nematodes such as Acrobeloides, Plectus, and Rhabditis. The unmanaged old-growth forest had the lowest nematode abundance and total biomass but the highest abundance of herbivorous nematodes of the order Tylenchida, especially Filenchus, Malenchus, and Paratylenchus, and a high abundance of identified genera of predators. The number of identified nematode genera, abundance, total biomass, and diversity index were the highest in young 0-20-year-old stands, and the lowest in 100-120-year-old stands. Enrichment, structure, and basal indices were influenced by both the stands and the ages of the forests.

AB  - Tilia species are important constituents of natural broadleaved, deciduous forests of Europe, but have vanished from many forest during the past millennium. In this chapter, a survey of Tilia in Danish forest is presented and compared with forest management, age and structure. Tilia cordata and T. platyphyllos are mostly found in natural, ancient forests, and appear to be convenient indicators of forest management and forest age. Most populations are very small, but a few remarkable stands of both species with thousands of individuals are still surviving. The results point to the urgent need for installing active conservation and management measures, together with monitoring, in order to stabilize the most threatened populations of endangered woody species in Danish forests in general, and of Tilia species in particular.

AB  - Although academics and policymakers around the world recognise the disruptive power of the innovation, the research on innovation in tourism destinations is fragmented and manifests grey areas. The technology-driven approach in innovation prevails, neglecting the nature of the destination, as a complex system of relationships among diverse public and private actors, generating innovation based on knowledge sharing and dissemination. This paper contributes to the debate on innovation in destination proposing an integrative theoretical framework, which interprets the co-evolutionary processes of innovation in the knowledge-based destination. It considers two diverse processes of innovation in destination: the technology-driven innovation and the social-driven innovation. An exploratory multiple-case study was used to investigate an Italian and Finnish destination, in which actors have invested in social capital and information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructures, stimulating a co-evolutionary sequential process of pervasive innovation. The discussion and the conclusion suggest future research and challenges for academics, policymakers, and destination managers.

AB  - Fish stocks represent fundamental units in fisheries management, and their identification, especially in mixedfisheries, represents one of the primary challenges to sustainable harvest. Here, we describe the first "real-time" genetic management program used to manage a mixed-stock fishery of a non-salmonid and commercially significant marine fish, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L). Based upon the analysis of > 18 000 fish sampled from the commercial catch in Lofoten (Norway), which represents the largest remaining cod fishery in the Atlantic, we estimated the fraction of North East Arctic cod (NEAC), and Norwegian Coastal cod (NCC), just 24 h postlanding. These estimates, based upon the analysis of the Pantophysin gene, were performed weekly in the winter and spring of each year in the period 2007-2017. The program has successfully permitted the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries to actively manage the commercial exploitation of the highly abundant NEAC stock, while simultaneously limiting exploitation of the fragile NCC stock, both of which overlap at the spawning grounds. Data from this program have also revealed a distinct temporal increase in the fraction of NEAC on the spawning grounds in this region, which is consistent with the overall increased abundance of this stock as estimated by ICES.

AB  - Herbivores have important impacts on ecological and ecosystem dynamics. Population density and species composition are both important determinants of these impacts. Large herbivore communities are shifting in many parts of the world driven by changes in livestock management and exploitation of wild populations. In this study, we analyse changes in large herbivore community structure over 66 years in Norway, with a focus on the contribution of wildlife and livestock. We calculate metabolic biomass of all large-herbivore species across the whole region between 1949 and 2015. Temporal and spatial patterns in herbivore community change are investigated and we test hypotheses that changes in wildlife biomass are driven by competition with livestock. We find that total herbivore biomass decreased from 1949 to a minimum in 1969 due to decreases in livestock biomass. Increasing wild herbivore populations lead to an increase in total herbivore biomass by 2009. Herbivore communities have thus reverted from a livestock dominated state in 1949 (2% of large herbivore metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species) to a state with roughly equal wildlife and livestock (48% of metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species). Declines in livestock biomass were a modest predictor of wildlife increases, suggesting that competition with livestock has not been a major limiting factor of wild herbivore populations over the past decades. Instead there was strong geographic variation in herbivore community change, with milder lowland regions becoming more dominated by wild species, but colder mountain and northern regions remaining dominated by livestock. Our findings indicate that there has been notable rewilding of herbivore communities and herbivore-ecosystem interactions in Norway, particularly in milder lowland regions. However, Norwegian herbivores remain mostly regulated by management, and our findings call for integrated management of wild and domestic herbivores.

AB  - Migration studies have predominantly investigated the socio-cultural incorporation of low-skilled migrants and refugees, fuelled by concerns that these migrants may pose a burden on the state and a threat to social cohesion. Few studies have investigated the socio-cultural incorporation of skilled migrants, perhaps assuming that they will fare well in a country of destination. Using the petroleum industry in Norway as a case study, this article examines the workplace as a key site of transmission of norms and values of the host society. We investigate firm initiatives for the socio-cultural incorporation of skilled migrants and analyse the challenges that these workers experience in the workplace. We then discuss the roles of non-state actors in the incorporation process and offer suggestions that may enhance the socio-cultural incorporation of skilled migrants into the host society.

AB  - In the present contribution we report, for the first time, records of the nudibranch Zelentia ninel from Norway. The species is previously known only from the Barents Sea coast in northern Russia where it was described for the first time in 2017. Records of Z. ninel from six different localities in northern Norway from 2019-2023 are presented and discussed. The identity of the specimens was determined by investigation of external and internal morphology as well as molecular analysis of preserved specimens. Photographs of live specimens and radulae of preserved specimens are presented, and species delimitation is confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis. In order to assess the biogeographic distribution of Z. ninel based on all available information, recent unanticipated genetic data supporting a putative occurrence of Z. ninel at the Aleutian Islands, Alaska is also discussed where we provide arguments in support of occasional anthropogenic transportation outside its natural range. The present records significantly expand the known natural range of distribution for Z. ninel and demonstrate that the species is not restricted to the Russian Barents Sea coast but that the range encompasses also at least northern Norway. These data can provide important insights to the understanding of natural ranges of marine invertebrates across biogeographical regions affected by rapid ongoing climatic change.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to analyse whether immigrant women request induced abortion more frequently than Swedish-born women and, if so, to study possible explanations, including contraceptive practices and attitudes. Methods: All women who requested induced abortion during a period of one year were included in the study. The 1,289 women, of whom 36% were born outside Sweden, were interviewed by a nurse-midwife who, using a structured protocol, gathered information on socioeconomic factors, reasons for abortion, experience of contraceptive methods, and family planning counselling. The proportion of women with non-Swedish origin in the study population was compared with the official demographic statistics of the corresponding area. Results: The number of women born outside Sweden who requested induced abortion was larger than expected from their proportion in the population. The immigrant women originated from 77 countries and four continents, the largest subgroup, 11%, coming from Iran. Immigrant women had less experience of contraceptive use, more previous pregnancies and more induced abortions than women born in Sweden. In a multivariate analysis, immigrant status and educational level were found to be independent risk factors for repeat abortion. Conclusion: Immigrant status seems to be an independent risk factor for induced abortion. The immigrant women originated from a wide range of cultures. There is no reason to believe that the women in this heterogeneous group should have any cultural factor in common that could explain their higher proneness to seek induced abortion. The most probable cause is that immigrant status is associated more often with low education, weak social network, poverty, unemployment, and being outside common pathways to healthcare.

AB  - Marine plastic pollution is a growing stressor affecting both marine and terrestrial life. Plastic polymers are widespread in oceans, including sparsely populated Nordic countries. Norway, a fishing-dominant region, faces substantial plastic pollution from fishing ropes, which often end up incinerated, landfilled, or lost in the ocean, contributing to the ghost fishing problem. This research employs a static material flow analysis (MFA) to assess plastic mass flows and the recyclability of 15 rope types used in Norway's commercial fishing sector. Findings reveal that approximately 383 tons of ropes are lost annually in Norwegian waters, endangering fish species. Furthermore, only one-third of the rope types can be efficiently recycled using available recycling technologies, highlighting the need for circularity. The MFA and inventory-based ranking approach shows significant potential as a holistic decision support tool for industry and policymakers in exercising sustainable and circular management for ropes.

AB  - Natural swamp forests are extremely rare in Sweden because of extensive drainage and logging activities. This study reports a total of 517 species (148 vascular plants, 131 mosses, 64 hepatics, 142 lichens and 32 wood-inhabiting fungi) from 10 small remnants of boreal old-growth swamp forests. The 195 bryophytes found represent 33% of the total number of bryophyte species in the Swedish boreal flora. As the average area of the forests was only 2 ha, this figure clearly illustrates the important role of the swamp forests as centres of bryophyte biodiversity.
   There was no relationship between the occurrence of 33 lichen and fungi species considered to indicate natural forests with long stand continuity and the known long-term continuity of the forests. The forests most affected by earlier natural and man-made fires harboured more of these species than forests less affected by fire disturbance. The most important variable explaining biodiversity as well as presence of 'continuity indicator species' was the amount of dead wood present. A more critical and careful use of the concept of forest continuity is needed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Human impact on long-term vegetation and biodiversity changes is often discussed on a general level, connecting palynological data to archaeological time periods. In the present paper we present environmental change during the last 2,400 years on a coastal peninsula in Norway using pollen data from three sites: one lake and two bogs, in addition to 621 radiocarbon dates and in-context pollen samples from archaeological sites. Locally, a close relationship between palynological richness reflecting high landscape, habitat and floristic diversity, and the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates was found. During the settlement period 400 BCE-550 CE, concordant with maximum number of dates from archaeological contexts, a mosaic landscape containing infields and outfields developed. Cereals were cultivated and animals were grazing in heathlands that could provide both summer grazing and winter fodder. Additionally, seashores and wetlands were used for grazing. Settlement recession from 350 CE and abandonment following the 536 CE climate event, resulted in vegetation successions toward reforestation, abandonment of arable fields, and marshes turning into ombrotrophic peat. At the same time the distance to the sea, and to species rich shoreline meadows, continued to increase due to continuous postglacial land uplift in a flat landscape. A new increase in the summed probability distribution 900-1250 CE, is reflected in expansion of outfield pastures, heathlands in particular, a management that continued up into modern time. The local development is supported by the results on a regional scale, indicating overall climatic and social causes for observed vegetation changes. Both palynological richness and pollen-based landcover reconstructions indicate reforestation and less habitat diversity in the sixth century. On a regional scale, reforestation in the fifteenth century following the late medieval crises, is more pronounced than on the local scale, although both reflect exploitation of outfield resources.

AB  - We studied the utility of riparian corridors in boreal forest landscapes as habitats and dispersal routes for forest-associated noctuid and geometrid moths in northern Finland. We collected moths with baited traps to investigate their occurrence and abundance in four habitat types-forest interior, forest edge, forested corridors, and clearcuts-along riparian zones. This was done with a sampling design in which the four habitat types were nested within four riparian systems. Corridors were strips of forest 30-70 m wide surrounded by clearcuts and sapling stands. Trap sites in forest interior were more than 100 m away from the nearest forest edge within large (>50 ha) patches of mature (timber volume > 100 m (3) /ha ), spruce-dominated forests. Forest - edge trap sites were in the same forest patches within 25 m from the nearest clearcut edge, and clearcut trap sites were in recent (<10-year-old) clearcuts >50 m away from the nearest mature forest. A total of 6485 specimens, representing 57 moth species, were captured during the 6-week trapping period in late June-August 1999. The number of species and total number of individuals did not differ among the forested habitats (interior, edge, corridor) but were significantly lower in clearcuts. A consistent pattern across the nine species we examined in more detail was the low number of individuals captured in clearcuts. In general their abundance in corridors was equal to that observed in forest interiors and edges. Two species tended to occur in corridors in higher numbers than in forest-interior habitats. Our results suggest that corridors in boreal forest landscapes serve as breeding habitats or dispersal routes for the moths and may direct the movements of these forest-associated species. Results from studies showing positive effects of corridors on dispersal or population persistence should not, however, be used to justify more habitat destruction.

AB  - The aim of this case study was to estimate the impact of future adaptation to climate change with respect to frost on emissions from road construction. Based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) published by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services has predicted statistical frost quantities for the years 2071-2100 in Norway. Carbon emissions in production, loading, transportation, and construction related to the frost protection of roads were estimated based on the predictions and compared with frost protection based on frost quantities for the years 1981-2010. The case study covered two recently constructed four-lane highways in Norway that represent areas with minor and major frost quantities. Three alternative power sources for machinery and transportation were studied: fossil fuel, biofuel, and electricity. These alternatives were combined with two scenarios for climate change (RCPs): one intermediate (RCP4.5) and one business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Based on the combined alternatives and RCPs, the estimated reduction in CO2-equivalents ranged from 22% to 90%.

AB  - In the light of increasing urban challenges, municipalities are developing and advancing new forms of governing. One such example is ?urban experimentation?, a process where city-based innovation processes are initiated to test solutions that ? if deemed successful ? are intended to be scaled up with the ambition to leverage a broader urban sustainability transition. Research on experimental governance has shown that municipalities can play various roles in these processes, including the role as enabler. The article contributes to the literature on the roles of public actors in urban experimentation on sustainability challenges by advancing understanding of the less studied ?enabler? role. We probe the politics of enabling by focusing on the policy instruments employed by municipalities. Our aim is to provide deeper insights into the everyday work of urban administrations when they act in the ?enabler? role. One particular approach of urban experimentation is Urban Living Labs (ULL), and this paper analyses ULL that address sustainability challenges. Along the four dimensions of nodality, authority, treasury, and organisation, we identify the politics of enabling in four ULL examples from Sweden and the Netherlands.

AB  - The building and transportation sectors are responsible for the greatest proportion of energy consumption in cities. While they are intrinsically interlinked with urban built form and density, climate change and technological innovation are having an effect on their relative contributions. This paper aims to develop an optimisation framework to facilitate the identification of the most energy-efficient urban built forms and urban geometry for the future built environment that can be adapted to the changing climate and ongoing technological development. It examines future scenarios for the city of London as a temperate climate zone (as a case study), in 2050, and contrasts it with the present situation. Specifically, the impact of climate change along with the penetration of electric vehicles into the transportation system that can be charged via rooftop photovoltaics is investigated. This study initially develops the geometrical models of four selected urban built forms and, secondly, analyzes their energy performance using an urban energy simulation software. The results, showing the impact of future scenarios on building energy performance, urban built form and density, demonstrate that court and tunnel-court built forms show better energy performance for future development. It is therefore recommended that for future urban developments in London, deep plan court and tunnel-court buildings with a lower number of storeys and a large cut-off angle are more advantageous in terms of building energy to accommodate the expected climate change. Finally, results of simulation trials indicate that the total building energy demand in 2050 is considerably higher than in the present climate as a result of additional cooling load and electric vehicle charging load.

AB  - Background: Patients travel worldwide for paid kidney transplants. Although transplantations abroad are not always illegal, they are commonly perceived to be illegal and unethical involving risks. Aim: We aimed to describe the motivations and experiences of patients who traveled abroad for paid kidney transplantations and to examine how these transplantations were facilitated. Methods: We interviewed 22 patients who traveled from Macedonia/ Kosovo, the Netherlands, and Sweden for paid kidney transplantations between years 2000 and 2009. Results: Patients traveled because of inadequate transplant activity in their domestic countries and dialysis-related complaints. However, 6 patients underwent preemptive transplantations. Cultural factors such as patients' affinity with destination countries, feelings of being discriminated against by the health-care system, and family ties also help explain why patients travel abroad. Seven of the 22 patients went to their country of origin. They were able to organize their transplantations by arranging help from family and friends abroad who provided contacts of caregivers there and who helped cover the costs of their transplants. The costs varied from (sic) 5000 to (sic) 45 000 (US$6800-US$61 200). Seven patients paid the hospital, 5 paid their doctor, 4 paid a broker, and 6 paid their donors. Conclusion: Research should include interviews with brokers, transplant professionals, and other facilitators to achieve a full picture of illegally performed transplantations.

AB  - The long-term sustainability of fish stocks is dependent upon the identification of biologically meaningful demographic boundaries and, subsequently, appropriate assessment figures and management strategies. In the case of the horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus, stock management in the North-east Atlantic area is currently based on stock identities derived from multidisciplinary data integration, but including genetic markers that might lack statistical power, hence potentially misrepresenting the units of assessment. For this reason, and based on multiannual field observations, the boundaries of the vast 'western stock', whose distribution spans from the Bay of Biscay to the Norwegian coast, were reassessed. The preliminary results of a population genetics survey of samples collected over three consecutive years off the western Irish coast (areas VI and VII) and Norway (IVa), and screened by employing a suite of thirteen microsatellite loci are presented. Results indicate that the core of the putative stock in the west of Ireland is temporally stable, but its spatial extent and connection with Norwegian waters varies between years. Interannual variation in nutrient transport and oceanographic regimes may explain unstable patterns of genetic variation west of Norway, where local, smaller, previously unknown populations might exist.

AB  - This paper offers new insight to the effects of long distance express coach deregulation in Norway, which formally happened gradually between 1998 and 2003. We study data over a period that spans from the years prior to deregulation and up to 2010. We document the degree of both competition and cooperation in the market, which has taken a particular form in Norway due to historical requirements on coach operations. We also document that the market has changed character as a consequence of inter modal competition, in particular with air traffic. Our paper documents the successful development of an often neglected public transport mode, which has the potential to make long distance passenger transport more efficient more sustainable, and with hardly any subsidy requirements.

AB  - Fossil pollen and plant macrofossils over the last 2000 years are documented from three small forest hollows in Southern Sweden. One of the sites is inside a 5 ha highly prized old growth mixed Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies forest of high biodiversity which has been protected since 1940. The other two hollows are located 400 and 700 m away in an outlying buffer zone established in 1995 which is mainly coniferous plantation forest. The results show that the area has been forested for at least 2000 years, but that forest composition has been under continuous change, most rapid over the last 200 years. The reduction of deciduous tree pollen particularly Quercus, Tilia, Alnus and Corylus, and the immigration of Fagus and Picea can be observed at all three sites. However, the temperate deciduous trees (Quercus or Fagus) have been much more common in the 'hotspot' than in the surrounding forests over the last c. 200 years, and significantly more common at least 2000 years before that. Even though the vegetation has been dynamic through time, the lower human intervention in the 'hotspot' area compared with the surrounding matrix forests has facilitated the longevity of deciduous trees and the many rare species which are associated with them. The palaeoecological record of key species and information on past use of the wider forest area revealed in this study, indicates how future management will require flexibility to maintain conservation 'hotspots'.

AB  - Since 1988, Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt has been performed outdoors in the summer at Gala in Gudbrandsdalen in Norway. Peer Gynt is particularly connected to Norwegian national culture and identity, and this connection becomes particularly poignant at Gala. The event focuses on giving the audience a celebratory national-romantic experience of the typical Norwegian landscape, traditional Norwegian culture, and Peer Gynt, the most Norwegian of all plays. The question is whether a production here necessarily has to be subjected to the celebratory atmosphere of the event or whether it is possible for a production in these circumstances to question the hegemonic, national-romantic ideology that pervades the event. This article uses Chantal Mouffe's concept of 'critical art' and Louis Althusser's reflections on the relationship between theatre and ideology to discuss this question in respect of how the productions at Gala are marketed. The article argues that, whatever critical potential there is in performing Peer Gynt at Gala, it can be found by directly staging and questioning the expectations that the event creates and that audience members bring with them. Sigrid Strom Reibo employed such a strategy in her 2017 production, which is the focus of attention here. Lars Harald Maagero is a scholar and director whose research is concerned with the political and cultural impact of contemporary theatre. His productions include A Midsummer Night's Dream and Twelfth Night with Thesbiteatret in Norway, and Mozart's Don Giovanni at Opera Ostfold.

AB  - Large-scale forest scenario models are intensively used to make projections of forest areas of up to hundreds of millions of hectares. Within Europe, such projections have been done for 11 countries at the individual national scale, most often to foresee the long-term implications of the ongoing forest management. However, the validity of the models has rarely been tested.
   The aim of this study was 1. to validate the European Forest Information SCENario model (EFISCEN) by running it on historic Finnish forest inventory data, 2. to improve the model based on the validation, and 3. to project the Finnish forest development till 2050 with the improved model under alternative scenarios.
   The results of the validation showed that EFISCEN is capable of making reliable large-scale projections of forest resources for periods up to 50-60 years. Based on the validation, the model was improved concerning simulation of age development, thinning regimes and regrowth after thinning. The projection of the Finnish forests till 2050 with the improved model presented a maximum sustainable felling level of around 70 million m(3) per year. That provides an average growing stock of 106 m(3) ha(-1) in 2050 and a net annual increment. of 3.6 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1). If the current trend towards more nature oriented forest management continues and 1.39 million ha of forests have been set aside additionally for nature reserves by 2050, the felling level could meet a realistic demand of 57 million m(3) per year in 2050. Under the latter regime the average growing stock will have grown to 160 m(3) ha(-1) in 2050.

AB  - Viral disease poses a major barrier to sustainable aquaculture, with outbreaks causing large economic losses and growing concerns for fish welfare. Genomic epidemiology can support disease control by providing rapid inferences on viral evolution and disease transmission. In this study, genomic epidemiology was used to investigate salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causative agent of pancreas disease (PD) in Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to reconstruct SAV subtype-2 (SAV2) diversity and transmission dynamics in recent Norwegian aquaculture, including the origin of SAV2 in regions where this subtype is not tolerated under current legislation. Using nanopore sequencing, we captured ~90% of the SAV2 genome for n = 68 field isolates from 10 aquaculture production regions sampled between 2018 and 2020. Using time-calibrated phylogenetics, we infer that, following its introduction to Norway around 2010, SAV2 split into two clades (SAV2a and 2b) around 2013. While co-present at the same sites near the boundary of More og Romsdal and Trondelag, SAV2a and 2b were generally detected in non-overlapping locations at more Southern and Northern latitudes, respectively. We provide evidence for recent SAV2 transmission over large distances, revealing a strong connection between More og Romsdal and SAV2 detected in 2019/20 in Rogaland. We also demonstrate separate introductions of SAV2a and 2b outside the SAV2 zone in Sognefjorden (Vestland), connected to samples from More og Romsdal and Trondelag, respectively, and a likely 100 km Northward transmission of SAV2b within Trondelag. Finally, we recovered genomes of SAV2a and SAV3 co-infecting single fish in Rogaland, involving novel SAV3 lineages that diverged from previously characterized strains >25 years ago. Overall, this study demonstrates useful applications of genomic epidemiology for tracking viral disease spread in aquaculture.

AB  - In this paper, we develop an interdisciplinary agent-based framework for studying the provision of forest ecosystem goods and services (ES) at the landscape level. It combines forest owner types and their behavioral models with forest decision support systems (DSS). For this, we draw on mainstream decision-making theories in social sciences and relevant empirical evidence from Europe and beyond to suggest how economic, sociological and psychological rationalities can be combined to build a typology and behavioral models of forest owner decision-making including responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic changes. We then discuss how the theory-driven and evidence-based behavioral models in combination with forest owner and forest management insights can be used to analyze forest management behavior and responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic developments. By comparing standard forest DSS modeling results to exemplary results using the agent-based framework in terms of long-term simulations of timber production and biodiversity conservation in a case study in Sweden, we illustrate how the framework accounts for more differentiated and more realistic forest management practices at the forest landscape level. We discuss how the agent-based framework also helps explore and explain the impacts of future policy and socioeconomic changes on the provision of forest ES. We then suggest directions for future research that can further develop the framework and its use in forest modeling and DSS to better analyze the impact of future developments on forest management and the provision of forest ES at the landscape level.

AB  - A number of measures can be taken to make forestry more compatible with environmental requirements. However; the measures differ from each other with regard to both effects on the environment and effects on the economy of forestry. This paper reports a study focused on the cost efficiency of various environmental consideration measures taken in final logging, i.e. when the rotation period of the timber production is ended. It was found that of 19 measures studied, 4 have a negative effect, 12 have no significant effect and 3 have positive effect on the net revenue of final logging. Furthermore, it was found that the measures having no significant, or a positive, effect on the net revenue of final logging do in general affect the recreation environment and the biodiversity about as positively as do the measures having a negative effect on the net revenue of final logging. A large part of the environmental consideration in final logging is thus very cost efficient, but at the same time the results indicate that the cost efficiency could be increased further.

AB  - 1. Human-wildlife interactions occur when humans and wildlife overlap in the same landscapes. Due to the growing human population, the number of interactions will continue to increase, and in some cases, develop further into social conflicts. Conflicts may occur between people disagreeing about wildlife conservation or arguing over which wildlife management measures should be taken. Social conflicts between humans are based on different attitudes, values and land-use aspirations. The success of solving these social conflicts strongly depends on building trust between the public, stakeholders, authorities and researchers, as trust is fundamental to all communication and dialogue.
   2. Here we have examined how trust in large carnivore research differs within a geographically stratified sample of the Norwegian population. The comprehensive survey, including 2,110 respondents, allows us to explore how people perceive factual statements about large carnivores depending on the source of these statements. Specifically, the respondents were given multiple statements and asked to judge them in terms of meaning and authenticity depending on whether the statements were made by a politician, the Norwegian farmers' association, the Norwegian Fish and Game association or a large carnivore researcher. Based on the variations in perceptions, we inferred that trust in large carnivore researchers and their research results varied with people's attitudes, values and direct experience of large carnivores.
   3. In general, respondents perceived 60% of the statements to be genuine when given no information of who had made them. Although this increased to 75% when informed that the statements were made by a large carnivore researcher, there was still a 25% probability that the statement was perceived as manipulative or political. Age, environmental values and negative experiences of carnivores increased the probability of perceiving research statements as manipulative or political. People living in areas with high proportions of hunters showed particularly polarized views, either more strongly perceiving the statements as political, or in contrast as research.
   4. This study provides a novel perspective in understanding the role trust plays in social conflicts related to human-wildlife interactions.

AB  - Wind power development, whilst welcomed by many as a potentially green source of energy, also gives rise to considerable local resistance. Drawing on three case studies from coastal Norway (Froya, Haramsoy, and Egersund), the present article sets out to reflect on life in anticipation of wind power development. Reflecting on the nature of life in anticipation of undesired wind power developments, with implications for how life is lived in dread of imminent adversities in general (such as climate change, pandemics, and disaster risks), these case studies focus on how communities relate to the future and how they perceive and strive to organise so as to shape outcomes. A central point raised in this article is that wind power projects could become more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable if greater attention is paid to working with communities to reduce distrust and uncertainties before, during and after such projects. Hence, relational work carried out that may shape the affective state of anticipation prior to and during wind farm construction can be understood as crucial to the sustainability of large-scale green infrastructure projects.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is one of the world's most intensive centres for maritime traffic. This sea has become an important recipient of alien species transported with ballast water from all over the world. Sibling species are a special group of invasive animals that are hardly distinguishable from relative but often ecologically different local species. In this study, a molecular genetic diagnosis was performed, based on the analysis of DNA nucleotide sequences (barcoding) in the populations of a dominant circumpolar species Eurytemora affinis (Poppe, 1880) from the Gulf of Finland and the Atlantic coast of European estuaries and of Eurytemora carolleeae Alekseev and Souissi, 2011, a new North American suspected invasive form. The results of the diagnosis were completed by morphological analyses. Considering the key role of E. affinis in the Baltic Sea zooplankton community, the invasion of E. carolleeae might have consequences for biodiversity, biogeography, conservation and ecosystem management in this area.

AB  - Economic and environmental developments in the last decades call for the displacement of fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. Biofuels are considered as a part of the solution for this challenge. Sustainable raw materials for the production of transportation biofuels such as biodiesel, biobutanol and bioethanol, can be obtained from algal biomass. In particular, marine macroalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for transportation biofuels because of (the) its fast growth and its potential cultivation on seawater, avoiding competition of resources with conventional agriculture of terrestrial plants used for food. In addition, dissolved inorganic nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon are taken up by macroalgae, helping to alleviate eutrophication in seas and oceans. Using biological, chemical and engineering advances in the last decades, technologies to provide cost efficient cultivation, harvesting, extraction and processing of sustainable biofuels have to be elaborated. This paper provides a review of macroalgae based biorefineries with offshore cultivation and consequent biomass conversion into transportation liquid biofuels. We discuss the methods for offshore cultivation, harvesting, and conversion of macroalgae biomass into liquid transportation biofuels. Based on the current information and global experience, we present local perspectives specific for France, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Israel on the potential use of Exclusive Economic Zone for transportation biofuels production. Marketable suggestions for future research need to include all stakeholders of a given site for offshore biorefinery development.

AB  - Natural disturbances and subsequent outbreaks of forest insects led to unprecedented amounts of damaged timber. In Eurasia, the European Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus) breeding in Norway spruce (Picea abies) is creating the main share of infested trees in recent years. As alternative to salvage logging, different technics of mechanical and manual methods of bark removal for pest control are frequently applied in areas with conser- vation status or in protective forests that mitigate or prevent the impact of a natural hazard. To test the field applicability of bark removal technics, we compare work productivity mirroring economic costs between the widely used manual debarking and the new technique of bark gouging. Additionally, we evaluate how pest control and non-target biodiversity are affected from bark gouging if the phloem is cut with decreasing accuracy mirroring practical application by forest enterprises. Based on data of an experimental design we show, that bark gouging is twice as fast as manual debarking. From complete debarked P. abies logs no I. typographus emerged (pest control efficiency of 100%) but diversity of other emerging beetle species is reduced near zero. If bark gouging is conducted with high accuracy (phloem sufficiently cut in more than half of stripes) pest control ef- ficiency is 99.9% and for low accuracy (below 50%) pest control efficiency is still 95.7%. Non-target beetle diversity increases with reduced accuracy. Bark gouging combines sufficed pest control with biodiversity con- servation at lower work productivity than manual debarking and can thus be recommended for protected areas and protective forests, in particular.

AB  - The tradition to blaze trees to mark trails and boundaries is very old in northern Scandinavia. The disappearance of culturally modified trees (i.e. trees with trail blazes) and changes in forest structure along a section of an old bridle trail in boreal Sweden was analyzed using historical maps and forest surveys from the period 1876 to the year 2000. Remaining blazed trees were located during a field study and selected scars were dated. In total 104 scarred living and dead trees were found. The scars originated from the early 1500s to the early 1900s. Analysis of the forest surveys showed that the forest along the trail was dominated by older trees, and that the majority of the scarred trees probably were present, throughout the 19(th) century. By the mid 20(th) century logging had begun to affect the tree age along the trail and in 1974 no stands older than 180 years were present. A conservative estimate shows that around 90% of the original blazed trees have vanished. The trail was interpreted as have being lined for centuries with scarred trees which gradually have been destroyed during the 20(th) century. Culturally modified trees constitute an unique source of information for understanding pattern of old trails as well as of past human land use and movement in the landscape prior to the 20(th) century. This biological archive have to a large extent been destroyed by forestry activities and it is therefore very important to survey, recount and protect the trees that are still present.

AB  - This paper is focused on implementation challenges related to the integration of sustainable mobility in strategic local/regional land use and transport planning. The work was based on a case study of Stockholm, Sweden, focusing on four current plans and strategies of key importance for sustainable mobility. We identify and discuss implementation challenges related to sustainable mobility using a theoretical framework from the policy integration literature, with a focus on the dimensions of "layering", "drift" and "exhaustion" (Rayner & Howlett 2009). The empirical analysis led us to identify a complementary dimension which we call 'Parallel policy making'. The parallel policy making reflects a fundamental lack of integration of sustainable mobility in policies and plans of strategic importance, which hinders effective policy integration. Altogether, we conclude that a better insight into the practice of parallel policy making is crucial for development of more effective implementation strategies for sustainable mobility in Stockholm and elsewhere.

AB  - Technological revolution, change of techno-economic paradigms, globalization transformed the world economy's structure and reorganized people's lives. During many years of discussion about how to deal with the huge architectural, ecological and social-cultural heritage of the Industrial age they have concluded that unconcerned destruction of former enterprises would lead to the loss of the entire historical layer. A way out has been found in re-use of buildings, museumification of the selected mining industrial territories, underground space, using them for recreation.
   The society's interest in such examples of the industrial past is related to their uncommon anthropogenic landscape, cultural value and educative resource.
   Despite many examples of re-use of mining-industrial heritage immovable items, consistent theoretical approaches to the estimation of cultural value and economic capacity of such objects have not been developed by now. Consequently, they try to convert every plant that ceased its industrial activity into a monument thus multiplying their total quantity and devaluing the very concept of "heritage". The authors of the article generalize practical experience on studying historical-geological resources in Russia and Finland, suggest general methodical basis for the prospective assessment of these objects' commercialization to be developed. An integrated cross-disciplinary character of works on introducing the sites of mining-industrial heritage into tourist turnover and the need in scientific support of works should be noted.
   Science opinion is to be made for every object of mining-industrial heritage that is potentially considered as a tourist site. The analysis includes assessment of its unique character, visual performances, degree of it preservation (what to show) and information richness (what to tell), convenience of geographic location, ecological performance and safety requirements. Based on the analysis volume of investments in the object to create baseline conditions for safe and comfortable recreation is derived.
   Mining-industrial heritage objects are demanded economic resources and can be seen as a prospective source of economic growth for local societies. Comprehensive scientific study of such potential sites of tourist interest is the most important component for preparing them to be introduced into tourist turnover.

AB  - We surveyed 110 country churches in south-western Sweden for presence of brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus in summer 2016 by visual inspection and/or evening emergence counts. Each church was also classified according to the presence and amount of aesthetic directional lights (floodlights) aimed on its walls and tower from the outside. Sixty-one of the churches had previously been surveyed by one of us (J.R.) between 1980 and 1990, before lights were installed on Swedish churches, using the same methods. Churches with bat colonies had decreased significantly in frequency from 61% in 1980s to 38% by 2016. All abandoned churches had been fitted with flood-lights in the period between the two surveys. The loss of bat colonies from lit churches was highly significant and most obvious when lights were applied from all directions, leaving no dark corridor for the bats to leave and return to the roost. In contrast, in churches that were not lit, all of 13 bat colonies remained after 25+ years between the surveys. Lighting of churches and other historical buildings is a serious threat to the long-term survival and reproduction of light-averse bats such as Plecotus spp. and other slow-flying species. Bat roosts are strictly protected according to the EU Habitats Directive and the EUROBATS agreement. Lighting of buildings for aesthetic purposes is becoming a serious environmental issue, because important bat roosts are destroyed in large numbers, and the problem should be handled accordingly. As a start, installation of flood-lights on historical buildings should at least require an environmental impact assessment (EIA).

AB  - Bike sharing is one of the most promising urban planning interventions to facilitate an all-necessary transition towards a more sustainable transport paradigm. Regardless of the fact that hundreds of schemes run in more than 50 countries worldwide, bike sharing is still moderately investigated by research. This paper reports on a primarily quantitative study of 558 responses that was set to frame attitudes reflecting public acceptance towards the rapidly expanding bike-sharing scheme in Gothenburg, Sweden (Styr & Stall), in an attempt to identify the 'formula for success'. The respondents generally believed that Styr & Stall is a pro-environmental, inexpensive and healthy transport mode, which complements the city's public transport services and promotes a more human-friendly identity for Gothenburg. Even the respondents that self-reported a small (or no) likelihood to use bike sharing were positive towards the scheme. This means that they recognise that bike sharing has a significant pro-social potential and is not a system favouring a particular road-user segment over others that might not be interested or able to use it. The fact that the majority of the respondents do not use the scheme and yet its popularity is still vast indicates that there is much potential for more use in real terms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relative roles of the norm activation model (NAM), transport priorities and situational constraints (car ownership, distances, gender and age) while considering spatial heterogeneity on university trips among students in the winter season. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among university students (n = 441) at the two largest university campuses in Trondheim (Dragvoll and Gloshaugen), Norway. Linear mixed model analyses showed that Dragvoll campus, allocated in a rural area of the city, was associated with more use of car and public transportation (bus or tram), and less active transportation (walking or bicycling) than Gloshaugen campus which is located in an urban area. While adjusting for spatial heterogeneity, the findings showed that situational constraints were somewhat more important for mode use than psychological variables. Car ownership was associated with more car use and less use of public transportation. Longer walking time from students' residence to university was related to more use of public transportation and less active transportation. Strong priorities of physical activity were related to less public transportation mode use and more use of active transportation. Increased awareness of the negative consequences of car use was associated with more use of active transportation and less car use. Those who strongly prioritized convenience when choosing transportation modes tended to use a car. To further promote sustainable transportation mode use on university trips among Norwegian students it may valid to focus on situational constraints. However, psychological variables such as the awareness of consequences component in the NAM and psychological priorities could also be relevant for students' mode use in this season.

AB  - "Sustainability" and "sustainable tourism" are widely debated concepts in tourism worldwide. However, the specific meaning of both concepts across different cultures has not been fully researched, and the terms are frequently assumed to have identical meanings to audiences from different cultures. We aim to close this research gap by studying how tourists from four different countries define and conceptualise "sustainability" and "sustainable tourism." Specifically, we asked participants from Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United States to define "sustainability" and "sustainable tourism" using open ended questions in a qualitative study. We study the responses using an interdisciplinary framework which is based on research from tourism, intercultural studies, linguistics, and cognitive psychology. The findings show significant cross-cultural differences in respondents' interpretations of sustainability and sustainable tourism, regarding both the content and the linguistic form of the definitions. Our research challenges the silent assumption that consumers worldwide share a common understanding of sustainability in tourism. We conclude that strategies for promoting sustainability and sustainable tourism must use strong verbal and visual cues tailored to the culture and language of diverse target groups. This includes the use of meaningful culture-specific symbols representing sustainability. Additionally, tourism researchers should be aware that an injudicious transfer of polysemous terms such as "sustainability" and "sustainable tourism" across different contexts and study designs may bias research results.

AB  - We propose entrepreneurial bricolage as a framework that enables the description, explanation and exploration of the modus operandi of tourism micro-firms. Particularly, the notion of spatial bricolage constitutes fertile ground for further research and theoretical advances of sustainable tourism entrepreneurship. The potential for rural tourism development is conditioned by entrepreneurs' capability to utilise local physical and non-material resources sustainably. Thus, knowledge about the resourcing behaviour of micro-firms is paramount to understanding their role in promoting sustainable tourism. This study explores how rural micro-firms interact with their spatial environment to design tourism value propositions. Our analysis is based on interviews with eighteen owners-managers of tourism micro-firms in rural Sweden. We portray spatial bricolage as a resourcing behaviour that builds on the re-interpretation of existing resources, the unique features of the destination and community involvement. The findings suggest that resource transfer facilitates sustainable development since it enables long-term planning and validates the entrepreneurs' operation. Moreover, their small-scale enables rural tourism firms to utilise local resources in non-exploitative ways that minimise disturbance for other stakeholders.

AB  - Improvement of energy efficiency of buildings and waste water treatment are in key role in rural development in Finland. Although information on both subjects is widely available nowadays, actions are still lacking. The goal of this development project is to activate the residents of the rural areas to take action to improve their environmental performance through improvements in energy efficiency of housing, waste management and waste water treatment. The project uses the common village houses to demonstrate the activity path to improvements and to ignite action in the residents through the joint volunteering and project implementation. The village houses in Finland have cultural and historic value and the hub of many village activities. At the same time, this approach guarantees the project results remain in the village among the residents. In addition, the project develops a guideline and a DVD material on the project implementation.
   The development project is a great example of the role of university of applied science in the regional development with multidisciplinary approach and practical implementation of the scientific research. This paper describes the project plan for rural development that aims to activate residents for better environment.

I have two main aims in this paper. First, I explore the local forest economy, looking at how it works and how it is structured. This I do by focusing on the multilevel well-being of key actors and by exploring the motives lying behind the behaviours and decisions of people working within the forest economy, particularly forest owners. Second, I identify and describe the principles that can help uncover the conflicts and contradictions between forest economy and conservation planning and create a framework for innovative solutions to such contradictions on the local level.

AB  - This study analyses the winter colonization of an archipelago of 31 forests (0.1-350 ha) in central Spain by the guild of pariforms (Parus, Aegithalos, Regulus, Sitta and Certhia). Two hypotheses are considered (a) that birds with similar habitat preferences tend to disappear simultaneously with the reduction in forest size, leading to a 'nested' pattern of species distribution; or (b) that the species in the smallest forests are a random sample of those found in the larger ones. The results support hypothesis (a). The species that depend on relatively scarce resources, such as tree trunks and junipers Juniperus thurifera (Sitta europaea, Certhia brachydactyla, Parus cristatus and P.ater) only occupied the largest forests. On the other hand, species that exploit abundant, ubiquitous resources, such as helm oak Quercus ilex foliage (Regulus ignicapillus and Parus caeruleus), were distributed uniformly throughout all the fragments. These results emphasize the need for a better understanding of habitat selection by species when designing conservation strategies for fragmented populations.

AB  - Large scale use of even-aged silviculture (clear-cutting) commencing in the mid-20th century has had negative impacts on forest biodiversity. As a consequence, uneven-aged silviculture is currently being considered to help meet the ecological and social criteria required for sustainable forest management. Uneven-aged silviculture (e.g. selective felling) involves selective removal of some older trees in a stand which may to some extent mimics natural small scale stand dynamics and thus potentially benefit species associated with old forests. Here we test whether selective felling benefits beetle biodiversity by producing beetle assemblages that better resemble those of old growth stands than those found in uncut production stands. We conducted a field study in northern Sweden, comparing beetles assemblages collected with window traps in three spruce dominated stand types: (1) Stands recently (on average 7 years prior to the study) subjected to selective felling (Selective felling), (2) mature uneven-aged stands without recent history of management, resembling selective felling stands prior to management (Uncut), and (3) old-growth stands with high conservation values (Old growth). As predicted, we found that assemblage composition was similar in selective felling and old growth stands, and that assemblages of cambivores and obligate saproxylics (marginally significant) differed between these two stand types and uncut stands. The differences were largely explained by a higher abundance of saproxylic species presumably associated with old growth conditions and large volumes of deadwood. Thus, although overall assemblage composition did not differ between stand types, part of the beetle community seemingly benefited from selective felling. We therefore recommend that selective felling is considered as an alternative to clear-felling to maintain biodiversity values. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An RAS Presidium meeting considered the causes and effects of negative environmental changes in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, the estuary of the Neva River, whose catchment area hosts a very rapidly developing Russian region. Studies of the Neva estuary ecosystems by the RAS Zoological Institute over more than 20 years have shown that the increased anthropogenic load on the gulf ecosystem, including the growing transportation of energy sources, is coupled with unfriendly climatic factors. This situation necessitates the development of a strategy to control the environment in the eastern Gulf of Finland and to account for the complex dynamics of its ecosystem. This publication is based on the materials of this RAS Presidium meeting.

AB  - Small-bodied wrasse species are important for structuring coastal marine ecosystems but are also increasingly harvested as parasite cleaners on farmed salmon. Identifying management regulations that will support long-term sustainability of wrasse fisheries is challenging, because there is still limited knowledge about the impacts of fisheries on the demography of these intermediate predators in their natural environments. To this end, we studied individual growth histories of goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) at a fine spatial scale across replicated marine protected areas (MPAs) and areas open to commercial harvesting on the Norwegian coast. The MPAs were established 1-7years prior to our sampling. We detected significant fine-scale spatial variation in wrasse asymptotic body size, but found no consistent difference between MPAs and fished areas. Male wrasses reached larger asymptotic body sizes than females, whereas fyke nets captured individuals with larger asymptotic body sizes compared with baited traps. These are the two commonly used gear types in wrasse fisheries. An extended use of baited traps, along with slot-size limits, could therefore aid in protecting large-growing phenotypes such as nest-guarding males.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two elements contributing to many environmental problems, such as eutrophication, global change (N) and acidification (N). Mitigation of the negative environmental impacts caused by these nutrients requires understanding of their amounts and linkages through inputs and outputs of the different parts of the ecological and societal system. In this study, the stocks and flows of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Finnish food production and consumption system were identified and quantified. An average of each stock and flow was calculated for the period from 1995 to 1999. Total inputs to Finnish agricultural soil were estimated to be 276 500 t N a(-1) and 48 100 t P a(-1), whereas total outputs were approximately 223 500 t N a(-1) and 24 500 t P a(-1). These figures indicate a calculatory nutrient surplus of ca. 29 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) and 13 kg P ha(-1) a(-1) on agricultural land. Currently, the Finnish food production and consumption nutrient system is open, and significant nutrient, especially nitrogen, losses to waters, air and soil (landfills) occur in several parts of the system. Main losses occur during the agricultural production phase. Even if it would be technically and economically possible to return all the nutrients in municipal organic waste to the agricultural soil, these could only replace ca. 17% of the nutrients annually applied in agricultural soil in form of inorganic fertilizers. Other ways to improve nutrient use efficiency are discussed. These include quality control and quality assurance of the production systems and education of farmers to achieve similar yields with less nutrient inputs or smaller agricultural area. Environmental subsidy system may also encourage more efficient nutrient cycling. Several factors, including variation in nutrient concentrations and dry weights and possible inaccuracy of statistics, affect the calculations. Results from an uncertainty analysis indicated that soil inputs varied between 248 400 and 311 300 t N a(-1) and 43 900 and 53 200 t P a(-1). The outputs varied between 174 200 and 303 400 t N a(-1) and 21500 and 28 300 t P a(-1). Uncertainties were particularly high for N largely related to the difficulties in estimating N2O emission and denitrification losses. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores the role that heritage might play in the representation of 'difference', within the context of neoliberal cities. The case is a large-scale urban change in the former working-class neighborhood of Gamlestaden, Sweden. Interviews and on-site observations revealed how authorized heritage practices can enable the celebration of particular social and cultural values, while naturalizing the erasure of others. People's cultural diversity, and diverging interpretations of the past, have been guided by the power of heritage into a process of subjectification, according to which only 'unthreatening' forms of cultural diversity were celebrated and revealed legitimate. The 'fetishized' difference and particular historical records have served to conceal the political interest at stake in its' production and maintenance, and led to a politicised representation of cultural diversity through what Annie Coombes' terms 'scopic feast'. All this was made possible through BID, the first neoliberal business improvement district model in Sweden, and its investment in a deeply rooted process of heritageisation. Uncritical engagement with difference in the context of heritage management and neoliberal urban development, make it appear almost natural to erase the cultural values that fall outside the authorized narrative of value.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of trends in culinary taste in Finland since the mid-1990s, a period characterized by rapid socio-cultural change, including changes in the area of food and drink. What culinary taste patterns can be identified among food and drink preferences in Finland? Are these patterns differentiated by socio-demographic characteristics? Have the shapes of culinary taste patterns and the way they are socially structured changed in recent years? These questions are analyzed using data from two nationally representative surveys collected in 1995 and 2007. The results show that the basic structure behind Finnish culinary taste revolves around the distinction between "modern" light/ethnic eating and "traditional" (often national) heavy/meat eating. Both patterns have clearly differentiated social profiles in terms of gender, age, education and geographical region. Somewhat unexpectedly, the main results show a striking stability over time. However, a more pronounced change could be detected in table beverage preferences than in foods.

AB  - Centralized power production mainly from fossil fuels is increasingly challenged by decentralized power production from renewables. This is a trend caused by the greening of the European power grid which is to be carbon neutral by 2050. As a part of this trend, the number of power-producing buildings is growing. Even in Norway, which has a highly centralized power production based on hydropower, buildings are increasingly equipped with solar power panels. The introduction of cross-sectoral innovations like power producing buildings is likely to encounter resistance, as the conventional system and its powerful actors are challenged. The strategies to either promote or block the growth of power producing buildings in Norway have been explored employing the Strategic Niche Management framework.
   For this paper, 32 interviews were conducted with decision-makers and experts, both advocates and opponents of power-producing buildings. It has been found that narratives have the potential to work as a bridging device between the niche and the regime. If the narrative supporting power-producing buildings should become a bridging device, it would have to address challenges as defined by the regime incumbents. In Norway, this would be equivalent to addressing the challenge of peak load.

AB  - Despite a considerable research interest in relationships between abundance and distribution across species not so many studies have examined this relationship within species. We investigated the relationship between regional distribution and local abundance in the grassland plant Carlina vulgaris (Asteraceae) within and between two regions in southern Sweden. In contrast to what is usually hypothesised, no positive relationship was found between the distribution and abundance of C. vulgaris within the regions, and between regions there was a negative relationship between large-scale distribution and local abundance. A seed-sowing and transplantation experiment suggested that there is no difference in the amount of suitable but unoccupied habitats between the regions, and unoccupied sites were more favourable than occupied sites. The mechanism behind the observed abundance distribution pattern in C. vulgaris could be either a time-lag in population change response, or a negative correlation in resources between the regions.

AB  - Atmospheric circulation generally influences regional climate variability and thereby controls catchment hydrology and consequently transport of elements in natural riverine systems. This study examined dependencies between total organic carbon (TOC) variability in the River Oulujoki (Finland) during 1963-2011 and prominent atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs), which manifest natural climatic conditions over Finland and control hydrological processes in the river catchment. North Atlantic Oscillation, Scandinavia, East Atlantic and East Atlantic/West Russia patterns were statistically significant ACPs affecting variations in TOC export at River Oulujoki lower basin area. In the River Oulujoki, TOC export was largely controlled by changes in TOC fluxes generated from tributaries of river and near areas to its main channel. Besides, runoff from Lake Oulujarvi slightly influenced TOC export variability in the River Oulujoki. Understanding such responses of TOC fluxes to ACPs is a useful tool for sustainable water resources planning and management on regional and local scales.

AB  - Sustainable cites require the capacity to live with difference. In a world of increased mobility and migration, our cities become more and more diversified. While national discourses on diversity are often problem-focused, social initiatives are emerging in diverse cities addressing the positive potential of the city as a cross-cultural meeting place. In Norway, such initiatives have increased in number since "the refugee crisis" in 2015, and we see creative approaches arising from civil society, the voluntary sector, private companies, and local governments aiming to facilitate encounters with difference. This article explores innovative integration initiatives in cities in the north, emphasizing how difference might be negotiated, engendering new forms of engagement and responsibility. Cities are seen as sites of experiments, where new relations across difference are developed. Framing encounters as emergent, transitory, fragile, yet hopeful, we discuss the transformative powers of such initiatives for planning in diverse cities.

AB  - Landscape variability due to anthropogenic pressure poses a risk to the existence of valuable and unique landscapes. It once became the reason for raising the issue of landscape protection in Europe, paying special attention to landscapes of national importance by giving them a special status. In European practice, the granting of the status of a landscape of national importance to certain territories is based on a long tradition. In England and Scotland, it was started in 1949, separating nature protection and landscape protection directly into laws and regulations, and also later by identifying and mapping the country's most important landscapes, developing guidelines for landscape protection, planning and management, and setting up national landscape protection institutions. Later, in 1992, Finland also granted a special status to its particularly important landscapes. In general, this establishing method is similar to the UK experience. The experience of France, on the other hand, is based on exploiting the potential of the landscape for tourism, by branding specific landscapes and linking them in a single network. The traditions of European countries in identifying and managing landscapes of national importance are different, but they are mainly based on the desire of each country to highlight and preserve its special and important landscapes both as real territories and as symbols of national identity. This article analyses the understanding of national landscapes, comparing the examples of individual European countries, as well as the experience of Latvia, with the aim to determine the best basis and method for Latvia to identify, protect and manage national landscapes.

AB  - To devise effective conservation actions, it is important to know which factors are associated with the population parameters of a declining population. Using mark-recapture methods, we estimated the annual population size, growth rate and survival probability of an ear-tagged flying squirrel population over a 15-year period in a 4,500 ha study area in western Finland. The species is considered vulnerable, but detailed knowledge concerning population sizes or trends is lacking. The population parameters and changes therein were regressed against habitat availability, an indicator of predation pressure, and mean winter temperature (an indicator of climate change), to reveal potential reasons for trends in the population. The best-fit models suggested the annual growth rate to be below one, and on average it was 0.93 (+/- 0.06; SE) across the 15-year period. The survival probability was about 0.22 (+/- 0.03) for juveniles and 0.50 (+/- 0.03) for adults. The population size of adult flying squirrels decreased from 65 (+/- 11) individuals in 1995 to 29 (+/- 6) individuals in 2009. The number of flying squirrels was associated with the amount of available habitat, but the decline in population size was more rapid than the loss of habitat area. If the current decreasing trend in habitat availability continues, the population might become extinct by the year 2020. To halt the population decline, it is necessary to refrain from clear-cutting mature spruce stands until new suitable habitats develop from the maturation of younger forests.

AB  - Deadwood is a key element in forest ecosystems contributing to biodiversity conservation, carbon (C) stocking and cycling, and nutrient inputs to soil. Forest management has an important role to maintain deadwood temporary C stock by regulating the amount of deadwood in forests during harvesting operations. Deadwood C stocks can be estimated directly, by measuring C concentration in deadwood samples, or indirectly, by converting the biomass into the amount of C stored in the deadwood. The aim of the study was (1) to compare direct and indirect methods for deadwood C stocks estimation; (2) to determine differences between the two methods; and (3) to evaluate the most appropriate, easiest, and least expensive method depending on specific circumstances. The investigation was implemented in a Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia Ten. subsp. brutia) forest located in Central Italy. In 18 sample plots, deadwood biomass was measured separately by component (logs, snags, stumps) and decay class. During a field survey, 150 deadwood samples were collected and analyzed in the laboratory for moisture content, mass determination, and direct and indirect estimation of C content. The results showed small differences in the estimation of deadwood ( stock using direct and indirect methods. We propose that indirect estimation of C stock, which is less demanding of time and monetary resources, can replace direct estimation, and using the same coefficient for different deadwood components and decay classes produces reliable estimates.

AB  - Climate has an important influence on the travel decisions of tourists. This paper reviews the distinct lines of inquiry that have been used to examine the influence of climate on tourist decision making, and attempts to define optimal climatic conditions for tourism. The study examined tourist perceptions of optimal climatic conditions (for temperature, sunshine, wind) and the relative importance of 4 climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation, sunshine, wind) in 3 major tourism environments (beach-coastal, urban, mountains). A survey instrument was administered to university students (n = 831) representing the young-adult travel segment, in 3 countries (Canada, New Zealand, Sweden). Three salient findings include: significant variation in the perceived optimum climatic conditions for the 3 major tourism environments, differences in the relative importance of the 4 climatic parameters in the 3 tourism environments, and similarities as well as differences in the climatic preferences of respondents from the 3 nations. These findings have several implications for the literature on climate and tourism, including the development of climate indices for tourism, destination choice and travel pattern modelling, and climate change impact assessments. When applied to a broader cross-cultural sample of tourist segments, the present approach could potentially reveal the complexities of tourist preferences for climate.

AB  - The article examines the role of the tourism industry in the world economy, reveals the specifics of the innovation process in tourism. The classification of innovations in tourism according to the object of their application is given. The main directions of using innovative marketing technologies in the field of tourism services are considered: release of new types of tourism product, change in the organization of production and consumption, identification and use of new markets, as well as the use of new equipment and technology. Factors that accelerate the introduction of marketing innovations are studied. Based on the analysis of world experience, several models of regulation of innovative tour operating activities in the EU have been identified. The first direction of formation of the model of the innovations development in tourism is the activity of stimulating innovations in the public and private sectors of tourism with the aim of their transition to a qualitatively new model of touring (similar model is used in Greece, Italy and Portugal). The second direction is defined as the internationalization and opening of new markets (a similar model of stimulating innovative development is typical of Spain, Romania and partly Norway). The third one includes support for entrepreneurship in the field of tourism, stimulation of entrepreneurial initiatives, opening a new tourism business (A similar model of stimulating innovation in tourism is typical of many countries in Europe, Australia, New Zealand). The fourth direction is the promotion of the country, its tourism product, including educational and cultural ones (A similar model is typical of Bulgaria, Croatia, Spain, Turkey, Thailand). The role of introduction and active development of e-business and marketing technologies is defined, especially in modern conditions. The necessity of development of the newest directions of the Internet marketing in the field of tourism, including mobile, Internet branding and geomarketing, is proved. The role of innovative marketing technologies as one of the central elements of modern development of activity of tourist firms, the necessity of application of computer technologies and non-standard ways of giving of the information during carrying out modern technical maintenance, are justified. The first group of such technological solutions consists of management technologies, including property management system (PMS), aimed at optimization of basic technological operations. The modern hotels and chains are trying to present themselves not only in global distribution system (GDS), which has become a powerful advertising tool, but also in alternative distribution system (ADS), which is primarily needed by hotels focused on the business segment. Global distribution system (GDS) is also closely integrated into well-known booking systems such as Booking.com, HRS, Agoda, Travelocity, Expedia etc. The next group is for food and beverages inventory management technology (F&B). The group of marketing technologies includes search engine optimization measures (SEO and PPC), which allow to raise the hotel site in search engine rankings, E-mail Marketing as a means of maintaining constant communication with the client, marketing activities in social media (Social Media Optimization), creation of virtual hotels or illusions of visiting a hotel (Second Life and Virtual Hotels Conclusion), branding, etc. The last group of technologies are service ones, i.e. technologies for improving hotel products and services.
   Innovative technologies are developing in the direction of ensuring sustainable development (greening of hotel services and activities), inclusion in traditional technological operations of innovative components: electronic concierge terminals, access to hotel services via mobile devices, maximizing Internet access, etc. Based on the analysis of the activities of large tour operators, regional differences have been identified in Turkey, Greece, Croatia, Spain, Austria, Norway and France. It is proved that marketing innovations in tourism have a qualitative novelty, which affects the promising areas of tourism development, improvement of existing tourism products, improving the image and competitiveness of the tourism industry. Based on the study, it is generalized that the role of marketing innovations in international tourism has been growing every year, and it has become especially relevant in the conditions of the COVID-19 crisis. For travel companies, the effect of marketing innovation can be expressed in the qualitatively new changes in the tourism industry, improving the efficiency of tourism infrastructure, management of sustainable operation and development of tourism in the country and the formation, positioning and consumption of tourism services, improving the image and competitiveness of travel companies.

AB  - 'Nature-Based Integration' (NBI) has been proposed as a solution to two prominent issues in contemporary Nordic societies: increasing separation from nature among 'modern' societies; and the need to 'integrate' groups of diverse newcomers. This article examines NBI activities in orebro County, central Sweden, exploring how these practices seek to bring immigrants into a shared Swedish experiential landscape that forms part of the work of ordering Sweden as a community. These activities form part of an ordering project, within which 'Swedes' and 'newcomers' are situated, drawing on extant nationalist orderings. Likewise, it represents part of an effort to enact a sustainable Sweden in an international world. Drawing on research on environmental racism and (in)justice, this article homes in on the norms implicit and explicit to this ordering. It then discusses the implications of this, highlighting (arguably unavoidable) coercive elements. Furthermore, the long history of outdoor lifestyle as a pillar of Swedish nationalism and the embracing of such activities by the Swedish far right highlight that nature may also become a site of conflict as much as conciliation. Finally, the article considers the types of environmental action arising from the NBI orderings and the likelihood of meaningful environmental change.

AB  - Y The concept of smart tourism destinations has gained increased attention in research literature and among tourism stakeholders. However, the concept is still considered in need of more in-depth explanations for understanding and making sense of the notion. The contribution of the concept of smart tourism destinations to managerially relevant knowledge is particularly difficult to assess due to its complexity. Therefore, a qualitative text analysis of stakeholder interviews is proposed and conducted using the GABEK (R) methodology to identify recurring themes in the stakeholders' understanding of smart tourism destinations. The GABEK (R) methodology aims to represent the texts of open interviews as networks of interrelated keywords to make sense of a complex phenomenon. This study explores how destination stakeholders from two different Swedish destinations make sense of the concept of smart tourism destinations. Study findings show that, from the destination stakeholders' point of view, there is a need to counterbalance the currently dominant focus on technology with softer though more existential values to construct a sustainable path of destination development. As for the theoretical contribution, this study clarifies properties of smart tourism destinations and stakeholders' sense-making of the concept of smart tourism destination.

AB  - BackgroundWestern lifestyle is associated with high prevalence of allergy, asthma and other chronic inflammatory disorders. To explain this association, we tested the biodiversity hypothesis', which posits that reduced contact of children with environmental biodiversity, including environmental microbiota in natural habitats, has adverse consequences on the assembly of human commensal microbiota and its contribution to immune tolerance.
   MethodsWe analysed four study cohorts from Finland and Estonia (n=1044) comprising children and adolescents aged 0.5-20years. The prevalence of atopic sensitization was assessed by measuring serum IgE specific to inhalant allergens. We calculated the proportion of five land-use types - forest, agricultural land, built areas, wetlands and water bodies - in the landscape around the homes using the CORINE2006 classification.
   ResultsThe cover of forest and agricultural land within 2-5km from the home was inversely and significantly associated with atopic sensitization. This relationship was observed for children 6years of age and older. Land-use pattern explained 20% of the variation in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria on the skin of healthy individuals, supporting the hypothesis of a strong environmental effect on the commensal microbiota.
   ConclusionsThe amount of green environment (forest and agricultural land) around homes was inversely associated with the risk of atopic sensitization in children. The results indicate that early-life exposure to green environments is especially important. The environmental effect may be mediated via the effect of environmental microbiota on the commensal microbiota influencing immunotolerance.

AB  - An ensemble of nutrient models was applied in 17 European catchments to analyse the variation that appears after simulation of net nutrient loads and partitioning of nutrient loads at catchment scale. Eight models for N and five models for P were applied in three core catchments covering European-wide gradients in climate, topography, soil types and land use (Vansjo-Hobol (Norway), Ouse (Yorkshire, UK) and Enza (Italy)). Moreover, each of the models was applied in 3-14 other EUROHARP catchments in order to inter-compare the outcome of the nutrient load partitioning at a wider European scale. The results of the nutrient load partitioning show a variation in the computed average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loss from agricultural land within the 17 catchments between 19.1-34.6 kg N ha(-1) and 0.12-1.67 kg P ha(-1). All the applied nutrient models show that the catchment specific variation (range and standard deviation) in the model results is lowest when simulating the net nutrient load and becomes increasingly higher for simulation of the gross nutrient loss from agricultural land and highest for the simulations of the gross nutrient loss from other diffuse sources in the core catchments. The average coefficient of variation for the model simulations of gross P loss from agricultural land is nearly twice as high (67%) as for the model simulations of gross N loss from agricultural land (40%). The variation involved in model simulations of net nutrient load and gross nutrient losses in European catchments was due to regional factors and the presence or absence of large lakes within the catchment.

AB  - Colosseum is a large office building in the capital region of Finland. The building owner operates on the highly competitive office rental market. With increasing emphasis on environmental responsibility, energy efficiency and sustainable energy solutions can provide competitive edge on the rental market. This study evaluates in terms of multiple criteria different alternatives to enhance the energy solutions of the building. The alternatives included different configurations of solar power, ground source heat, and roof constructions, along with district heating. Decision criteria included internal rate of return, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, and attractiveness. Attractiveness was evaluated by a set of experts in office building valuation. The alternatives were compared using Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), which is a simulation based method for decision problems where different kinds of uncertain information are represented by probability distributions. As novelty, the pairwise winning indices were used to form a stochastic ranking of alternatives. Analyses were conducted both without and with decision maker's preference information. Most preferred alternatives were based on ground source heat. However, these alternatives require extensive renovation to install a hydronic central heating system. If such renovation is considered infeasible, then solar power alternatives become most preferred.

AB  - Background: Food consumption is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures. Adoption of healthy diets is suggested to be an option for less environmentally intensive food habits and improved public health. In particular, changes in meat consumption are believed to bring potential benefits.
   Objective: To quantify the impact of changes in meat consumption on the dietary contribution of nutrients, GHG emissions and on land requirement.
   Design: Scenario analysis is performed for three scenarios representing different variants of meat consumption in Sweden. The reference scenario is based on average Swedish meat consumption while NUTR-1 and NUTR-2 are hypothetical scenarios in line with prevailing dietary guidelines. The results are evaluated in relation to the recommended daily intake of nutrients, international climate goals and global capacity for sustainable expansion of agricultural land. Uncertainties and variations in data are captured by using Monte Carlo simulation.
   Results: Meat consumption in line with nutritional guidelines, implying an approximate 25% reduction of Swedish average intake, reduces the contribution of total and saturated fat by 59-76%, energy, iron and zinc by about half and protein by one quarter. Restrictions in meat consumption are most critical for the intake of iron and zinc, whereas positive effects on public health are expected due to the reduced intake of saturated fat. Aligning meat consumption with dietary guidelines reduces GHG emissions from meat production from 40% to approximately 15-25% of the long-term (2050) per capita budget of sustainable GHG emissions and the share of per capita available cropland from 50% to 20-30%.
   Conclusions: This quantitative analysis suggests that beneficial synergies, in terms of public health, GHG emissions and land use pressure, can be provided by reducing current Swedish meat consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Universities are increasingly engaged in marketization and are also expected to transform into more sustainable institutions and be change-agents pushing forward the movement of sustainable development. This article introduces an analytical framework originated by Hahn et al. (2015) for understanding tensions concerning corporate sustainability to the context of the Finnish university system in order to answer the following questions: What are the tensions relating to Finnish universities' social and economic sustainability, and what strategies might universities use to cope with these tensions? Through analyzing interviews with university managers and officials from the Ministry of Education and Culture in Finland, we find that Hahn et al.'s framework is generally applicable in analyzing tensions of sustainability in universities, and we identify six tensions relating to the sustainability of Finnish universities. The tensions are related to (1) academic leadership and management legitimacy, (2) regional political tensions and university profiling, (3) political power over the university system, (4) changing academic work and profession, (5) academic autonomy and the role of the state, and (6) the future role of the university institution. Moreover, the article discusses issues regarding how to adapt the framework of corporate sustainability to the context of higher education.

AB  - This study used a synthetic evaluation method to assess agri-environmental externalities at the regional level in Finland. The article developed a relative measure that made it possible to rank the 15 regions studied for seven agri-environmental indicators, which were based on the preferences of the evaluators. The results indicated significant differences in the provision of public goods between the regions. The provision of public goods tended to increase over the 10-year study period. The results were robust with respect to changes in preferences.

AB  - Norway and the European Union (EU) are closely interlinked. However, one issue has arisen where interests have clashed: snow crab. A newcomer to Norwegian Arctic waters, this resource has attracted attention as projections of future profit have soared. Why is the EU pursuing a relatively minor issue over the right to catch snow crab in the Barents Sea? This issue has also brought to the fore the underlying disagreement between Norway and the EU over the status of the maritime zone and related continental shelf around the archipelago of Svalbard, stemming from the 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty. Is the EU using the snow-crab issue to challenge Norway's Svalbard regime? How are EUropean interests in this resource best understood? At stake are also the prospects of oil and gas, as well as Arctic governance and environmental protection. The EU is a multi-faceted creature, where special interests can hijack the machinery and bring issues to the table, depending on the circumstances. This article outlines these circumstances, as well as the process concerning the dispute over snow crab and the background, which relates to economic interests, but also international politics as well as law. Further, it examines the EU's interests, drawing on scholarly work on the EU's position on Svalbard and interviews with Brussels-based decision-makers, officials and politicians.

AB  - Management of semi-natural grasslands is essential to retain the characteristic diversity of flora and fauna found in these habitats. To maintain, restore or recreate favourable conditions for grassland species, knowledge regarding how they occur in relation to grazing intensity and soil nutrient availability is crucial. We focused on grassland plant species, i.e., species selected to indicate high natural values in semi-natural grasslands. Environmental monitoring data collected at 366 grassland sites in southern Sweden between 2006 and 2010 were used to relate the occurrence of indicator species to factors describing geographic location, local site conditions related to nutrients and moisture, and management. Site productivity, soil moisture and cover of trees and shrubs were the main structuring factors, while other factors related to management had a lesser effect (grass sward height, amount of litter, type of grazer). Not surprisingly, these patterns were also reflected in species-wise analyses of the 25 most commonly occurring indicator species, with almost all species negatively related to site productivity and most also to soil moisture. Furthermore, many species were negatively affected by increasing sward height and litter. In contrast, species-wise responses varied among species in relation to increasing cover of trees and shrubs. In comparison to cattle grazing, sheep grazing was detrimental to six species and beneficial to none, while horse grazing was detrimental to no species and beneficial to four species. When evaluating species traits, taller plant species were favoured when site productivity, grass sward height and the amount of grass litter were high. There were no strong patterns related to the flowering time, leaf arrangement, or nutrient and light requirements of species. These results highlight the importance of nutrient-poor and dry sites, e.g., when selecting sites for conservation, and the importance of the type of management executed.

AB  - To achieve their goal to become climate neutral, Swedish municipalities must significantly improve their transformative capacities. Adapting the roles and practices of urban planners is an important element in this process. This paper critically reflects on the way in which improved planning education may help to enable a new generation of planners to face the challenges of rapid urban transformation and provides them with the knowledge and tools needed for these new roles. The results suggest that there are interdependencies between the demand of municipalities for knowledge and skills and the capacity of educational programs for educating planners with transformative abilities.

AB  - We studied ptyctimous moss mites, which are characteristic of forest habitats, in Norwegian broadleaf forests considered as biodiversity hotspot areas in Fennoscandia. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of different factors (regional locality, annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest type, forest wetness and microhabitat) on the ptyctimous mites and on discovering their richness in broadleaf forests. Samples were collected from nine broadleaf forests in Western, Southern and Eastern Norway, in different climatic conditions, six forest types, three forest wetness states and eight microhabitats. Overall, 3341 ptyctimous mites were collected and their abundance differed significantly among the regions, forest types and microhabitats. Forest type turned out to be the most important factor, responsible for 24.5% of the total variation in the abundance of the ptyctimous mites. Other important factors were forest wetness and microhabitat. In total, 27 species, i.e., 87% of all ptyctimous mites known from before in Norway were found and the species richness was highest in the east and lowest in the west of the country. Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus was most common and most abundant; it made nearly 30% of all ptyctimous mites collected. On the other hand, a quarter of the species were represented by less than 10 specimens; most of these were new records for Norway. Among ten species discovered as new to Norway, four were also new to Fennoscandia. These findings confirm the unique character and high biological diversity of Norwegian broadleaf forests.

AB  - Many modern cities have strongly invested in the sustainability of their urban water management system. Nordic cities like Stockholm or Copenhagen are amongst pioneers in investments towards integrated urban water management. However, cities can never be fully self-sufficient due to their dependency on external (water) resources. In this paper, we quantify this water dependency with respect to food consumption in nine cities located in the five Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland), by means of the water footprint concept. Detailed urban water footprint assessments are scarce in the literature. By analysing national nutrition surveys, we find that urban food intake behaviour differs from national food intake behaviour. In large Nordic cities people eat generally less potatoes, milk products (without cheese), meat and animal fats and they drink less coffee than outside city borders. On the other hand, they generally eat more vegetables and vegetable oils and they drink more tea and alcoholic beverages. This leads consistently-for the six large Nordic cities Stockholm, Malmo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Reykjavik-to slightly smaller food related urban water footprints (-2 to -6%) than national average values. We also analyse the water footprint for different diets based upon Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) for these cities. We assessed three healthy diet scenarios: 1) including meat (HEALTHY-MEAT), 2) pesco-vegetarian (HEALTHY-PESCO-VEG) and 3) vegetarian (HEALTHY-VEG). This shows that Nordic urban dwellers 1) eat too many animal products (red meat, milk and milk products) and sugar and drink too much alcohol and 2) they eat not enough vegetables, fruit and products from the group pulses, nuts and oilcrops. Their overall energy and protein intake is too high. A shift to a healthy diet with recommended energy and protein intake reduces the urban WF related to food consumption substantially. A shift to HEALTHY-MEAT results in a reduction of -9 to -24%, for HEALTHY-PESCO-VEG the reduction is -29 to -37%, for HEALTHY-VEG the reduction is -36 to -44%. In other words, Nordic urban dwellers can save a lot of water by shifting to a healthy diet. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB  - Novel food production technologies are being developed to address the challenges of securing sustainable and healthy nutrition for the growing global population. This study assessed the environmental impacts of microbial protein (MP) produced by autotrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB). Data was collected from a company currently producing MP using HOB (hereafter simply referred to as MP) on a small-scale. Earlier studies have performed an environmental assessment of MP on a theoretical basis but no study yet has used empirical data. An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) with a cradle-to-gate approach was used to quantify global warming potential (GWP), land use, freshwater and marine eutrophication potential, water scarcity, human (non -)carcinogenic toxicity, and the cumulative energy demand (CED) of MP production in Finland. A Monte Carlo analysis was performed to assess uncertainties while a sensitivity analysis was used to explore the impacts of alternative production options and locations. The results were compared with animal-and plant-based protein sources for human consumption as well as protein sources for feed. Electricity consumption had the highest contribution to environmental impacts. Therefore, the source of energy had a substantial impact on the results. MP production using hydropower as an energy source yielded 87.5% lower GWP compared to using the average Finnish electricity mix. In comparison with animal-based protein sources for food production, MP had 53-100% lower environmental impacts depending on the reference product and the source of energy assumed for MP production. When compared with plant-based protein sources for food production, MP had lower land and water use requirements, and eutrophication potential but GWP was reduced only if low-emission energy sources were used. Compared to protein sources for feed production, MP production often resulted in lower environmental impact for GWP (FHE), land use, and eutrophication and acidification potential, but generally caused high water scarcity and required more energy.

AB  - Structures of architectural heritage are constantly exposed to natural and human-made threats that can compromise their cultural and artistic values. This is the case of the Roman city of Pompeii, whose preserving conditions nowadays are so critical to let a group of Unesco-appointed experts consider the possible inscription of the property on the list of "World Heritage in Danger". In this respect, improving the effectiveness of preservation strategies becomes a crucial task. A great contribution in this direction is given by the combination of digital technologies such as laser scanning, photogrammetry and computer vision-based techniques and 3D geographic information systems (3D GIS), whose integrated use could exponentially increase the effectiveness of conservation strategies of ancient buildings. This paper presents the results of a research developed as part of the Swedish Pompeii Project, a fieldwork initiated from the Swedish Institute in Rome in 2000. Main objectives of this research were (i) to develop a set of integrated digital methods to be extensively adopted by conservation specialists in the practice of preservation management; (ii) to deal with several aspects connected to the preservation of an ancient structure in a fully-3D' environment; (iii) to take advantage of GIS analytic tools for investigating architectural structures in three-dimensions.

AB  - The role of tourism in local development, combined with globalisation and climate change, are generating both opportunities and threats across Arctic communities. The impacts of climate change are felt more intensely in communities that are dependent on natural resources. This is increasingly occurring through Arctic tourism, which is often based on nature, and is the foundation of the economy of many small Arctic communities. The interplay between tourism and community-based adaptation represents a significant focus in Arctic tourism studies and can bring invaluable information to governments about the local level climate change impacts on livelihoods and on the potential future challenges. The results from a vulnerability study conducted in two case study communities in Finnish Lapland indicate that both external and internal stresses, combined with the impacts of climate change, force the communities to reconsider their current development paths. The communities are still able to absorb the changes taking place in weather patterns, but the current development paths do not fully support the idea of sustainable adaptation, with its concepts of environmental integrity, social justice and participation. Though several adaptation strategies are deployed, future vulnerability may increase due to ineffective adaptation mechanisms and the increasing role of nature in tourism development.

AB  - This paper investigates how tourists and guides perform sustainability during adventure tourism trips in natural environments. The paper draws on empirical data from an ethnographic study of five different multi-day trips in Norway, each of which used skiing, hiking, or biking as the mode of travel. In our analysis, we focus on how the different actors understood, operationalized and practiced elements of sustainability in their everyday lives while on the trips. The paper applies a micro-sociological perspective to the nature-based adventure tourism scene where the interplay between tourists, guides, adventure activities and nature is understood as multiple dialectic performances co-produced by the different actors. Goffman's dramaturgical metaphors, and concepts of frames, appearance, and manner saturate recent research on tourism and nature guiding. This paper builds on the "performance turn" as a theoretical point of departure for understanding sustainability in nature-based adventure tourism experiences. In participant observations and post-trip interviews with Norwegian and international tourists and their guides, we found that sustainability performances were not a major aspect of the trips. We did find some performances of mainly "light" sustainability and, among them, elements of ambivalence and ambiguity. Our data indicate that some guides tread a fine line between enhancing and deepening tourists' experiences of nature and sustainability or negatively impacting the perceived enjoyment imperative of the trip. International tourists expressed deeper sustainability overall. We reflect on the relative explanatory strengths of Goffman's "frames" and interaction order, and Persson's "framing," for understanding the interplay between guide and tourist sustainability performances and conclude with pointers for teasing out the complexities we identify.

KW  - PORTFOLIO
AB  - Purpose - Typically, organizations tumble with project management, and failure rates are high. Usually, one key factor in establishing a manageable and successful project portfolio is to take into account interdependencies between different projects (resources, technology and market). With an increasing amount of international cross-border project activity, it is vital to know how different countries manage interdependencies, and how management practices differ between countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research bases its empirical findings on a large-scale questionnaire completed during 2007-2008 in Estonia and Finland. Altogether, 288 responses were gained, and roughly two-thirds of the answers originated from Finland and one-thirds from Estonia. Respondents were industrial and service companies.
   Findings - The results of the survey indicate similarities and some significant differences between Estonian and Finnish responses. Some country size and context-dependent hypotheses were not supported or only weakly supported, indicating great homogeneity between managerial issues of interdependency internationally. However, existing significant differences may stem from historical and cultural reasons, such as, peculiarities of transition country compared to mature country.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitation arises from the analyzed sample, which was mostly limited to information and communication technologies, engineering, machinery and construction industries and thus the findings may not be directly applicable to other industries. Because responses originate only from two Finno-Ugrian countries, this limits the generalizability of the research results directly into other regions and countries.
   Practical implications - Managing interdependencies between projects has a clear practical significance, and it appears in companies in both of the countries in the form of bringing additional value, saving costs and in increasing the success rate of projects. In addition, international project owners can find differences in their daily work.
   Originality/value - This research provides empirical evidence for the less investigated, but emerging field of interdependency phenomenon of project management. To the authors' knowledge, no research to date concerns cross-country comparison.

AB  - Traditional measurements of tourism's economic impact refer to primary and secondary effects that are typically quantified through input-output (IO) methodology. From a sustainable regional development perspective, however, economic impact analyses are criticised for their one-dimensional analysis focussing mainly on growth-oriented effects represented by aggregates for output, employment, income or tax. Although existing literature comprises various extensions of IO models, the focus of these models is restricted to indicators at a high aggregate level. Thus, distributional or other socio-economically important aspects related to the tourism workforce are seldom discussed. In our approach to study tourism's impacts over a nine-year period, we consider macro-and meso-level perspectives and disaggregate tourism's impact on regional employment and income for particular occupational areas in the Swedish region of Jamtland. Results indicate weakening employment effects; relatively low but increasing income-inequalities; and increasing shares of elementary positions with precarious working conditions despite para-industrial initiatives from tourism institutions to develop the industry. By enhancing traditional tourism economic impact methodology, we hope that our approach is supportive in putting the tourism workforce at the heart of the regional development and tourism sustainability discourse.

AB  - This article provides insights for attracting short-haul visitors to cultural heritage festivals. We show how a set of experience dimensions work as value drivers to enhance a cultural heritage experience. Drawing on the experience literature we use structural equation modeling to test the relationships between attitude, memory, and revisit intentions. Empirical data were collected from short-haul visitors (from Scandinavia, Europe, and UK) at five Norwegian Viking festivals. Through an integrative framework we examine how appraisals of the experience are impacted by (1) identification with a festival theme, (2) entertainment value, (3) storytelling, and (4) per-sonal interest. Key findings: attendee perceptions of experience dimensions have a positive influ-ence upon their attitudes, memories, and revisit intentions; the formation of good and abundant memories strengthens the attitude-loyalty relationship; self-identification with heritage theme strengthens revisit intentions. The findings are timely as global emergencies increase the appeal of short-haul tourism.

AB  - The first aim of the present study was to investigate the applicability of the two-factor structure (perceptual-motor skills by 11 items, e.g., "fluent driving"; safety skills by 9 items, e.g., "conforming to the speed limits") of the Driver Skill Inventory (DST) among British, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Iranian, and Turkish drivers. It was also hypothesized that the combination of self reported high ratings of perceptual-motor skills and low ratings of safety skills creates a serious risk for dangerous driving and road accident involvement. The second aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate this asymmetric relationship between perceptual-motor and safety skills in traffic penalties and accident involvement. Two hundred and forty two drivers were chosen from each of the six countries, matched for age and sex. The results of exploratory factor analyses together with target rotation showed that the two-factor structure of DST found in "safe" Northern and Western European countries were highly congruent. However, the safety skills factor of DST in Greece, Iran, and Turkey was relatively incongruent in spite of high factor similarity found in perceptual-motor skills. The asymmetric relationship between perceptual-motor and safety skills on traffic penalties was found in Finland and Turkey. A negative relationship between safety skills and the number of accidents was found both in Greece and Iran while a positive relationship between perceptual-motor skills and the number of accidents was found only in Iran.

AB  - Lake Mallusjarvi in the cultural landscape of Mallusjoki, southern Finland, suffers from algal blooms during summers and oxygen depletions during winters due to increased nutrient input resulting from extensive agricultural activities in the catchment. In this study, a sediment profile from the lake was studied using fossil midge (Diptera: Nematocera) analysis and a hypolimnetic oxygen transfer function was applied to establish baseline conditions of hypolimnetic oxygen. In addition, physical properties of the sediment were determined. The inferred late winter hypolimnetic oxygen content was elevated in the beginning of the sediment sequence, but decreased dramatically at ca. 200 cal BP, as the inferred values indicated frequently anoxic condition coinciding with increased agricultural use in the catchment. The results indicated that dramatic changes have occurred in the taxon composition. The high-oxygen Stempellina-Ablabesmyia monilis-type community first changed to moderate-oxygen Procladius-Stempellinella community, and finally to low-oxygen Microchironomus tener-Chironomus plumosus-type community, following the eutrophication process. These changes in macrobenthic faunal assemblages reproduced considerably higher inferred hypolimnetic oxygen reference condition values for hypolimnetic oxygen, compared to the present status.

AB  - The native, European, crayfish fauna belong to a single family, Astacidae, with two genera and five recognized species: Astacus astacus, Astacus leptodactylus, Astacus pachypus, Austropotamobius pallipes, and Austropotamobius torrentium. Habitat degradation and loss, overfishing and the crayfish plague fungus, Aphanomyces astaci Schikora, dramatically reduced and/or eliminated many populations of these crayfish. Several North American crayfish species were intentionally introduced into Europe: Two cambarids, Orconectes limosus was introduced in 1890s, and Procambarus clarkii in the 1970s, and one astacid, Pacifastacus leniusculus, in 1960s. Several Australian parastacid species, genus Cherax, have been or are being cultivated on a minor scale in Europe. Orconectes limosus stock in Europe was established by a successful stocking of 100 specimens from the Delaware River, Pennsylvania, USA, in a fish pond in Barnowko village, Germany. The first 60 P. leniusculus originated from California and were stocked in Sweden, initially for ecological studies of the species. In 1967-1969, great numbers of P. leniusculus were stocked in natural waterbodies in Finland and Sweden. Secondary introductions were later made with the Swedish signal crayfish to many countries in central Europe. P. clarkii was first introduced in 1973 from Louisiana to Spain with fewer that 40,000 individuals but has then spread through secondary introductions to many other south and central European countries. These introductions were often the result of modest numbers of crayfish imported live for food sales or pets. Successful stockings with alien crayfish have led to the situation that crayfish capable of resisting and carrying fungus plague are now permanently found in many of the waters that previously were inhabited by native crayfish. Alien crayfish, however, serve as food for many other animals and are of commercial value for man.

AB  - Inland waters transport large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial environments to the oceans, but DOM also reacts en route, with substantial water column losses by mineralization and sedimentation. For DOM transformations along the aquatic continuum, lakes play an important role as they retain waters in the landscape allowing for more time to alter DOM. We know DOM losses are significant at the global scale, yet little is known about how the reactivity of DOM varies across landscapes and climates. DOM reactivity is inherently linked to its chemical composition. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to explore DOM quality from 560 lakes distributed across Sweden and encompassed a wide climatic gradient typical of the boreal ecozone. Six fluorescence components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The intensity and relative abundance of these components were analyzed in relation to lake chemistry, catchment, and climate characteristics. Land cover, particularly the percentage of water in the catchment, was a primary factor explaining variability in PARAFAC components. Likewise, lake water retention time influenced DOM quality. These results suggest that processes occurring in upstream water bodies, in addition to the lake itself, have a dominant influence on DOM quality. PARAFAC components with longer emission wavelengths, or red-shifted components, were most reactive. In contrast, protein-like components were most persistent within lakes. Generalized characteristics of PARAFAC components based on emission wavelength could ease future interpretation of fluorescence spectra. An important secondary influence on DOM quality was mean annual temperature, which ranged between -6.2 and +7.5 degrees C. These results suggest that DOM reactivity depends more heavily on the duration of time taken to pass through the landscape, rather than temperature. Projected increases in runoff in the boreal region may force lake DOM toward a higher overall amount and proportion of humic-like substances.

AB  - In eight European study sites (in Spain, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Estonia and Sweden), abundance of breeding farmland bird territories was obtained from 500 x 500 m survey plots (30 per area, N = 240) using the mapping method. Two analyses were performed: (I) a Canonical Correspondence Analysis of species abundance in relation to geographical location and variables measuring agricultural intensification at field and farm level to identify significant intensification variables and to estimate the fractions of total variance in bird abundance explained by geography and agricultural intensification; (II) several taxonomic and functional community indices were built and analysed using GLM in relation to the intensification variables found significant in the CCA. The geographical location of study sites alone explains nearly one fifth (19.5%) of total variation in species abundance. The fraction of variance explained by agricultural intensification alone is much smaller (4.3%), although significant. The intersection explains nearly two fifths (37.8%) of variance in species abundance. Community indices are negatively affected by correlates of intensification like farm size and yield, whereas correlates of habitat availability and quality have positive effects on taxonomic and functional diversity of assemblages. Most of the purely geographical variation in farmland bird assemblage composition is associated to Mediterranean steppe species, reflecting the bio-geographical singularity of that assemblage and reinforcing the need to preserve this community. Taxonomic and functional diversity of farmland bird communities are negatively affected by agricultural intensification and positively affected by increasing farmland habitat availability and quality.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to present the Swedish Vision Zero Experience concerning separating car traffic with cable barriers and upgrading traffic safety on existing 13 m roads using low cost measures.
   There is a significant difference in traffic performance, safety, investment and maintenance costs, land requirement and intrusion between normal two-lane and four-lane cross-sections. In Sweden, this gap has been narrowed with a 13 m road with 3.75 m traffic lanes and 2.75 m hard shoulders. The traffic performance of these roads is quite satisfactory but there are safety problems with fatal accidents.
   The main problem on all two-lane roads is run-off road and head-on accidents causing more than 66% of all fatalities. The event process tends to be the same. The driver loses control for some reason and crashes against some obstacle in the roadside area or opposing vehicle.
   In 1998, the Director General of SNRA decided on a full-scale programme to improve traffic safety on six existing 13 m roads using low-cost measures, preferably within the existing right-of-way. The main alternative is the 2+1 solution with a separating cable barrier, preferably within the existing 13 m width. This solution was estimated to have a potential to prevent some 50% of all severe link accidents. Findings so far have been so successful that SNRA has decided to generally replace the old 13 m roads with the 2+1 solution.
   The main results and findings up to May 2001 are as follows:
   Level-of-service for normal traffic is better than expected. Speed performance on 2+1 roads with cable barrier is the same, or even better than an ordinary semi-motorway at one directional flows up to 1400 v/h. The capacity is estimated to be about 1 650 v/h in one direction, some 300 v/h less than for an ordinary 13 m road.
   Emergency and tow agencies are complaining as their workload have increased.
   The transition zones from 2 to I lane have performed well. The proportion of vehicles in the beginning of the zone is small. Drivers tend handle the design of the transition zones in a cautious and responsible manner.
   The traffic safety effect on severe accidents was expected to be high on 2+1 road with cable barrier. So far in eight objects total length there has not been any fatal and only 6 persons with severe injuries. This is about 60% less than on ordinary semi-motorways and supports the prediction that fatal and severe injuries can be reduced with up to 50%.
   Median cable barrier crashes are very frequent but normally without person injuries. They are often caused by skidding, flat tire or loss of control. A number of possible severe accidents have been converted by means of the median cable barrier to crashes with slight or no injuries.
   Driver attitude surveys show that drivers attitude to roads with cable barrier have been changed in a positive direction. About 40% of the drivers say it is the best design. General survey shows that about 76% say that they want all major roads to have median barrier.
   The maintenance costs are increased with about 120 Thousand SEK (12000 USD) per km per year. The main costs are cable repairs with 80 Thousand SEK (8000 USD) per km per year. Work zone safety at cable barrier repairs is a major concern.
   give an overview of the SNRA development program to upgrade traffic safety on existing 13 in two lane roads with 2 + 1 conversion with median cable barrier as the main tool
   present an overview of all important results and empirical findings until April 2001 from opened projects as yet, totally some 365 kin (2001).

AB  - In patchy habitats, the relationship between animal abundance and cover of a preferred habitat may change with the availability of that habitat, resulting in a functional response in habitat use. Here, we investigate the relationship of two specialized herbivores, willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and mountain hare (Lepus timidus), to willows (Salix spp.) in three regions of the shrub tundra zone-northern Norway, northern European Russia and western Siberia. Shrub tundra is a naturally patchy habitat where willow thickets represent a major structural element and are important for herbivores both as food and shelter. Habitat use was quantified using feces counts in a hierarchical spatial design and related to several measures of willow thicket configuration. We document a functional response in the use of willow thickets by ptarmigan, but not by hares. For hares, whose range extends into forested regions, occurrence increased overall with willow cover. The occurrence of willow ptarmigan showed a strong positive relationship to willow cover and a negative relationship to thicket fragmentation in the region with lowest willow cover at landscape scale, where willow growth may be limited by reindeer browsing. In regions with higher cover, in contrast, such relationships were not observed. Differences in predator communities among the regions may contribute to the observed pattern, enhancing the need for cover where willow thickets are scarce. Such region-specific relationships reflecting regional characteristics of the ecosystem highlight the importance of large-scale investigations to understand the relationships of habitat availability and use, which is a critical issue considering that habitat availability changes quickly with climate change and human impact.

AB  - In a previous study on integrating minority groups in Ostrobothnia in 2019, one of the most influential challenges was not including native Finns in the integration process. This finding was made using the structured democratic dialogue (SDD). For the present study, the same participatory methodology was applied, wherein 12 participants from diverse socio-economical, cultural, and educational background who reside in Ostrobothnia were brought together to explore feasible action plans to facilitate the inclusion of Finns in the integration process in the city of Vaasa in this region of Finland. The participants generated 66 action plans categorized under eight clusters. Based on the influence map generated by participants, Action #62 stated that the most influential one was "All projects are inclusive". Action #55 stated, "Balanced representation of all the people (Finns, minorities and foreigners) in the political parties" and Action #49 stated, "Social-emotional education curriculum" were perceived as having great influence on other actions. Thus, drawing from the results of this SDD Co-Lab, these action plans should be considered priorities in order to successfully include Finns in the integration process. The low number of participants and the narrow representation of some minority groups are limitations of this study.

AB  - Sustainable sanitation and food security have been issues in all human history although named differently. This study describes the evolution of sanitation arrangements in the Swedish town Linkoping for the period 1870-2000. The flow of phosphorus from food consumption is estimated for the period and its output is divided into gainful reuse in agriculture and energy production and (harmful) losses to the hydrosphere and landfills. The rate of gainful reuse varies dramatically, from very high, up until the 1920s, followed by a drop to almost zero around 1950. Reuse was picking up since the introduction of a phosphorus removal unit at wastewater treatment plants and application of sludge in agriculture from the 1970s, but was followed by a sharp decline at the end of the 20th century. The results from Linkoping are applied to scenarios for Sweden as a whole and extended to some anticipated implications for the world in the years to come.

AB  - Fifteen large (> 20 kg) snowpack samples, representing the atmospheric deposition of one winter (1995/1996), were collected in the vicinity (1.5-8 km) of the copper-nickel processing plants on the Kola Peninsula, NW Russia. Microscopical (reflected light) and electron microprobe investigations were carried out on polished sections of filter residues (> 0.45 mu m) of these samples to identify the mineralogical composition of the particulate deposition. The technique allows us to directly distinguish between particles originating from geogenic sources (e.g. windblown rock dust) and additional anthropogenic input from industrial sources. Furthermore, it was possible to gain information on the metallurgical processes used in the different factories (one roasting plant and two smelters using different technology). Each industry emits a very characteristic spectrum of particulates. The mineralogy of the particulate inpute can thus be directly used to unravel the source of observed heavy metal inputs at any one place even in complex situations with several industries located at close distance.

AB  - Setting relevant temporal baselines is critical to understanding biodiversity change and the full impact of various pressures on biodiversity. Current knowledge of biodiversity change in European boreal waterbird communities is based on monitoring and other data from the last 35 years. However, the impact of the presumed main drivers of changes in these communities, i.e., eutrophication and alien predators, started decades before this. We used data of 35 breeding waterbird communities, representing both oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes, in southern Finland from 1951-1970 and 1996-2015 to study changes in biodiversity against a baseline from a period when the presumed main drivers were not yet fully effective. We found that species richness increased from 1951-1970 to 1996-2015 at oligotrophic lakes but not at eutrophic lakes; total abundance in turn increased at the former lake type but decreased at the latter. Breeding numbers of many historically abundant species declined at the eutrophic lakes to such a degree that the increases of other species were not sufficient to compensate for the declines. Population increases prevailed at the oligotrophic lakes and the slight declines of some previously less abundant species, were compensated for. The species level results revealed that local abundances of different species likely are affected by different drivers, suggesting that we need an autecological approach in the conservation management of boreal waterbird communities. Increased predation risk rather than eutrophication appeared to be the main biodiversity stressor in the waterbird communities studied.

AB  - A generalized vulnerability framework was used to structure an interdisciplinary and intercultural examination of factors that influence the ways in which reindeer pastoralism in Finnmark (northern Norway) may be affected by climate change. Regional and local (downscaled) climate projections included scenarios that can potentially influence foraging conditions for reindeer. None of the projections were without precedent; several climate change events in Finnmark during the last 100 years were at least as great as those projected in the next 20-30 years. Herders' traditional responses to changes in both the natural and the socio-economic environments have depended on a flexibility in herding practice that is currently being eroded by several non-climate factors. The reduced of freedom of action resulting from loss of habitat, predation and aspects of governance (especially economic and legal constraints) potentially dwarves the putative effects of projected climate change on reindeer pastoralism. It may, however, also lead to situations in which new climatic conditions threaten the system in unprecedented ways. Developing appropriate methodologies for assessing the adaptive capacity, the vulnerability and the resilience of social-ecological systems to global changes remains a challenge. Recognition of the knowledge systems of Arctic cultures and the full engagement of local people throughout the process are key elements of the solution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of hydrological processes and water balance elements are important for climate adaptive water management as well as for introducing mitigation measures aiming to improve surface water quality. Mathematical models have the potential to estimate changes in hydrological processes under changing climatic or land use conditions. These models, indeed, need careful calibration and testing before being applied in decision making. The aim of this study was to compare the capability of five different hydrological models to predict the runoff and the soil water balance elements of a small catchment in Norway. The models were harmonised and calibrated against the same data set. In overall, a good agreement between the measured and simulated runoff was obtained for the different models when integrating the results over a week or longer periods. Model simulations indicate that forest appears to be very important for the water balance in the catchment, and that there is a lack of information on land use specific water balance elements. We concluded that joint application of hydrological models serves as a good background for ensemble modelling of water transport processes within a catchment and can highlight the uncertainty of models forecast.

AB  - Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to demonstrate the value of common general health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments, readily available for cross-cultural comparisons, in persons with spinal cord lesion (SCL) treated at spinal units in Melbourne, Australia and in Gothenburg, Sweden. Another aim was to determine as to which of the independent variables were the most powerful predictors of global QL in the two SCL groups.
   Settings: Australia and Sweden.
   Methods: Two groups consisting of 89 Australian and 71 Swedish SCL persons were surveyed. The two groups were matched according to sex, age, time since injury and level of injury. The 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) and the Spinal Cord Injuries Quality of Life-23-item questionnaire were used to cover essential generic and specific domains of health and quality of life. Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected using questionnaires. For interpretation purpose, available general population data were used.
   Results: The most important predictors of QL perception in the Australian group were the same as for the Swedish group; mood, physical and social functioning and problems regarding injury. In total, 61% (Australian group) and 52% (Swedish group) of the variance was explained by these variables. Despite similarities of health profiles, some areas of the SF-36 differed between the two groups.
   Conclusion: The demonstrated HRQL profiles in SCL persons have shown that valid measures can provide new information of clinical value beyond the self-evident physical and practical restrictions due to injury. Illustrative comparisons, such as those presented here between Australia and Sweden, may extend our knowledge about areas where the SCL persons themselves are the logical experts, for example, maintenance of personal roles, social interaction and emotional well-being.

AB  - Mining of sulfide-rich pyritic ores produces acid mine drainage waters and has induced major ecological problems in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Biomining utilizes microbes to extract metals from the ore, and it has been suggested as a new sustainable way to produce metals. However, little is known of the potential ecotoxicological effects of biomining. In the present study, biomining impacts were assessed using survival and behavioral responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates at in situ exposures in streams. The authors used an impedance conversion technique to measure quantitatively in situ behavioral responses of larvae of the regionally common mayfly, Heptagenia dalecarlica, to discharges from the Talvivaara mine (Sotkamo, Northern Finland), which uses a biomining technique. Behavioral responses measured in 3 mine-impacted streams were compared with those measured in 3 reference streams. In addition, 3-d survival of the mayfly larvae and the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in the study sites. Biomining impacts on stream water quality included increased concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and metals, especially manganese, cadmium, zinc, sodium, and calcium. Survival of the invertebrates in the short term was not affected by the mine effluents. In contrast, apparent behavioral changes in mayfly larvae were detected, but these responses were not consistent among sites, which may reflect differing natural water chemistry of the study sites.

AB  - A peat core from a mire with poor fen lawns and ombrotrophic hummock strings in Northern Sweden was examined (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition) to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on the plant species composition and peat accumulation of the peat forming vegetation during the last 1700 yr. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. The Lappmyran region was dominated by Pinus and Picea forest. Changes in land-use patterns and population density were visible in the pollen record of the regional vegetation. Juniperus and Rumex acetosa-type pollen indicated the presence of grazed land in the area between AD 1500 and 1950. The vegetation at the coring spot gradually became ombrotrophic. The local plant and testate amoebae compositions reflect changes in surface wetness caused by changes in precipitation and the internal dynamics of the bog. A wet interval was observed during the Maunder minimum of solar activity. The presence of Drepanocladus fluitans indicates less ombrotrophic conditions during this period probably caused by the inflow of minerogenic water from upslope owing to increased precipitation. The reconstructed water table shows agreement with precipitation measurements which were available since AD 1860. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Children's happiness is an important issue that needs to be addressed around the world; however, limited research has explored how children define happiness. In this study, we conducted a survey of elementary school children living in different countries and clarified the contextual definitions of happiness by a total of 842 children (Mean age = 11.01,SD = 1.05, effective rate = 97.34%) from Grades 4 to 6 living in Japan (n = 474), Mongolia (n = 121), and Finland (n = 247). We investigated the definition of children's happiness using the stimulus sentence completion test. For Mongolian children, happiness was predominantly characterized by references to family relationships. For Finnish children, happiness appeared to be linked to autonomous involvement with things, personal achievement, and success. Furthermore, the happiness of Japanese children was largely characterized by pleasant versus unpleasant experiences. In addition, Japanese children often referred to "being scolded" and their happiness was not related to school success. Our findings concurred with the elements of Seligman's (2012) concept of flourishing as a new criterion for judging well-being. It was also suggested that the dominant elements of happiness may differ depending on an individual's country and culture.

AB  - Climate change is expected to drive the distribution retraction of northern species. However, particularly in regions with a history of intensive exploitation, changes in habitat management could facilitate distribution expansions counter to expectations under climate change. Here, we test the potential for future forest management to facilitate the southward expansion of an old-forest species from the boreal region into the boreo-nemoral region, contrary to expectations under climate change. We used an ensemble of species distribution models based on citizen science data to project the response of Phellinus ferrugineofuscus, a redlisted old-growth indicator, wood-decaying fungus, to six forest management and climate change scenarios. We projected change in habitat suitability across the boreal and boreonemoral regions of Sweden for the period 2020-2100. Scenarios varied in the proportion of forest set aside from production, the level of timber extraction, and the magnitude of climate change. Habitat suitabilities for the study species were projected to show larger relative increases over time in the boreo-nemoral region compared to the boreal region, under all scenarios. By 2100, mean suitabilities in set-aside forest in the boreo-nemoral region were similar to the suitabilities projected for set-aside forest in the boreal region in 2020, suggesting that occurrence in the boreo-nemoral region could be increased. However, across all scenarios, consistently higher projected suitabilities in set-aside forest in the boreal region indicated that the boreal region remained the species stronghold. Furthermore, negative effects of climate change were evident in the boreal region, and projections suggested that climatic changes may eventually counteract the positive effects of forest management in the boreo-nemoral region. Our results suggest that the current rarity of this old-growth indicator species in the boreo-nemoral region may be due to the history of intensive forestry. Forest management therefore has the potential to compensate for the negative effects of climate change. However, increased occurrence at the southern range edge would depend on the dispersal and colonization ability of the species. An increase in the amount of set-aside forest across both the boreal and boreonemoral regions is therefore likely to be required to prevent the decline of old-forest species under climate change.

TI  - The Outlaw and No-Man's Land: The International Circulation of Visual Repertoires in World War I
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This paper proposes a reevaluation of the relationship between Swedish feature films and World War I during the years 1914-18, suggesting that a widespread visual repertoire of war imagery circulating in Europe and Sweden through the illustrated weeklies and cinema newsreels created a production and exhibition context in which various visual tropes from the war formed a baseline, taken-for-granted cultural framework for the meaning of Swedish films, even though Sweden was not directly involved in the conflict. The paper chooses as its main case study Victor Sjostrom's 1917 film Berg Eyvind och hans hustru in order to suggest ways in which the film's insistent verticality and location shooting in the wilds of Northern Sweden was in dialogue with the pervasive wartime visual repertoire of trench warfare and no-man's land. Furthermore, when the film was exhibited in Germany and France after the war, the strong affective response of continental critics to the "primitive" natural landscapes can also be read in the context of a new imagination of landscapes that were devastated by and subjugated to technology, which was the constantly reinforced message of the circulating visual repertoire of the war.

AB  - Frogs are often rare or absent from intensively farmed areas. Here we explore the possibility that the landscape and the quality of the terrestrial habitat are unsuitable for these populations. Spawn of Rana arvalis and R. temporaria was introduced into ponds in a south Swedish agricultural landscape in 2003 (eight ponds) and 2004 (ten ponds). Metamorphs emerged front nine (R. a.) and 12 (R. t.) of these. In years following the introduction, spawn was found in five (R. a.) and eight (R. t.) of these 18 ponds. The number of spawn clumps peaked two years after the introduction. Three or four years after the introduction, breeding persisted in only two of the ponds (where both species were breeding). One year later also these populations had also become extinct. In control ponds (ponds within 750 in of the introduction ponds), spawn of R. temporaria was occasionally found but there was no trend, nor any temporal peak in frequency or quantity of spawn in these ponds. There were calling males of both species already one year after the introduction at a few ponds, indicating an unusually early maturation for sonic individuals. We suggest that the terrestrial habitat ill this region is not suitable for the continued presence of populations of R. arvalis and R. temporaria. This may be related to the habitat per se or to the isolation of the populations. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009

AB  - Urban experiments, living labs and testbeds have emerged as influential approaches to governing cities around the world. Experimental governance allows stakeholders to trial possible futures and to embrace creativity and innovation in the pursuit of sustainability goals. Experiments are often conducted through triple helix partnerships that favour informal and distributed actions. This is a significant departure from traditional urban development processes that are informed by well-defined processes executed by public authorities to ensure the public good and are legitimated by citizens. In this paper, we investigate this tension between experimental governance and public sector legitimacy by focusing on experimental practices in two Swedish municipalities, Stockholm and Gothenburg. We gathered data through a desk-based study, participant observations and semi-structured interviews with municipal actors to investigate the input, throughput and output legitimacy of municipalities in experimental governance. The findings indicate that municipalities emphasise actions and results from experiments, while de-emphasising reflection and attention to democratic procedures and protection of the public good. The focus on legitimacy reveals the fragmented and instrumental practices of experimental governance and a deficit in organizational capacity with potential detrimental impacts on legitimacy.

AB  - Climate change continues to pose a threat to the sustainability of water resources. Global warming can have several effects on the water resources and water demands in the Densu River Basin especially household water use and agriculture use among several others. However, the extents to which the hydrology of the Densu River Basin is will be altered in the future remains unknown. In this research, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP21) system was used to study the impacts of future climate change on water resources in the Densu River Basin. Future climate data (rainfall and temperature) for the period 2051-2080 was generated from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute's climate models (ICHEC-EC-EARTH and RCA4) for RCP4.5 scenario under CORDEX experiment. The results of the study indicate that the Densu River Basin will experience a temperature increase by 8.23% and a 17% reduction in rainfall resulting in 58.3% reduction in water resources in the area. The climate change impact analysis indicates a reduction in the river streamflow due to decrease in rainfall. It is recommended that future research on climate change adaptation for water management in the Densu River Basin should be conducted.

AB  - Today's benthic offshore biological monitoring of oil & gas (O&G) activities relies on macrofauna taxa enumeration. For the future, analysis of DNA isolated directly from sediments holds great potential for multi-trophic biodiversity surveys and the monitoring of a larger spectrum of benthic taxa, including micro-fauna. Here, we evaluate more specifically the potential of microfauna-specific gene quantification in relation to both petroleum-related discharge compounds and other seafloor environmental properties. We carried out this evaluation using sediment samples collected at drilling Region III on the Norwegian continental shelf where DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic diversity was already performed. Generally, the quantification of microfauna indicator taxa related well to the gradient of contamination on the seafloor. Contrary to eukaryotic Euplotida, metabarcoding data and qPCR numbers for indicative prokaryotic taxa showed the same relationship to offshore contaminants (both showed positive relationship). We found absolute numbers of SSU rRNA gene copies of (1) Dinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Alcanivorax were correlated with the level of petroleum-related compounds but not with other environmental variables, (2) bacteria closely related to Shewanella were correlated with the concentration of Ba, PAH, as well to percent of gravel, (3) Desulfobacteriales correlated with petroleum-related contaminants, but as well with percent of gravel and grain size.
   Findings from our study suggest that biomonitoring surveys of O&G activities on benthos could benefit from quantification of specific micro-fauna indicators that is simpler and faster than the methods currently used for impact assessment of benthos.

AB  - This paper uses the 2014-2015 plunge in oil prices as a linchpin for understanding how petroleum development represents a challenge to Arctic societies. Analysis of media discourses, grey literature and fieldwork material from 2013 to 2017 compared with previous work in the region shows that the 75% price decrease in oil price brings into stark relief the perceived level of ontological security that future petroleum economies in Northern Norway, Alaska and Greenland provides. The findings reveal that while the communities in each location find themselves along different timelines of the petroleum economy, there are transferable insights that can benefit other communities influenced by (the potential for) petroleum development in both the Arctic and beyond, in particular concerning the way in which specific ideas about oil and oils future features as contributing to or diminishes ontological security perceptions on the ground. The goal of this paper is to deepen the comparative analysis of research on tensions in Arctic communities as petroleum is perceived as either strengthening or threatening future ontological security in the region. The discussion considers the consequences of path dependent petroleum economies, and how perceptions on alternative futures can fruitfully be introduced into petroleum-dominated narratives about viable Arctic futures.

AB  - Archival data, survey and interviews were used to invest ate mediation activities among judges in the Norwegian Land Consolidation Court. The court handles land issue disputes among farmers in rural Norway. Despite having both planning skill and court power the judges spend a considerable amount of time mediating the disputes. In fairly integrative planning disputes they increase their mediation efforts with conflict level, case size and complexity. Mediation helped to reduce objections to the plan implemented. In more distributive boundary disputes they mediated less, and to a lesser degree varied efforts with case characteristics. However, settlements were achieved in the less conflictive, smaller and less complex cases. Considerable variations in mediation soles were found among the judges. Those with settlement oriented behaviour achieved more settlements than those that focused on facilitating communication. Implications are discussed.

AB  - In transitioning to a renewable material-based bio economy, growing public and industry interest is apparent for using wooden multistory construction (WMC) as a sustainable urban housing solution in Europe, but its business implications are not well understood. In our study, we evaluate, which internal and external factors of competitiveness are shaping the future of WMC, especially in the context of Finland and Sweden. Based on a multi-level perspective of socio-technical transitions, we conducted a three-stage dissensus-based Delphi study. The identified internal and external factors affecting the future competitiveness of the WMC business emphasize the importance of skilled architects and builders and the role of standardized building systems. Based on our results, the key aspects influencing the future competitiveness of WMC in the region are related to the development of technical infrastructure and project-based business networks, while additional changes in regulatory framework are perceived as less important. We conclude that towards 2030, the strong cognitive rules founded in the concrete-based building culture in these countries is likely to inhibit the dynamics of the socio-technical regime level. A change is also needed in the WMC business culture towards more open cross-sectoral collaboration and new business networks between different-sized players.

AB  - To investigate the importance of benthic vegetation for shallow infaunal assemblages, macroinvertebrates were sampled in Zostera marina meadows and in adjacent bare sand at three sites in the Skagerrak region and one in the Western part of Norway. A total of 3777 individuals were encountered, representing mainly the faunal groups Annelida, Nemertea, Echinodermata, Crustacea and Mollusca. Twice as many individuals were found in the Z. marina meadows compared to the bare sand. Oligochaetes were the most abundant group (29% of total number of individuals), followed by crustaceans (24%), polychaetes (18.5%) and molluscs (16%). Polychaetes showed the highest species number (42), followed by molluscs (30) and crustaceans (26). Multivariate cluster technique showed the highest similarities within sites and thereafter grouping according to the two different habitats; Zostera and sand. No regional differences were evident between the Skagerrak sites and the site in Western Norway, as the site from Western Norway grouped together with one of the Skagerrak sites. The high biodiversity in Zostera marina beds should have implications for the management of such areas.

AB  - This article critically examines the governing of sustainable urban development' through self-build cohousing groups in Gothenburg and Hamburg. The two case cities have been selected because both are currently involved in major urban restructuring, and have launched programmes to support self-build groups and cohousing as part of their emphasis on promoting urban sustainable development through this process. Departing from a theoretical discussion on advanced liberal urban governance, focusing in particular on the contemporary discourse on sustainable urban development, we examine the interaction between political institutions, civil society and private actors in the construction of cohousing as a perceived novel and alternative form of housing that may contribute to fulfilling certain sustainability goals. Questions centre on the socio-political contextualization of cohousing; concepts of sustainability; strategies of, and relations between, different actors in promoting cohousing; gentrification and segregation; and inclusion and exclusion. In conclusion we argue that, while self-build groups can provide pockets of cohousing as an alternative to dominant forms of housing, the economic and political logics of advanced liberal urban development make even such a modest target difficult, particularly when it comes to making such housing affordable.

AB  - With biodiversity facing threats, there is a need to improve reserve selection procedures. However, detailed information about different biodiversity measures (e.g. species richness) at potential sites is often lacking, and selecting areas that protect most biodiversity is difficult. To simplify matters, biodiversity surrogate species, that is, species associated with higher biodiversity than average, have been used for area selection. However, consensus about the performance of the surrogate species concept is lacking, and there are few studies investigating potential differences in the effectiveness of multiple predators as surrogates for biodiversity over large spatial scales. We evaluated two avian predators, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and the Ural owl Strix uralensis, as surrogates for biodiversity in the boreal forest biome in Western Finland. We used a study design including nest sites and two reference sites for each nest, the diversity of birds and wood-decaying fungi (polypores). We assessed simultaneously whether surrogacy persisted at the landscape level while moving from one vegetation zone to another. We generally found more birds and polypores around the nest sites for both goshawks and Ural owls than at their respective reference sites. However, the goshawk outperformed the Ural owl. Additionally, although biodiversity was found to decrease at the landscape scale as a result of a decrease in vegetation complexity with increasing longitude, the surrogacy efficiency of the raptors remained unchanged. Synthesis and applications. These findings suggest that the surrogate species concept applied to raptors may be an efficient addition to methods for identifying areas of conservation priority, even across vegetation zones. We conclude that protecting areas around raptor nests is a method to consider in order to halt forest biodiversity loss. Finally, sampling biodiversity along diversity and landscape gradients can improve the necessary assessment of surrogate species.

AB  - Designing efficient agri-environmental policies for agricultural nutrient load reductions calls for information on the costs of emission reduction measures. This study develops an empirical framework for estimating abatement costs for nutrient loading from agricultural land. Nitrogen abatement costs and the phosphorus load reductions associated with nitrogen abatement are derived for crop farming in south-western Finland. The model is used to evaluate the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy reform currently underway on nutrient abatement costs. Results indicate that an efficiently designed policy aimed at a 50% reduction in agricultural nitrogen load would cost EURO 48 to EURO 35 million, or EURO 3756 to EURO 2752 per farm.

AB  - Available climate change scenarios indicate that climate change will affect elements of the Swedish climate, and that the exposure and sensitivity of the forest to climate change will differ between regions. Adaptation to climate change is conceptually closely linked to the reduction of the risk of disasters. Based on contemporary theory in behavioural risk research, the aim was to improve the knowledge on the process of adaptation of forest management to climate change among Swedish private individual forest owners. The responses from two questionnaires from 1999 to 2004, respectively, were analysed. Adaptation of forest management to climate change by private individual forest owners in what is currently the hemiboreal bio-climatic zone of Sweden was quantified and shown to increase over the five year period. In 2004 adaptive measures had been taken on a limited fraction of the forest land owned by private individuals in three study areas located along a latitudinal gradient ranging from the nemoral to the boreal bio-climatic zones in Sweden. Adaptive measures were more frequent in two southern study areas than in a northern study area. Measures taken to adapt were similar in all three study areas, except for those strongly conditioned by the current local climate. Among forest owners who had taken measure to adapt, perceptions of much higher risk due to climate change was more frequent for the risk of damage by wind, drought, fungi, and insects than for other risk factors. Further improvement of the knowledge on how the individual forest owners' learn and perceive of climate change, its impacts on risks and options for adaptation is required to develop and successfully implement adaptive climate change policies.

AB  - This article explores work-family interface and the use of mobile technologies (MTs) among male lawyers in Quebec (French Canada) and Finland - two civil law contexts with reputations for legislation friendly toward work-family balance. Drawing on 34 interviews with male lawyers and combining two theoretical lenses, shifting ideals of fatherhood and work-family boundary theory, our study shows how men's preferences for work-family boundary management relate to diversifying models of fatherhood and family. In Finland, male lawyers more readily embrace family responsibilities and they strive to set firm boundaries to curtail work spilling over into family life. Yet, the cultural and professional norm of men as breadwinners remains strong, especially for Canadian male lawyers whose spouses more often assume primary responsibility for childcare. Our study offers qualitative markers of boundary management styles and strategies (spatial, temporal, and psychological) of male professionals - as struggling segmentors, struggling integrators, and integrators. We observe that senior male lawyers, living in more traditional family models, frequently model integrating behaviours, such as around-the-clock availability via MTs. This modeling establishes expectations of what represents a committed professional worthy of promotion. These practices play an important role in sustaining and reproducing gender inequalities in organisations that employ professionals.

AB  - For reasons of aesthetics, sheltering, biodiversity, and children's need of playgrounds, selective coppicing could be a useful and effective silvicultural method in urban areas. A randomised block experiment was carried out in three broad-leaved coppices situated within the fenced area of Arlanda Airport to compare a selective coppice regime (SCR), where: all trees above a certain height limit were cut, with a traditional coppice regime, where all trees were felled. The effects of the treatments of the dominating tree species European aspen (Populus tremula L.) and birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.) were studied. During three growing seasons after performed treatment, the proportion of sprouting stools and root shooting of European aspen were reduced in SCR. Birch stools had fewer sprouts stool(-1), and sprouts of both birch and European aspen tended to be shorter in SCR. There was a tendency that the sprout mortality was lower in SCR for both birch and European aspen. Residual stands of SCR consisted of proportionally less birch, and more rowan, bird cherry, oak and other species. Coppicing with single tree selection from above suppressed light demanding tree species and promoted the more shade-tolerant species compared to traditional coppicing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The article investigates how national and international measures to protect wolves turned the whole of Norway into a field of study for wildlife biologists, and how the extensiveness of this "field" prompted a transformation in the methods employed to count and monitor wolves. As it was not possible to conduct traditional field studies throughout the whole of Norway, the biologists constructed an extensive infrastructure, which I have termed a "counting complex," in order to count wolves from a distance. The article identifies three decisive periods in the construction of this complex: the 1960s, the 1980s, and the first decade of the new millennium. During the first two periods, biologists used the infrastructure to mobilize ordinary people's observations; they did this by first searching through newspaper notes, then enrolling people more directly through local committees of game management. However, the public's observations often turned out to be unreliable, and, in the 2000s, molecular biologists helped to incorporate genetic techniques into the counting complex. By using the infrastructure to mobilize wolf scat, rather than observations, and by constructing DNA profiles for individual wolves, the molecular biologists enabled research that I have termed "nationwide field studies in absentia." The article argues that the biologists' main motive for constructing and refining the counting complex was to make wolves amenable to government, as they considered this a vital premise for the successful practice of protecting wolves. The increased intensity in monitoring in the last period, however, was also driven by international conventions and detailed regulations.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is one of the most eutrophied seas in the world, facing challenges with both hypoxia and algae blooms. In this study we analyse the effect of using different fishery policy instruments to reduce nutrient loads by removing fish biomass from the ecosystem. The study covers Danish, Finnish and Swedish pelagic fisheries. We distinguish between a private optimum maximising the net present value from fishing and a social optimum including the positive externality of removing nutrients. A dynamic bio-economic model, FishRent, is used to estimate the effect of three policy scenarios: Fisheries regulation using individual transferable quotas (ITQ); Economic compensation provided to fishers for reducing nutrients; and Environmental regulation maximising sustainable catches. The results show that the highest social welfare gain is achieved by maximising catch volumes while having a flexible system for quota trade within the fishing sector. The social welfare gain from the positive externality of the extra fish landed in this case outweighs the private loss of not fishing at the optimal individual level (maximum economic yield).

AB  - Aim This study tests the hypothesis that linear, woody habitat patches surrounding small, sunken rural roads not only function as an unstable sink but also as a true, sustainable habitat for forest plants. Furthermore, factors affecting the presence of forest plant species in sunken roads are determined. Finally, the implications of these findings for the overall metapopulation dynamics of forest plant species in fragmented agricultural landscapes are assessed.
   Location The study area, c. 155 km(2) in size, is situated in a fragmented agricultural landscape within the loamy region of central Belgium.
   Methods Forest species presence-absence data were collected for 389 sunken roads. The effect of area, depth, age and isolation on sunken road species richness was assessed using linear regression and analysis of variance (anova). Analysis of covariance was employed to study the interaction between age and isolation. Differences in plant community dispersal spectra in relation to sunken road age and isolation were analysed by means of linear regression and anova.
   Results Sunken roads proved to function as an important habitat for forest plants. The sink-hypothesis was falsified by a clear species accumulation in time: sunken road species richness significantly increased with the age of the elements. Sunken road age mainly affected species richness through effects on both area and depth, affecting habitat quality and diversity. Furthermore, sunken road isolation had a significant impact on species richness as well, with the number of forest species decreasing with increasing isolation of the elements, indicating dispersal limitation in sunken road habitats. Moreover, a significant age x isolation interaction effect was demonstrated. Differences in regression slopes for isolation between age classes revealed that the effect of isolation intensified with increasing age of the elements. Differential colonization in relation to forest species dispersal capacities probably account for this, as confirmed by the analysis of sunken road plant community dispersal spectra, with the fraction of species with low dispersal capacities increasing with increasing age and decreasing isolation of the elements.
   Main conclusions During sunken road development, area and depth increase and, gradually, suitable habitat conditions for forest plant species arise. Depending on their ecological requirements and dispersal capacities, forest species progressively colonize these habitats as a function of the element's isolation. The functioning of sunken roads as a sustainable habitat for forest species enhances the metapopulation viability of forest plants in agricultural landscapes and has important consequences for forest restoration practices. Moreover, the results of this work call for integrating the presence of forest species in small-scaled linear habitat patches in forest fragmentation studies.

AB  - We report the development of ddPCR assays for single and simultaneous detection of the bacterial pathogens Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Yersinia ruckeri in water from land-based recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS), producing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolt. The method was tested and verified for use in water analyses from RAS production sites, and proved to be specific and with sensitivity 0.0011 ng DNA for F. psychrophilum and 1.24 ng for Y. ruckeri. These bacteria are important fish pathogens that have caused reoccurring salmonid infection disease in RAS. Monitoring pathogen levels in water samples could be a useful alternative surveillance strategy to evaluate operational risk assessment connected to stress factors. Water quality is essential for fish health and growth in RAS production in general, and high or increasing levels of these pathogens in the RAS water may generate an early indication of unfavourable conditions in the RAS environment, and give directions to operational actions. This approach may reduce fish mortality, reduce production loss, and offer more effective and targeted preventive measures within RAS production.

AB  - The article examines high-technology development networks in peripheral areas using the case of Northern Finland (as defined by the EU under its Structural Funds programme). Few material and social resources and long distances between key development actors are challenging for research and the development of technologies targeted at global markets. The case study concerns the regional innovation system-based Multipolis network, which brings together technology-related actors in Northern Finland, located on both sides of the Arctic Circle, in an area of c.155,000 km(2) and with a population of 0.7 million. The results of the research, which used Q-methodology, reveal that networking is needed between technology development actors in the region and at various spatial levels. However, conflicting viewpoints on the development of Northern Finland exist, and indicate a mismatch between competitiveness policies to support high-technology development and regional policies to promote local employment. It is recommended that more attention should be paid to the governance of technology development in peripheral areas.

AB  - In the southern and central parts of Finland, Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) lives in large non-fragmented spruce-dominated forests. Due to the reduction of such forests, Siberian jay has disappeared from the southern parts of Finland. This study analyzed continuous-cover uneven-aged forest management as a way to maintain Siberian jay habitats simultaneously with timber production. Continuous cover management is able to provide the necessary spatial and temporal continuity of forest features important to the viability of Siberian jay populations. The study analyzed the relationship between habitat quality of Siberian jay and profitability of uneven-aged management of Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Profitability was evaluated by the net present value of timber sales, calculated with 2% discount rate. The results showed that uneven-aged management that maximizes economic profitability is not seriously in conflict with the maintenance of feeding habitats; there was a temporary decline in habitat quality after the cutting treatment but the decline was not drastic and the habitat recovered during the 15-year cutting cycle. Maintenance of nesting habitat reduced the profitability of timber production by 50-60% and wood production was decreased by 23%. Since nesting habitats cover only some tens of hectares within a home range of 200-500 ha, the impact of habitat maintenance on timber production would be rather small in continuous cover forest management.

AB  - Climate change adaptation is rising on the agenda of cities. However, critics have argued that urban adaptation efforts largely focus on preserving economic growth while overlooking the root causes of unequal vulnerability to climate impacts, giving rise to climate injustices. In response, literature on transformational adaptation has politicized these issues but it has remained largely conceptual, particularly in relation to the question of which actors can define and advance transformative approaches. Furthermore, existing empirical studies focus on positive cases while ignoring why these issues more commonly are not politicized. In this article, we add empirical rigour to these debates through an investigation into Malmo center dot's climate politics. We analyse what enables or inhibits the role of three political outsiders - disadvantaged communities, climate movements and social justice activists - in politicizing urban climate adaptation. We find that, while the most vulnerable social groups struggle with climatic impacts and experience difficulties in politicizing these issues, climate movements remain focused on climate mitigation and largely ignore local adaptation. In turn, we highlight the untapped capacity of social justice activism to act as social infrastructure for adaptation. Our findings suggest that alliances between the victims of adaptation injustices and local activist groups could support the politicization of those grievances by responding to emerging needs and by building policy-oriented pressure for transformational adaptation. However, we identify several factors that limit this potential, thereby contributing to an understanding of why social movements sometimes do not live up to their transformational potential.

AB  - Experimentation has become one of the prevailing modes of governing the transition toward sustainable practices in urban environments. The spatial variation of urban sustainability tran-sition has been attributed to a variety of conditions erected at different spatial scales. What re-mains less well-understood is how spatial situatedness shapes agency in urban experiments and the shapes agency can take is a field that requires further research and frameworks. The paper addresses this gap by introducing a framework from the literature on regional development, identifying three distinct types of agency that shape regional development processes. Combining this framework with a process perspective on urban experiments, we develop an analytical framework, which allows for a more granular understanding of agency in urban sustainability transitions. The analytical framework is then brought to use in a case study of an urban experi-ment aiming to electrify public transport in Gothenburg, Sweden.

AB  - 1 We investigated insects overwintering in Norway spruce and Scots pine killed by cambium-feeding beetles. The study was conducted in five large forests in north-eastern Poland. Insects were reared from wood samples cut from the upper and lower parts of trees growing in both shaded and sun-exposed conditions.
   2 We found that the species richness of overwintering insects on killed trees was mainly driven by the position in the lower trunk strata rather than in crowns or along a sun-shade gradient. Even though pine and spruce shared almost the same species composition, spruce hosted a significantly higher number of species, including beneficial ones.
   3 These results support the hypothesis that disturbance regimes change the spatial distribution of biodiversity, which is higher in low strata, as is known for abiotic disturbances that change the environment of the forest.
   4 One of the most important messages emerging from the present study is that pest beetle disturbance during non-outbreak periods creates habitats that are necessary for the survival of myriads of other insects. Thus, maintaining parts of the trees that were killed by bark and wood-boring beetles, especially high stumps, would help to support biodiversity in managed forests.

   The article draws on the theory of conventions to analyse the shift in the geographical origin of salted codfish consumed in Spain. Since the mid-1990s, Norway has lost most of its market share to new suppliers such as Iceland. The authors analyse a dataset comprising statistical data and information from semi-structured interviews conducted with Spanish processing companies, retail outlets, foodservice managers, and private consumers. They find that this substitution process is a consequence of the ability of new suppliers to meet the more complex demands of the increasingly segmented Spanish market. Further, regional consumption patterns in Spain are diverging from the comparatively homogeneous situation that underpinned the traditional Norwegian hegemony. Industrial, market, and public conventions have become more influential in the most populated regions, such as Madrid, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. The authors argue that a stronger focus on the upper segment of the Spanish codfish market, based on domestic, ecological, and civic conventions, might constitute a reliable strategy for Norwegian producers to recapture some of their market share. It is concluded that concerned consumers in Spain are still sensitive to attributes related to origin, sustainability, and local development, all of which underpin the Norwegian salted codfish production system.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore the sustainability values that tourism companies communicate to stakeholders. The following two research questions are addressed: What sustainability value (economic, social, or environmental) do tourism companies focus on and communicate in their sustainability information? Do different types of tourism companies provide different sustainability communications to stakeholders to gain legitimacy? A case study was conducted of 30 Swedish-based tourism companies. Written documents that were available online concerning sustainability information from these companies were analysed using the GRI model. The results show that tourism companies work to create value with the help of sustainability. The results also indicate that the context and prerequisites for each type of tourism company govern what they work with in order to meet the demands of stakeholders. The study's theoretical contribution is that sustainability communication to stakeholders can be of value to tourism companies. Its practical contribution is that, in addition to pursuing sustainability, tourism companies should communicate their sustainability work to their stakeholders in order to create value.

AB  - Landscapes tell stories of the lives and dwelling of those who inhabit them. They are not given, but in constant motion. In North Norwegian coastal societies cultural landscapes are rapidly transforming. One of the most visible and debated agents of landscape transformations are weeds such as cow parsley and dock. As well as threatening the biodiversity of coastal landscapes, the invading weeds seem to challenge the embodied landscapes of their dwellers. Focusing on the rapid spread of cow parsley, this article investigates complex and contested aspects of landscape changes. Inspired by Ingold's phenomenological perspective as well as performative theories, we search for ways of approaching hybridized relations within dwelt places. The transformative agency of cow parsley is used as a lens to approach societal dynamics and challenges. Through a study of the coastal community of HerOy in Northern Norway, we have explored people's engagement with the changing cultural landscape. The cow parsley covered landscape is perceived as a deteriorated landscape and as such seems to affect a form of alienation. We demonstrate a disruption between the emerging landscape produced by new ways of dwelling, and the landscape people wish to dwell in. What happens when the landscape tells stories which their dwellers do not want to be part of?

AB  - This paper explores the lessons learned by leaders in agricultural adaptation planning in order to assist other jurisdictions to develop adaptation strategies. It seeks to identify effective institutional, participatory and collaborative processes involved in designing agricultural adaptation strategies at the national and sub-national levels in Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Its methodology is based on review of agricultural adaptation policy documents, research initiatives, stakeholder engagement processes, and cross-sectoral collaborations as well as interviews with key informants such as leaders and actors in adaptation planning. The gathered data show that early adapters have an improved regional and national understanding of climatic impacts, and of the risks to agriculture before the initiation of the planning process. The results indicate that the interplay between bottom-up and top-down initiatives has been crucial in the development of adaptation strategies. The former has provided rich and robust participation in designing, implementing and monitoring adaptations, while the latter was important for prioritizing and legitimizing the development of strategy. It also provided access to high-level decision makers and funding. The results of the study suggest that fostering cross-sectoral collaborations-especially by focusing on broader questions such as the role of agriculture in society-has become an important part of adaptation planning. Finally, our results also stress that adaptation planning in agriculture could be enhanced by skills development and mutual learning across stakeholder groups, research and policy-makers, and through the ongoing interactive development of institutional capabilities.

AB  - 1. Uncultivated field boundaries constitute a significant part of the remaining semi-natural habitat in simplified agricultural landscapes, providing habitats for many grassland species. In Europe, agri-environment schemes (AES) offer incentives to farmers to manage farmland more environmentally friendly. In Sweden, one AES has specifically targeted management of incidental habitats on farmland by promoting removal of woody vegetation to benefit cultural heritage and biodiversity.
   2. This study investigates if pollinating insects benefit from removal of woody vegetation and whether any such benefits depend on the structural complexity of the surrounding landscape. Using a nested study design, pollinator communities were compared in pairs of managed and unmanaged field boundaries in landscapes of different complexity.
   3. The effect of removing trees and bushes in field boundaries varied among pollinator groups. Bumblebee species richness and abundance benefited from the management, whereas the species richness of solitary bees and hoverflies were unaffected. The abundance of solitary bees was higher in managed field boundaries, but only late in the season in complex landscapes, while the same management lowered the hoverfly abundance particularly late in the season. Landscape complexity did not affect bumblebees, while the abundance of solitary bees and the species richness of hoverflies were positively correlated with increasing landscape complexity, but at different spatial scales.
   4. The contrasting effects of management on different organism groups shown in this study, illustrate the importance of studies conducted on multiple taxa. Management prescriptions based on results from one pollinator group may not benefit other pollinator groups.

AB  - While recent research on intelligent transportation systems including vehicular communication systems has focused on technical aspects, little research work has been conducted on drivers' privacy perceptions and preferences. Understanding the driver's privacy perceptions and preferences will allow researchers to design usable privacy and identity management systems offering user privacy choices and controls for intelligent transportation systems. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 Swedish drivers to analyse their privacy perceptions and preferences for intelligent transportation systems, partic-ularly for user control and for privacy trade-offs with cost, safety and usability. We also compare our re-sults from the interviews with Swedish drivers with results from interviews that we conducted previously with South African drivers. Our cross-cultural comparison shows that perceived privacy implications, the drivers' willingness to share location information under certain conditions with other parties, as well as their appreciation of Privacy Enhancing Technologies differ significantly across drivers with different cultural backgrounds. We further discuss the cultural impact on privacy preferences, including those for privacy trade-offs, and the implications of our results for usable privacy-enhancing Identity Management for future vehicular communication systems. In particular, we provide recommendations for suitable pre-defined privacy options to be offered to users with different cultural backgrounds enabling them to easily make privacy-related control choices.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The benefits and costs of wildlife are contingent on the spatial overlap of animal populations with economic and recreational human activities. By using a production function approach with dynamic spatial panel data models, we analyze the effects of human hunting and carnivore predation pressure on the value of ungulate game harvests. The results show evidence of dynamic spatial dependence in the harvests of roe deer and wild boar, but not in those of moose, which is likely explained by the presence of harvesting quotas for the latter. Results suggest the impact of lynx on roe deer harvesting values is reduced by 75% when spatial effects are taken into account. The spatial analysis confirms that policymakers' aim to reduce wild boar populations through increased hunting has been successful, an effect that was only visible when considering spatial effects.

I contrast two cases, the planning and implementation of the Natura 2000 reserve network and the Regional Forest Programme of Southwest Finland and discuss the elements that make the former process conflictual and the latter consensual. An analogy between ecosystem health and institutional health connects the vocabulary used in this paper with the vocabulary of environmental sciences and management. I describe the constituents of institutional health and discuss their importance in affording groups and individuals with power to resist, liabilities to resilience and capacity to adapt. I conclude by presenting a case for reform in development and environmental planning. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - European populations of geese, swans and cranes have increased considerably since the 1970s raising conflicts between conservation and farming interests. Crop damage caused by geese, swans and cranes across the national scale needs a trans-boundary approach that captures the site-specific characteristics of crop damage at a more refined spatial scale, to deal with the high spatio-temporal variation inherent in the system and to avoid conflict displacement. In the present study we use long-term crop damage data (2000-2015) in Sweden to evaluate seasonal and annual patterns of crop damage. We show that crop damage increased over years but followed a fairly consistent seasonal pattern during the later parts of the study period. We show how these seasonal patterns differ across the country such that trans-boundary regions with similar patterns of crop damage, relating to different nuisance species and damaged crops, can be identified. These findings about spatio-temporal variation of damage can be used to find appropriate scales of management units (e.g. areas with similar conditions), and to adapt damage mitigation strategies to temporal and spatial-specific conditions, e.g. guidance of when and where certain crop may be suitable as sacrificial crops.

AB  - The plasticity of leaf form and function in European lines of Arabidopsis thaliana was evaluated in ecotypes from Sweden and Italy grown under contrasting (cool versus hot) temperature regimes. Although both ecotypes exhibited acclimatory adjustments, the Swedish ecotype exhibited more pronounced responses to the two contrasting temperature regimes in several characterized features. These responses included thicker leaves with higher capacities for photosynthesis, likely facilitated by a greater number of phloem cells per minor vein for the active loading and export of sugars, when grown under cool temperature as opposed to leaves with a higher vein density and a greater number of tracheary elements per minor vein, likely facilitating higher rates of transpirational water loss (and thus evaporative cooling), when grown under hot temperature with high water availability. In addition, only the Swedish ecotype exhibited reduced rosette growth and greater levels of foliar tocopherols under the hot growth temperature. These responses, and the greater responsiveness of the Swedish ecotype compared with the Italian ecotype, are discussed in the context of redox signalling networks and transcription factors, and the greater range of environmental conditions experienced by the Swedish versus the Italian ecotype during the growing season in their native habitats.

AB  - A fine-scale fragmented ar ea (twenty-two 40 x 40 m clear-cuts) and a coarse-scale fragmented area (three 150 x 150 m clear-cuts) were created in a spruce forest in Norway during 1995-1996. Before and after the logging, in 1994 and 1997 respectively, ground beetles were sampled in pitfall traps between the clear-cuts and from an untouched control area. Seven eurytopic forest species accounted for 99% of the catch. In the fine-scale fragmented area the abundance of Leistus terminatus was significantly negatively affected by fragmentation, whereas in the coarse-scale fragmented area L. terminatus, Trechus obtusus and Calathus micropterus were significantly negatively affected. No clear indications of area or edge effects were found. Isolation effects probably were minimal. The ambiguity in the explanation of the results is likely to be due to species-specific and complex responses to the different aspects of habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Glaciers are widely recognized as key indicators of climate change, and their meltwater plays an important role in hydropower production in Norway. Since the last glacier inventory was compiled in northern Norway in the 1970s, marked fluctuations in glacier length and mass balance have been reported for individual glaciers, and the current overall glacier state is thus not well known. Within the framework of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative, we have created a new inventory for 489 glaciers in the Svartisen region, northern Norway, using a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite scene from 7 September 1999 and automated multispectral glacier mapping (thresholded band ratios). In addition, visual inspection and correction of the generated glacier outlines has been applied. Adverse snow conditions and uncertain drainage divides made glacier mapping challenging in some regions of the study site. Glacier outlines from 1968, as digitized from a topographic map, were used for a quantitative change assessment for a selection of 300 glaciers. The overall area change of this sample from 1968 to 1999 was close to zero, but with a strongly increasing scatter towards smaller glaciers, large area gains (> 50%) for small glaciers (< 1 km(2)), and an unexpected stronger relative area loss towards the wetter coast. The overall size changes are small (< 1%) for the three largest ice masses in the study region (Vestisen, Ostisen and Blamannsisen).

The main purpose is to establish a faster link east -west between the EIS and the E6, and to relieve the road network through Oslo of some of the east-west traffic. Both the project and the fjord tunnel have been designed in accordance with ideals for the journey experience, which were developed in the 1960s by Appleyard, Lynch and Myer. One of the objectives of this project was that the road should be adapted to the landscape and provide travellers with a more enjoyable journey. This paper will focus on the design of the sub-sea tunnel.

TI  - Conceptualising Knowledge in Spatial Planning and Displacement of "the Political"
T2  - DISP
LA  - English
AB  - This paper argues that organising spatial planning policies by funding local projects constitutes a steering mode that organises knowledge in such a way that it contributes to displacing "the political" in local spatial planning practice. "The political" is conceptualised as a space of agonistic conflicts and choice-making (Mouffe 2005a). Such an organisation of knowledge operates to consolidate the initial framing of the problem, in which the goal and the possibility to monitor the goal is in focus, rather than challenging or questioning it in the name of justness and fairness. This is illustrated through an analysis of conceptualisations of knowledge within 127 project applications within the Swedish government's Safe and Gender Equal planning policy (2008-2010), which the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning facilitated in conjunction with the County Administration Boards of Sweden.

AB  - I quantified local species richness of birds in different forest types and of beetles in spruce forests at different altitudes. In both cases I quantified timber production as a measure of land acquisition cost and use the ratio between the species richness and timber production as a measure of conservation cost-efficiency. I found a positive correlation between timber production and local species richness of birds as well as beetles, indicating that the forests most valuable for forestry are also the ones most valuable for biodiversity conservation. I used different selection procedures for combining sites in a reverse network to find the minimum set of sites that included all vulnerable species. The minimum set of sites for birds was 30% spruce forest, 30% pine forest, and 40% broad-leaved forest (the three main forest types). The minimum set of sites for the beetles was uniformly distributed along the altitudinal gradient. Both minimum sets were mot cost-efficient for species conservation. I suggest that equal coverage of different productivity classes is more efficient for optimizing biodiversity conservation than over-representing low productivity sites. Less than 1% of Norwegian boreal forests have been protected as nature reserves. The reserve network is fairly representative with respect to altitude, but it is seriously skewed toward low productivity sites. The current network is suboptimal with respect to forest type representativeness, species protection, and cost-efficiency. This is a result of an inefficient strategy of selecting reserve sites and an unfortunate combination of selection criteria.

AB  - We present the most comprehensive pan-European assessment of future changes in cropland and grassland soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to date, using a dedicated process-based SOC model and state-of-the-art databases of soil, climate change, land-use change and technology change. Soil carbon change was calculated using the Rothamsted carbon model on a European 10 x 10' grid using climate data from four global climate models implementing four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios (SRES). Changes in net primary production (NPP) were calculated by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model. Land-use change scenarios, interpreted from the narratives of the IPCC SRES story lines, were used to project changes in cropland and grassland areas. Projections for 1990-2080 are presented for mineral soil only.
   Climate effects (soil temperature and moisture) will tend to speed decomposition and cause soil carbon stocks to decrease, whereas increases in carbon input because of increasing NPP will slow the loss. Technological improvement may further increase carbon inputs to the soil. Changes in cropland and grassland areas will further affect the total soil carbon stock of European croplands and grasslands. While climate change will be a key driver of change in soil carbon over the 21st Century, changes in technology and land-use change are estimated to have very significant effects.
   When incorporating all factors, cropland and grassland soils show a small increase in soil carbon on a per area basis under future climate (1-7 t C ha(-1) for cropland and 3-6 t C ha(-1) for grassland), but when the greatly decreasing area of cropland and grassland are accounted for, total European cropland stocks decline in all scenarios, and grassland stocks decline in all but one scenario. Different trends are seen in different regions. For Europe (the EU25 plus Norway and Switzerland), the cropland SOC stock decreases from 11 Pg in 1990 by 4-6 Pg (39-54%) by 2080, and the grassland SOC stock increases from 6 Pg in 1990 to 1.5 Pg (25%) under the B1 scenario, but decreases to 1-3 Pg (20-44%) under the other scenarios. Uncertainty associated with the land-use and technology scenarios remains unquantified, but worst-case quantified uncertainties are 22.5% for croplands and 16% for grasslands, equivalent to potential errors of 2.5 and 1 Pg SOC, respectively. This is equivalent to 42-63% of the predicted SOC stock change for croplands and 33-100% of the predicted SOC stock change for grasslands. Implications for accounting for SOC changes under the Kyoto Protocol are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses the contributions of international lifestyle immigrants to new tourism development and innovation in the sparsely populated north of Sweden. Based on a qualitative case study, the paper examines how lifestyle immigrants contributed as tourism entrepreneurs to the formation of local capital in tourism, and stimulated local learning and innovation spillover through networks of interaction and collaboration. The theoretical framework integrates concepts from rural lifestyle migration, local community development, and local tourism innovation systems. The results document how immigrants emerged as important drivers of new tourism products, processes and markets, and introduced a range of new ideas, skills and external networks to the region. Yet, an in-depth social network analysis reveals that immigrants made more limited contributions to networks, collaborations and knowledge exchange with local tourism stakeholders, thus limiting learning outcomes and innovation spillover at a broader local system level. Reasons for this lack of systemic interaction included socio-cultural distance between immigrants and locals, limited levels of trust and reciprocity, diverging development and lifestyle priorities, and issues around exclusive immigrant networking. Finally, the relevance of the theoretical framework is discussed in relation to its applicability to other immigrant mobilities in sparsely populated rural areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During initial ethnographic fieldwork among Norwegian long-term visitors in the province of Alicante in Spain, these visitors expressed concern about the manner in which they were portrayed in the Norwegian news media, in contrast to their own images as holidaymakers. This problem is partly epistemological, since 'long-term visitors' were uncertain about their status and role. For instance, on sightseeing tours, sports events or hiking trips, they were tourists. At other times, for instance, when dealing with local authorities, they saw themselves as different from pure tourists. The Norwegian long-termers stated that their stay in Spain was far more multifaceted than what had been portrayed in the media, that they participated in cultural and social activities, and that they had many points of contact with Spanish society. The Norwegian visitors wondered how a more accurate and multi-vocal image of holidaymakers and long-termers could be represented. The concepts of local knowledge, adaptation and discourse will be used here to problematise this timely topic in tourism research on roles and images. Developing a more comprehensive view of long-term visitors will focus not only on their own situation, but also on their relations with other visitors, the host population, and Spanish authorities.

AB  - The role of the forest sector in Finland and in Sweden is the starting point for a case study presenting motifs for forest bioenergy in the two countries. Forest bioenergy, evolving in symbiosis with the forest industry, has become important. The successful development builds on piggy-backing conventional forestry, rather than on parallel supply systems.
   After thirty years, forest biomass has become the largest energy source in the two countries, contributing almost 1/5 of the energy needs. For developed countries, Sweden and Finland have leading positions in the use of forest fuel, and in related technologies and methods. However, progress has not been simple and drivers for the development have changed over time.
   The 1970s << oil crises >> put initial focus on energy security and on reducing the dependence on imported fuels. Later, other motifs have become fundamental. Sustainability aspects - especially mitigating climate change - have emerged as key arguments. Fuels from sustainably managed forests cause minor, if any, emissions of carbon dioxide.
   The facts that wood-based fuels create rural jobs and improve the trade balance have been ancillary motifs, and the increased net sale of forest products that follows on fuel production will increase the cash flow of the forest owner. However, due to low compensation and high costs compared to the traditional forest products, from the forest owners' perspective, the economic motifs for forest fuel harvesting are not decisive.
   For economic use of biomass, heat sinks are important. Combined heat and power, e.g. for district heating plus electricity to the grid or for industrial process heat and power are profitable options. Further refinement is possible but its potential to increase profitability seems limited.

AB  - The theory and practice of decolonization present an awkward paradox: How can social change occur in everyday life to disrupt state structures while entangled with the mundane, social, and institutional practices and representations that perpetuate state power? In Sipmi, the transborder Indigenous Simi homeland, decolonization has been intertwined with the institutionalization of Simi governance and cultural reclamation through national governing bodies. In the Finnish-controlled regions, failures of national recognition of Simi self-determination have fueled disenchantment with established political platforms and a growing movement to enact self-representation outside these realms. A study of Simi craft making uncovers embodied mechanisms of decolonization, actualized through production as fluid boundary making and intergenerational healing. Craft makers reinforce relationships to land and family networks in ways that unsettle racialized and legal delineations of community belonging, redirecting the power of representation away from state-constrained decision-making bodies and toward everyday Simi practice. In doing so, they also negotiate their own use of rejected tropes and colonial networks of production. This interplay establishes the transformative potential and constraints of an embodied decolonization.

AB  - The mountain areas of Europe have been of vital importance in the system of summer farming whereby the movement of livestock between different altitudinal levels is a key element. However, summer farming has been downscaled considerably during the 20th century. The article describes two areas where summer farming is still practised: Forollhogna in Norway, and Asturias in Spain. The authors document the transhumance system in the two areas, and investigate how farmers view the summer farming system and landscape, how they relate to nature protection, and whether specific value orientations can be detected in their views. The findings show that the logic behind summer farming is the same in both areas: economic motivation and access to grazing grounds. With regard to nature and landscape protection, the opinion that wild nature is given priority and that 'managed nature' of transhumance is overlooked was found in both areas, although it was expressed more strongly in Asturias than in Forollhogna. Opinions and ideals related to 'good farming' were found in both contexts, and were reflected in well-kept fields and productive and healthy livestock.

AB  - The family businesses play all important role regarding the dynamism and strength of the European economy, bug-term stability and sustainability Many of the challenges facing family businesses also concern Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), but due to the fact that family businesses involve three overlapping elements (the family, the business, and the ownership) they are different from other types of businesses. In Europe the family business sector is dominated by particularly micro enterprises with less than 10 employees and SMEs. Across Europe around 70-80% of all enterprises are family businesses. The current financial crisis has influenced negatively the majority of business activities and many family businesses found themselves in a new turbulent financial environment where uncertainty dominates and the market characteristics are radically reversed.
   This paper recoatizes the importance of family businesses in both the Finnish and the Greek economy and the need for in-depth research about the dynamics of family businesses, the difficulties they face (strategy, succession, internal conflicts etc.) and factors influencing their survival (endurance) and sustainability. Despite the differences in economic structure and culture both Finland and Greece are small countries in the outskirts of Europe with a high percentage of family businesses. Finland counts on a highly industrialized manufacturing sector and is one of the economically and politically most stable countries in the world, whilst Greece relies on the service sector and in particular on tourism.
   Currently a cross-cultural study between Greece and Finland is undertaken. It includes an extensive literature review for deeper understanding of the research variables. In addition it incorporates a qualitative and quantitative research methodology. This paper describes mainly the results of a qualitative study carried out in 60 family businesses in the North-western part of Thessaloniki, Greece. The aims of the study were to record the new conditions that prevail concerning business operations in family businesses. The main findings from our study show that family businesses can combine sentiments with business dexterity and create unique dynamics towards business decisions. The financial crisis can be perceived as pushed "opportunity' in many functional areas of the business for reformation towards business sustainability and the creation of competitive advantage. It converts into a cause of reorganization of business plans and helps the company to adopt more formal management procedures for decision making. The combination of emotion with entrepreneurship also brings family members around a common goal of survival and due to the two separate systems of "family" and "business" resulting in a dynamic growth in the middle of the crisis. The adoption of a lean and flexible budget is an important parameter in responding to the financial crisis. Family firms have the advantage of being motivated and supported by all family members who are involved in the family business (e.g. willingness to work long days under difficult conditions with limitedly rewards), while in non-family businesses such commitment is more difficult to obtain. Other incentives for surviving the financial crisis can be contributed to the considerable consequence that a failure of a family business may have on the leader; there is a high risk regarding the family property, negative publicity of the family's name, and the sense of cancellation of the family's legacy. Managers of a non-family business do not encounter such pressures. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Working with beef cattle in an open area or while on pasture has been shown to expose workers to a high risk of work-related injury. Prior research on this problem has been conducted using mail surveys, interviews, self-reporting of work practices and injury experiences, and summaries of published injury data, including media reports. Prior research on injury prevention has largely focused on worker education in a specific cultural or geographical setting. A pilot study was conducted to test the cross-cultural usability of the Working Environment Screening Tool in Agriculture (WEST-AG), a modification of the WEST, developed for Swedish industrial applications, to assess risk factors associated with farmers working with cattle being raised largely on pasture as compared with cattle raised in confined feeding operations. Swedish and English language versions of WEST-AG were developed and pilot-tested on a convenient sample of eight Swedish and eight Indiana farms that raise beef cattle primarily on pasture. On-site observations were conducted independently by Swedish and US agricultural safety professionals and documented using photography and a 15-risk-of-injury component on an 11-degree linear scale. Comparisons were made between independent observations documented from the Swedish and Indiana application of the WEST, including collective assessment of photographic record, and the results reported. Key findings included (a) a higher level of observed risks on Indiana farms studied as compared with their Swedish counterparts; (b) high levels of worker exposure to cattle, especially mature breeding bulls, on both sets of farms; (c) a higher frequency of self-reported farm-related injuries than anticipated on both Swedish and Indiana farms; (d) substantially different economic, social, cultural, and regulatory forces that influence small-operation Swedish and Indiana beef producers' decisions regarding adoption of safer work practices, including use of new and safer technology; and (e) differences between the interpretations of the levels or severity of risks observed between the Swedish and US researchers conducting the assessments based upon regulatory and cultural context. Recommendations for enhancing the methodology of applying the WEST-AG to beef production are discussed, along with utilizing the findings to recommend steps to enhance worker safety on small beef farms, regardless of cultural setting. The most significant contribution of this study was to explore the viability of an assessment tool for agricultural workplaces that could be used internationally to enhance worker safety and health regardless of cultural and political differences.

AB  - In the future greenhouse gas emission targets will be more ambitious and therefore solutions for of CO2 emissions reduction more than 80% are sought. In thermal power plants these high levels of emission reductions can be reached with CCS technologies or by utilizing high shares of biomass based fuels. Following from the national targets of Finland, the power plants being planned at the moment need to take these targets into account in the planning phase as options that need to be fulfilled at least in the future if not immediately. In this paper high plant level CO2 emission reduction targets are analysed for two large power plants that are planned to be constructed in Finland in the near future. Both are located close to urban areas and supply also district heat to neighboring cities. Both also face high political pressure to significant emission reductions in comparison to existing system.
   This paper is based on a case study of a planned combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Finland having fuel power of 420MW(fuel). The boiler island is plant based on circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler technology enabling combustion of high shares of biomass. The paper is shortly describing technologies that are needed for reduction of CO2 emissions when carbon capture based on oxyfuel technology and biomass firing based on high shares of forest residues are considered. The implications of applying these technologies and suitability for CHP environment are considered and economic feasibility of the solutions compared. Also the possibilities and feasibility of reaching negative emissions with combination of biomass firing and CCS is briefly assessed.
   Results show significant emission reduction potential associated to both technologies. The major costs associated to CCS are caused by the equipment investment, loss of electricity production due to energy penalty and transportation and storage of CO2. The costs associated to biomass combustion with high shares are mainly caused by higher prices of biomass fuel in comparison to coal and lower power-to-heat ratio. Large biomass share has an increasing impact also on plant investment and O&M costs.
   On the other hand, significant savings are achieved in terms of CO2 allowances. When discussing the biomass option one must also address questions related to availability of sustainable biomass, effecting pricing and competition of raw material between different uses such as forest industry or liquid biofuels production. And this further highlights the discussion on carbon stocks and carbon debt especially when Bio-CCS is considered.
   If the profound emission reduction targets are to be met, economically the difference between the technologies considered is not clear in all circumstances. All the most important parameters for the economic lifetime of the power plant include significant uncertainty therefore in this paper main focus has been in sensitivity analysis. The study reveals some major economical restrictions of the applicability of these emission reduction solutions. The pros and cons of the technologies in the light of feasibility and the role of these technologies as carbon abatement tools are discussed. The major factor effecting the technology decision is plant location in relation to availability of biomass, coal and CO2 transportation&storage options, as well as heat demand (possibility to utilize CHP) in addition to political atmosphere and acceptability of technologies.

AB  - The management of the Norwegian Northeast Atlantic cod fishery has in many ways been a success story; quotas have been high (but now declining), profitability has been higher than most other industries and there is great interest among young recruits to enter the fishery. However, over the last decade illegal fishing of allocated quotas and black-market transactions throughout the value chain have become a significant of the political debate in the fishey, especially in northern Norway. Fisheries crime has been described as a priority area for law enforcement. To combat illegal overfishing the introduction of new automatic catch monitoring technologies onboard fishing vessels is considered a key strategy by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. However, the new quota control measures are met with considerable resistance by the fishermen. This paper outlines the key el-ements of modern fisheries management to address sustainability goals, how the institutional subsystems connect with each other, and how illegal overfishing may threaten the stability of the entire management system. The gravity of illegal overfishing supports the authorities' new strategies to increase catch-and quota control. Nevertheless, the implementation of new control technologies may not be straightforward. Especially small-scale fishermen have presented a number of valid arguments against the proposed control measures. Thus, this study outlines how the implementation process may gain increased support from the fishermen.

AB  - In taking the decision whether or not to eradicate the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) from islands off the coast of Brittany in France, some aspects of the general subject of alien species eradication was examined, in an attempt to answer the following question: What is the significance of islands for conservation and restoration of the biodiversity? Can we accept the concept of the "naturalisation" of an alien species, and if so, how do we recognize it? What are the criteria on which we base a decision to eradicate a species in place for a "long time"? It appears in conclusion that, as far as we know, the house mouse (Mus musculus), the ship rat (Rattus rattus) and the Norway rat did not reach the coast of Brittany before 3 000, 2 000 and 500 years BP respectively, that is to say, after the last Quaternary transgression which induced the insularity of the Brittany islands. Consequently, their is a great probability that the spread of these species onto Brittany islands was caused by human activity. Moreover, the literature give no evidence that any of these species fills any of the criteria quoted by Usher (1989) and Chapuis et al. (1996) preventing its eradication.

AB  - Capsule Woodland structure, rather than tree species, is the most important determinant of breeding habitat selection by Willow Warblers in North West England.
   Aims To examine how habitat characteristics predict the occurrence of male Willow Warbler territories.
   Methods Woodland structure (trunk density, trunk diameter, canopy cover and understory cover), tree species and food abundance were compared between woodland areas within and outside of male territories at a site in the UK.
   Results Territories contained higher trunk numbers, had a narrow range of trunk diameters, and intermediate canopy cover. Food abundance did not differ with occupancy. Willow and alder were the most common trees within territories, in contrast to birch which has been found in previous studies. The habitat structure matches young woodlands, where birches often grow. However, at the study site the birches were large and mature, and therefore unsuitable. Moreover, woodland structure variables were better predictors of occupancy than any particular tree genera.
   Conclusion The results indicate that vegetation structure, but not tree species or food availability, influence breeding habitat selection by Willow Warblers. The preferred structure is similar to coppice woodlands; therefore, the Willow Warbler decline may be linked to the loss of this traditional management across south England.

AB  - An extensive body of literature demonstrates how higher density leads to more efficient energy use and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport and housing. However, our current understanding seems to be limited on the relationships between the urban form and the GHG emissions, namely how the urban form affects the lifestyles and thus the GHGs on a much wider scale than traditionally assumed. The urban form affects housing types, commuting distances, availability of different goods and services, social contacts and emulation, and the alternatives for pastimes, meaning that lifestyles are actually situated instead of personal projects. As almost all consumption, be it services or products, involves GHG emissions, looking at the emissions from transport and housing may not be sufficient to define whether one form would be more desirable than another. In the paper we analyze the urban form-lifestyle relationships in Finland together with the resulting GHG implications, employing both monetary expenditure and time use data to portray lifestyles in different basic urban forms: metropolitan, urban, semi-urban and rural. The GHG implications are assessed with a life cycle assessment (LCA) method that takes into account the GHG emissions embedded in different goods and services. The paper depicts that, while the direct emissions from transportation and housing energy slightly decrease with higher density, the reductions can be easily overridden by sources of indirect emissions. We also highlight that the indirect emissions actually seem to have strong structural determinants, often undermined in studies concerning sustainable urban forms. Further, we introduce a concept of 'parallel consumption' to explain how the lifestyles especially in more urbanized areas lead to multiplication of consumption outside of the limits of time budget and the living environment. This is also part I of a two-stage study. In part II we will depict how various other contextual and socioeconomic variables are actually also very important to take into account, and how diverse GHG mitigation strategies would be needed for different types of area in different locations towards a low-carbon future.

AB  - The Salmon industry in Norway includes three sectors, namely sea and river fishing for wild salmon, and salmon farming, or aquaculture. The three sectors provide different social, economic and cultural benefits to society, but also face many problems and challenges. They have different interests, practices, traditions and audiences, and are also administered by different authorities and regulated under varying management regimes and legislations. On the one hand, they complement each other in terms of product supply, employment creation and income: on the other hand, they face conflicts over management objectives and strategies. This paper provides an overview of the salmon sectors associated with their status, challenges and management regimes. It further analyzes their interests and conflicts over economic contribution and management. Finally, some potential solutions are suggested in an attempt to solve these conflicts.

AB  - When two industries make competing claims to exploit resources in the same geographic area, conflicts may arise. While a substantial literature deals with the resolution of such conflicts between industrial interests and environmental conservation, the research on successful resolution of coastal industry-industry conflicts is limited. As noted by [45], "the emerging field of coastal conflict research has no clear contours. It develops from different disciplines, theories, approaches, practical knowledge requirements, and does not become, as far as can be foreseen, a fully integrated knowledge field...in-depth analysis of conflicts and empirically based approaches to conflict resolutions are hardly found". This article fills some of these knowledge gaps by empirically analysing how and to what extent the Norwegian regime governing the relationship between the oil and fishery industries along the Norwegian coast helps reduce conflict levels and resolve the conflicts that nevertheless arise. The article builds on both regime theory and conflict resolution theory to analyse its institutional design and effects, posing two research questions: First, what is the institutional design of the Norwegian oil and fisheries coexistence regime? Second: to what extent does the regime reduce the conflict potential and contribute towards conflict resolution?

AB  - This paper examines the tradeoffs between different uses of forests in three communes in the mountain region in northern Sweden. The most important uses of the forests include timber production, preservation of biodiversity, reindeer grazing and recreation. Management outcomes with respect to the different uses are measured in terms of the net present value (NPV) of timber production profits, the sum of deadwood volume over time, the minimum periodic lichen production, and a minimum periodic recreation index (RI). The analysis shows that the forests can be managed to achieve dramatically different mixes of NPV. deadwood volume, and lichen production, whereas the RI varies only within a narrow range. To maximize the NPV, lichen production would reduce by 40% from its maximum level, and the volume of deadwood would be close to 0 in period 2 and thereafter. Maximization of deadwood volume would lead to the maximum lichen production, while the NPV would fall below 0. Maximization of lichen production reduces the NPV by at least 20%, and could reduce the amount of deadwood by up to 75%. When lichen production is restricted to its maximum, there is a wide range of possible choices with respect to the mix of the NPV and deadwood volume. The marginal cost of increasing the deadwood volume ranges from 1.12 to 20 SEK/m(3). The choice between lichen production and deadwood volume is most flexible when the NPV is fixed at approximately 93% of its maximum. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using the contingent valuation method, this study examines the determinants of German tourists' willingness to pay for accommodation in a Finnish holiday cottage. A particular focus is on the communication of credentials relating to three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, socio-cultural, and economic). The results suggest that there are significant differences in how tourists value the different sustainability attributes of their accommodation. The environmental dimension was the only sustainability dimension to have a positive and statistically significant effect on tourists' willingness to pay. In terms of tourists' demographic characteristics, meanwhile, employment status was the only socio-demographic factor to have a significant effect on the tourists' willingness to pay. The managerial implications include investing in, and actively communicating, environmental sustainability features as part of a successful business strategy for Finnish cottage service providers targeting German tourists.

The empirical part of the paper builds on data collection at two aquaculture firms, one in Norway and one in Chile, where we have focused on the links between the innovation process and knowledge transfer and management, and how this can be built into the production and managerial system. First, we discuss what characterises knowledge flows and how this can be related to innovative initiatives, competence and culture. Second, we discuss how innovative ideas can transform into actual innovations. Third, we discuss how innovations are integrated in the production procedures and how this challenges knowledge management. We find, as do most studies, a link between successful knowledge management and innovations, but this link does not have the same structure in Norway and Chile. Differences in communication patterns, innovative behaviour and cultural characteristics are the most important factors to explain the differences.

AB  - We determined the proportion of butterfly species that occur as metapopulations with grasslands as the only habitat. We counted all butterflies in 19 semi-natural grassland patches in a forest-dominated landscape in southern Sweden over a 5-y period. Seven of the 44 butterfly species observed exhibited a metapopulation structure. The other species either use grassland mainly for adult feeding but not for breeding (8 species), breed both in grassland and in surrounding habitat types (19 species), or are grassland specialists but their colonization-extinction dynamics are probably not significant, since they were present in nearly all (> 80%) patches (10 species). Occupancy was generally higher in larger patches, and tended to increase with patch connectivity. Among grassland specialists and habitat generalists, the connectivity measure tended to explain more of the variation in occupancy if the shortest dispersal paths avoiding routes over water were considered rather than a measure based on the Euclidian distance between patches. This indicates that lakes, even when they are just a few hundred metres wide, can act as barriers to dispersal for butterflies. We conclude that for many butterflies that occur in semi-natural grasslands in forest-dominated landscapes, intervening habitats are important as breeding sites or as dispersal barriers.

AB  - Food supply chains encompass multiple actors and simultaneously produce multiple products that require transportation using various modes or networks before arriving on consumers' tables. Transportation costs and related carbon emissions along a supply chain, however, can be high, prompting a search for efficient management solutions. This paper proposes a mathematical formulation in the form of a mixed-integer linear programming model, drawing on evidence from a Norwegian salmon supply chain network. The model addresses environmental aspects by aiming to minimize the fuel cost component from various transportation modes and considers carbon emissions related restrictions. Testing using various problem instances highlights the robustness of the proposed mathematical formulation and models. Moreover, a real-world case study of a Norwegian salmon exporter helps understand the applicability of the proposed model. The paper discusses the impact of different supply chain arrangements regarding their overall cost, including fuel cost, and carbon emissions to understand the need for holistic optimization of food supply chains. Sensitivity analysis regarding demand variability allows the proposed mathematical model to restructure the Norwegian salmon supply chain network to meet fluctuating retail demand. Transportation scenario analysis emphasizes the importance of shifting from road to maritime transportation for certain routes to achieve financial and environmental gains.

AB  - High nest loss is an important driver of gallinaceous bird population dynamics. Identifying factors determining the spatial distribution of potential nest predators and thereby indirectly risk of nest losses is therefore essential. The aim of this 1-year study was to estimate relative predation rates on artificial ground nests in willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) habitats, along replicate altitudinal gradients (transects, n = 60) spanning from sub-Arctic birch forest to the low-alpine tundra in three locations in northern Norway. In each transect, one artificial nest (track board) was placed in three different habitats: (1) birch forest, (2) edge between birch forest and low-alpine tundra and (3) low-alpine tundra. Total predation rates over all habitats within locations ranged from 47.4% to 77.5% and did not vary systematically in space and time. The average predation rate by avian predators was consistently high (58%), and mammalian predation rate was consistently low (5.6%). The consistently high level of predation inflicted by birds was mainly due to omnipresent corvids, especially the hooded crow (Corvus cornix). Analysis of species-specific predation rates showed that habitat and location effects were insignificant for all species, except for raven (Corvus corax) that showed clearly higher predation in one of the locations. The results indicate that from the perspective of the spatial distribution of potential nest predators in sub-Arctic birch forest, ground nesting birds like willow ptarmigan should not be expected to be selective with respect to nesting habitat in the ecotone between birch forest and the low-alpine tundra.

AB  - Using the Finnish MELA model, a set of scenarios were produced and used to map the possibilities and risks surrounding the utilisation of peatlands in wood production in Finland. One of the scenarios was an estimate of allowable-cut calculated by maximising the net present value of the future revenues using a four per cent interest rate subject to non-decreasing flow of wood, saw logs and net income over a 50-year period, and net present value after the 50 year period greater or equal than in the beginning. The estimate for maximum regionally sustained removal in 1996-2005 was 68 million m(3) per year - approaching 74 million m(3) during the next decades. In this scenario, 14 per cent of all cuttings during the period 1996-2005 would be made on peatlands, which comprise ca. 31 per cent of the total area of forestry land. By the year 2025, the proportion of peatland cuttings would increase to over 20 per cent. The increase in future cutting possibilities on peatlands compensated for a temporary decrease in cuttings and growing stock on mineral soils. The allowable-cut effect was especially pronounced in northern Finland, where peatlands play an important role in wood production. In addition, the sensitivity of cutting possibilities for assumptions related to growth and price were analysed. The estimate of maximum sustainable yield as defined here seems to be fairly robust on the whole, except in northern Finland where the cutting scenarios were sensitive to the changes in the price of birch pulpwood. The proportion of peatland stands that are profitable for timber production depends on the interest rate: the higher the rate. of interest the less peatland stands are thinned. The effect of cutting profile on future logging conditions and resulting costs were analysed in two forestry centres. If clear cuttings on mineral soils are to be cut first, an increase in future logging costs is inevitable.

AB  - In western Europe, Finland is a country that has most recently cut down its large old-growth forests. In the 18th century, nearly one-third of the forests in the southern half of the country were real old-growth forests (> 200 years). In northern Finland, the proportion was almost half of the forested area. At present, the percentage of old-growth forests in the southern half is a mere 0.1 and in the northern half still a good 10. It is estimated that only 2% of the original old-growth forests now remain in the temperate regions of Finland, which are abundant with animal and plant species.
   Most of the profound changes in forests are attributable to human activities. In the severe Finnish climate, the utilisation of timber has been a necessity, and population growth further increased the demand for timber used for heating and other domestic purposes. Clearing fields for cultivation also reduced the forested areas, while the rise of industry also consumed increasing amounts of timber.
   Concurrently, since there were also factors that supported the growth of the standing timber stock, it is not self-evident that the timber volume was in constant decline. First, after the Little Ice Age (1550-1850) the average annual temperature has risen and the annual growth period has lengthened. Both of these features have stimulated the growth of trees. Second, the use of timber in industry and space heating has continued to become more efficient and economical. Third, a significant feature in the changes in space heating is that firewood has to a great extent been replaced by other energy sources. Consequently, the demand for timber in the Finnish economy has not increased steadily-at least not parallel to GDP.
   While the felling of timber decisively increased in the 19th century, more attention was paid to forestry in order to guarantee sustainability. Both the governmental forest policy and the actions of private landowners aimed to increase the growth of the standing timber stock. However, it took many years before forestry achieved tangible results in promoting growth. Only in the late 20th century was there unanimous agreement that the standing timber stock has been increasing, and even today, researchers do not agree on the situation before the 1950s.
   This paper focuses on examining the relationship between the consumption of timber and the growth of standing timber stock. The key research question is whether, during the past two centuries, Finland ever overused its forests to the extent that the annual felling exceeded the annual growth of timber.

AB  - A parking space is the beginning and the end of every car journey. Policies aimed at parking spaces are, thus, an effective way of affecting car travel. Policies regarding parking typically mean setting minimum parking requirements to meet the peak demand for parking. However, in several Swedish cities, as well as around Europe, attempts are made to lower the number of parking places. One way is to build homes without parking places for cars and pilot projects with zero-parking have started to materialize. This paper looks into the academic literature in the field of design and architecture to see how parking issues are dealt with. It also looks into ongoing practice by studying three pilot projects in Sweden that challenge the dominant parking norm by planning and building for a new normal-mobility convenience and zero parking. Both the literature and the cases point to little knowledge in the field. However, high demands on "creative mobility solutions" are placed on housing projects without parking places for cars. Even if the effects of sustainability are still unknown, zero parking pilot projects can narrate the possibility of another future-a future with mobility convenience instead of parking convenience.

AB  - The amount of green space in urban areas is shrinking. Densification and the introduction of new user groups in most cities today is leading to more intensive use of public spaces and the need for more space. Urban cemeteries constitute a unique type of public space: while some may consider them primarily religious and contemplative spaces, others see them as primarily recreational or as heritage sites steeped in history. The authors examine the extent to which the pressure on cities' open green areas combined with influences from intercultural encounters is mirrored in the use and character of cemeteries today - exemplified by Gamlebyen Cemetery (Gamlebyen Gravlund) in Oslo, Norway. They used observations in combination with short semi-structured interviews with those using the cemetery. The findings of pilot study conducted in 2013 suggest that religious aspects played a minor role and that the recreational aspects were more important to most of the interviewees. Many of them considered that the cemetery provided a pleasant green walkway on their way to work, busses or city services. The cemetery offered a combination of calmness, an aesthetically pleasant environment, and 'cultivated nature' in an urban context, and was thus an arena that invited respect and esteem.

AB  - There are different studies that point out that the price of electricity is a fundamental factor that will influence the mining decision, due to the cost it represents. There is also an ongoing debate about the pollution generated by cryptocurrency mining, and whether or not the use of renewable energies will solve the problem of its sustainability. In our study, starting from the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), we have considered several determinants of cryptocurrency mining: energy price, how that energy is generated, temperature, legal constraints, human capital, and R&D&I. From this, via linear regression, we recalculated this EPI by including the above factors that affect cryptocurrency mining in a sustainable way. The study determines, once the EPI has been readjusted, that the most sustainable countries to perform cryptocurrency mining are Denmark and Germany. In fact, of the top ten countries eight of them are European (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, and the United Kingdom); and the remaining two are Asian (South Korea and Japan).

AB  - Road hazard perception is considered the most prominent higher-order cognitive skill related to traffic-accident involvement. Regional cultures and social rules that govern acceptable behavior may influence drivers' interpretation of a traffic situation and, consequently, the correct identification of potentially hazardous situations. Here, we aimed to compare hazard perception skills among four European countries that differ in their traffic culture, policies to reduce traffic risks, and fatal crashes: Ukraine, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. We developed a static hazard perception test in which driving scenes with different levels of braking affordance were presented while drivers' gaze was recorded. The test required drivers to indicate the action they would undertake: to brake vs. to keep driving. We assessed 218 young adult drivers. Multilevel models revealed that the scenes' levels of braking affordance (i.e., road hazard) modulated drivers' behavior. As the levels of braking affordance increased, drivers' responses became faster and their gaze entropy decreased (i.e., visual search strategy became less erratic). The country of origin influenced these effects. Ukrainian drivers were the fastest and Swedish drivers were the slowest to respond. For all countries, the decrement in response times was less marked in the case of experienced drivers. Also, Spanish drivers showed the most structured (least erratic) visual search strategy, whereas the Italians had the most rigid (most constant) one. These results suggest that road hazard perception can be defined cross-culturally, with cultural factors (e.g., traffic climate, legislation) modulating response times and visual search strategies. Our results also support the idea that a multimodal assessment methodology is possible for mass testing of road hazard perception and its outcomes would be relevant to understand how different traffic cultures shape driving behavior.

AB  - Wood is a major carbon input into aquatic ecosystems and is thought to decay slowly, yet surprisingly little terrestrial carbon accumulates in marine sediments. A better mechanistic understanding of how habitat conditions and decomposer communities influence wood decay processes along the river-estuary-ocean continuum can address this seeming paradox. We measured mass loss, wood element, and polymer concentrations, quantified invertebrate-induced decay, and sequenced fungal communities associated with replicate sections ofGuazumabranch wood submerged in freshwater, estuarine, and near-shore marine habitats and placed on the soil surface in nearby terrestrial habitats in three watersheds in the tropical eastern Pacific. Over 15 months, we found that wood decayed at similar rates in estuarine, marine, and terrestrial sites, reflecting the combined activity of invertebrate and microbial decomposers. In contrast, in the absence of shipworms (Teredinidae), which accounted for similar to 40% of wood mass loss in the estuarine habitats, decay proceeded more slowly in freshwater. Over the experiment, wood element chemistry diverged among freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats, due to differences in both nutrient losses (e.g., potassium and phosphorus) and gains (e.g., calcium and aluminum) through decay. Similarly, we observed changes in wood polymer content, with the highest losses of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin moieties in the marine habitat. Aquatic fungal communities were strongly dominated by ascomycetes (88-99% of taxa), compared to terrestrial communities (55% ascomycetes). Large differences in fungal diversity were also observed across habitats with threefold higher richness in terrestrial than freshwater habitats and twofold higher diversity in freshwater than estuarine/marine habitats. Divergent decay trajectories across habitats were associated with widespread order-level differences in fungal composition, with distinct communities found in freshwater, estuarine and marine habitats. However, few individual taxa that were significantly associated with mass loss were broadly distributed, suggesting a high level of functional redundancy. The rapid processing of wood entering tropical rivers by microbes and invertebrates, comparable to that on land, indicates that estuaries and coastal oceans are hotspots not just for the processing of particulate and dissolved organic carbon, but also for woody debris and for the breakdown of lignin, the most recalcitrant polymer in plant tissue.

AB  - This paper examines the dynamic effects of forest conservation measures. Both short-term and long-term impacts on timber markets are studied using a Finnish example. Forest conservation is interpreted as an exogenous negative shock in the standing timber growth owned by private forest owners, and its effects are retrieved through an impulse response analysis based on a dynamic demand-supply and timber stock model. The results show that timber markets are influenced by forest conservation. The conservation of forest assets reduces traded quantities and increases timber prices. These effects are of the same relative magnitude, thus leaving the annual timber-selling income of private forest owners unchanged. The results suggest that some of the negative short-run impacts of conservation on commercial timber stock will be compensated in the long run by intensified use of the remaining stock. This may to some extent reduce the ecological usefulness of the conservation policies. While the timber markets converge in the long run towards a new post-conservation state the short-term interruptions suggest that caution should be used in establishing set-asides in privately owned forestland.

AB  - Several studies have shown dense urban structures to be favourable in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport, limit energy consumption in buildings and protect farmland and natural areas in the surroundings of the city. There may, however, be some tensions between such a compact urban developmental strategy and considerations of public health in urban planning. This paper reviews findings from international research on the relationships between urban form and health and illustrates some of these effects by comparing statistics on life expectancy and the frequency of heart attacks among inhabitants of different urban districts in the Norwegian capital Oslo. Since we have only had access to aggregate figures at the level of urban districts, the results must be interpreted with caution. The currently available results do, however, suggest that the densification strategies often recommended for reducing the ecological footprints of cities might be encumbered with some important drawbacks, seen from a public health perspective. Based on the findings, some dilemmas and perspectives for sustainability- and health-oriented urban planning are discussed.

AB  - Energy communication is a relatively new subfield that explores energy's role in society as well as ways of communicating about energy. Because this is such a new subfield, few contexts for energy communication have been studied. The purpose of this paper is to consider energy communication as found in international, digital contexts that have not been examined before, including several genres used in Sweden, Russia, France, the US, and Spain. First, we attempt to determine which aspects of energy's societal role are discussed on four websites belonging to technical Swedish and Russian universities. Second, we look at cultural strategies of influence in French and US energy ad campaigns. Finally, we examine the website of a Spanish-founded multinational energy company using dromology (the study of speed) as our framework to explore the shift to green energy and the inclusion of the arts in energy communication. Future research includes studies of other genres of energy communication in an even wider variety of contexts.

AB  - Assuming better colonization abilities of inferior competitors, the competition-colonization trade-off (CCTO) is one of the hypotheses that explains spatial variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Whereas this mechanism may structure some plant and insect communities, ecologists have failed to document its operation in other natural systems, and its generality has been questioned. We combined fieldwork and published data to study the composition of a guild of passerines (Parus cristatus, Parus montanus, Parus ater and Regulus regulus) inhabiting 10 landscapes that differed in the amount of forest habitat. The species were ordered in a stable, well-defined competitive hierarchy, and the dispersal ability of each species was inversely correlated with its position in this hierarchy. In functionally continuous landscapes, superior competitors occupied most fragments and all guild members commonly occurred. The relative incidences of superior and inferior competitors were reversed, and differences amplified, in landscapes where patches were physically (distance) or functionally (matrix hardness) isolated. We found little support for two competing hypotheses, namely reduced habitat quality in isolated patches and lower abundance of a keystone predator (Glaucidium passerinum) in fragmented landscapes. We concluded that the CCTO offered the most probable explanation for variation in the composition of the Parus guild across landscapes.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine, from a cultural and social perspective, the Norwegian urban areas and everyday situations in Jan Erik Vold's (b. 1939) poems. Our close-reading technique reveals important social aspects, different places and streets, located in the capital city of Norway, Oslo. These urban poems written by the contemporary Norwegian poet Jan Erik Vold contribute to the reconstruction of a new Norwegian cultural identity as it is reflected in a selection of poems taken from Mor Godhjertas glade versjon. Ja (Mother Goodhearted's Happy Version. Yes, 1968), followed by the poet's wanderings in the city of Oslo in En som het Abel Ek (One Named Abel Ek, 1988), and concluding with his bitter social criticism in Elg (Moose, 1989) and IKKE. Skillingstrykk fra nittitallet (Not: Broadsides from the Nineties, 1993). Vold's urban poems emphasise the transition from nyenkle (new simple), friendly and descriptive poems which present closely the city of Oslo on foot, to short, political and social critical poems from the 90s. Thus, it is of great importance to traverse various urban 'landscapes' in different periods of time, beginning with the 1960s, followed by the 80s and the 90s.

The landscape perceptions of two professional management regimes are used Lis platforms to gain a wider understanding of worldviews in relation to the 'utmark' environment. The landscape orders are based oil a landscape cosmology of prehistoric origin, but which modern versions are scaled differently, mirroring changes of worldviews. One management oil the other superimposes ail extreme dissonance of inferiority between contradictive landscapes aesthetics.

AB  - In this article, we analyse tensions in Sami local communities meeting new industrial development. Indigenous communities experience outmigration and are in need of new business development and employment. Global extractive companies may offer new jobs, but the type and scale of these jobs put pressure on traditional indigenous livelihoods. The study underlines the importance of two core ideal type Sami positions - traditionalist and modernist - on future industrial development in rural Sami areas in Norway. These positions are playing themselves out in different ways by the most important Sami institutions; The Sami Parliament (Samediggi), The Finnmark Estate (FeFo) and Sami-populated municipalities. The result is a deep-going institutional conflict around industrial development, making it very difficult to find compromises. To shed light on these conflicts and their implications, we analyse how different positions are institutionally visible in the ongoing battle concerning the Nussir mining case in the Sami municipality Kvalsund in Northern Norway.

AB  - Emergency medicine (EM) in most of Europe is a much newer specialty than in the United States. Until recently, emergency departments (EDs) in Norway were staffed with unsupervised interns, leading to a government report in 2008 that called for change. From the establishment of the Norwegian Society for Emergency Medicine in 2010 to the creation of the specialty in 2017 and the approval of the first emergency physician in Norway in 2019, our review article describes how a small group of physicians were able to work with politicians and the media to get an emergency medicine specialty approved despite resistance from a much larger group of existing specialists. Norway faced many of the same obstacles as the United States did with implementing the specialty 60 years ago. This article serves as a review of the conflict that may ensue when enacting a change in public policy and a resource to those countries that have yet to implement an emergency medicine specialty.

AB  - Claims for ocean space are growing while marine ecosystems suffer from centuries of insufficient care. Human pressures from runoff, atmospheric emissions, marine pollution, fishing, shipping, military operations and other activities wear on habitats and populations. Ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a strategic instrument for handling conflicting spatial claims among competing sectors and the environment. The twofold objective of both boosting the blue economy and protecting the environment is challenging in practice and marine planners need decision support. Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) was originally developed to provide an overview of the human imprint on the world's ocean ecosystems. We have now added a scenario component to the CIA model and used it within Swedish ecosystem-based MSP. This has allowed us to project environmental impacts for different planning alternatives throughout the planning process, strengthening the integration of environmental considerations into strategic decision-making. Every MSP decision may entail a local shift of environmental impact, causing positive or negative consequences for ecosystem components. The results from Swedish MSP in the North Sea and Baltic Sea illustrate that MSP certainly has the potential to lower net cumulative environmental impact, both locally and across sea basins, as long as environmental values are rated high and prevailing pressures derive from activities that are part of MSP. By synthesizing innumerous data into comprehensible decision support that informs marine planners of the likely environmental consequences of different options, CIA enables ecosystem-based MSP in practice.

AB  - As a primary industry, agriculture is directly dependent on natural conditions and therefore potentially vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. In Norway and Northern Norway in particular, the future climatic changes are expected to be overall positive. Still, the consequences for agriculture are not straightforward, but dependent on the interaction between different weather and biological elements, as well as political, economic and social conditions. In this interdisciplinary study we have assessed biological and agronomic effects of climate change, and their interaction with political, economic and social factors, to identify farmers' vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change. The assessments are based on downscaled climate change scenarios and interviews with local farmers in the three northernmost counties in Northern Norway (latitude 65.5 degrees to 70 degrees). The study shows that the farmers to a degree are vulnerable to a changing climate, not mainly because of the direct effects of changing growing conditions, but because these changes are an added factor to an already tenuous situation created by Norwegian agricultural policy and socio-economic development in general. We have found that farmers are highly adaptive, to both changing growing conditions and changing agricultural policies. However, changes in policy are currently a greater challenge to farmers than climate change, and such changes are therefore a more salient driver of vulnerability.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - A CHALLENGE TO FORESTRY POLICY IN THE 1990S
T2  - PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER
LA  - Finnish
AB  - The aim of sustainable development of natural resources is to secure national prosperity in all its different forms without reducing the benefits derived from the environment.  Finland has adopted this long-term approach to the exploitation of forest resources since the 1920s.  Forestry has centuries of tradition in using different sustainability concepts as the basis for forestry policy, explains Professor Matti Palo in the article on pages 21-25.
   The idea of sustainable forestry can be interpreted in different ways.  At a superficial level, forestry is sustainable when there is no decline in the area of land devoted to growing forest.  It can also be taken to mean no decline in the volume of wood felled, the growing stock of trees, income from forestry or in the properties of forest ecosystems.
   In terms of forest growth and age-class distribution, the scope for felling in Finland's forests is growing at an almost unbelievably fast rate.  Even if forest damage due to air pollution, etc.  were to increase, the supply of wood needed to meet the forest industry investments of the 1990s looks secure.

AB  - Forested soils are being increasingly transformed to agricultural fields in response to growing demands for food crop. This modification of the land use is known to result in deterioration of soil properties, in particular its fertility. To reduce the impact of the human activities and mitigate their effects on the soil, it is important to understand the factors responsible for the modification of soil properties. In this paper we reviewed the principal processes affecting soil quality during land use changes, focusing in particular on the effect of soil moisture dynamics on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. Both physical and biological processes, including degradation of litter and humus, and soil moisture evolution at the diurnal and seasonal time scales were considered, highlighting the impact of hydroclimatic variability on nutrient turnover along with the consequences of land use changes from forest to agricultural soil and vice-versa. In order to identify to what extent different models are suitable for long-term predictions of soil turnover, and to understand whether some simulators are more suited to specific environmental conditions or ecosystems, we enumerated the principal features of the most popular existing models dealing with C and N turnover. Among these models, we considered in detail a mechanistic compartment-based model. To show the capabilities of the model and to demonstrate how it can be used as a predictive tool to forecast the effects of land use changes on C and N dynamics, four different scenarios were studied, intertwining two different climate conditions (with and without seasonality) with two contrasting soils having physical properties that are representative of forest and agricultural soils. The model incorporates synthetic time series of stochastic precipitation, and therefore soil moisture evolution through time. Our main findings in simulating these scenarios are that (1) forest soils have higher concentrations of C and N than agricultural soils as a result of higher litter decomposition; (2) high frequency changes in water saturations under seasonal climate scenarios are commensurate with C and N concentrations in agricultural soils; and (3) due to their different physical properties, forest soils attenuate the seasonal climate-induced frequency changes in water saturation, with accompanying changes in C and N concentrations. The model was shown to be capable of simulating the long term effects of modified physical properties of agricultural soils, being thus a promising tool to predict future consequences of practices affecting sustainable agriculture, such as tillage (leading to erosion), ploughing, harvesting, irrigation and fertilization, leading to C and N turnover changes and in consequence, in terms of agriculture production.

AB  - Over the last hundred years, many large carnivore species have suffered range contractions, population losses, and habitat alterations that may be influencing their dietary preferences. To identify shifting isotopic niches and reconstruct past and present diets from species of high conservation concern, stable isotope analysis (SIA) of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of tissue from museum collections and ongoing non-invasive monitoring programs offers an effective approach. Here, we assessed the long-term alterations in the trophic structure of a generalist large carnivore over a time of population loss and recovery. Wolverine stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes were measured in hair samples collected from 44 individuals in Finland for the period 1905-2020, and potential dietary were quantified using isotopic niche metrics shifts in two study areas. We provide evidence of a long-term diet shift in Finnish wolverines, with a temporal depletion of hair's delta C-13 (beta = -0.016 parts per thousand, R-2 = 0.46, p < 0.001). Correspondingly, there was a shift in the isotopic niches of the Historical population (before the year 2000) and Recent population (after 2000), with the niche overlap between the Historical and Recent periods being only 33% throughout Finland, and even lower in the two study areas (22% to 24%). The breadth of the isotopic niche, however, did not significantly differ between the two periods, suggesting that despite a change in diet composition, wolverines did not specialize more. The trophic level of wolverines in Finland was stable throughout the study period, with no significant change in delta N-15 with time (beta = 0.0055 parts per thousand, R-2 = 0.043, p = 0.17). In summary: A) the strong trophic resilience of this top predator was shown by the stability of its niche breadth and trophic level feeding regime during periods of population decline and recovery as well as during a period of major anthropogenic alterations in their environment; B) the use of SIA methods on historical and recent hairs provided a unique tool to unravel long-term changes in wolverine feeding strategies.

AB  - This article analyses the legal adaptive capacity for increasing sustainable fish aquaculture production in EU-Finland. Currently, fish aquaculture is driven by increasing global demand of fish, declining natural fisheries, food security and blue growth policies. At the same time, environmental policies such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive set tightening legal-ecological requirements for the industry's nutrient emissions. Against this background, the success of blue growth policies related to aquaculture - and the hope of reconciling competing interests at sea - boil down to measures available for dealing with excess nutrients. In line with the mitigation hierarchy, the article establishes four alternative pathways for the fish aquaculture industry to grow without increasing its environmental nutrient footprint significantly, and evaluates the legal adaptive capacity and the legal risks attached to these pathways.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of how energy crop cultivations in Sweden, consisting of short-rotation forest (Salix) and energy grass (reed canary grass), can be located and managed to maximise environmental benefits. The overall conclusion is that substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by the use of fertilisers and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils? which also leads to increased soil fertility. Nutrient leaching could be reduced by using energy crop cultivations as buffer strips along open streams and wind erosion could be reduced by using Salix plantations as shelter belts. Cultivation of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal waste, such as waste water, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge. Furthermore, the content of heavy metals in the soil can be reduced through Salix cultivation. The biodiversity is estimated to be almost unchanged, or slightly increased in open farmland. These environmental benefits, which could be achieved on up to 60% of current Swedish arable land and last for 25 years or more, will increase the value of the energy crops. The economic value of these benefits is calculated in Part II of the analysis, which is presented in a second paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the main goals of marine spatial management is to promote a sustainable use of marine resources without putting biodiversity and habitats at risk.
   Environmental status assessments of benthic habitats have traditionally been conducted on soft bottom infauna communities. These communities represent only a limited part of the total diversity of seabed environments. Large and habitat forming organisms that are particularly vulnerable to physical disturbance of the seabed are in general associated with mixed or hard substrates. Together with mobile benthos these large organisms have been poorly mapped with the traditional approach. In accordance with a demand for information on all aspects of benthic habitats there is an increasing interest in a broader mapping approach for assessments of the distribution and status of benthos.
   This has led to an increased demand for a broader mapping approach for assessments of the distribution and status of benthos to include as many habitats as possible.
   We present mapping strategies based on literature together with perspectives from Norway's MAREANO Mapping Programme (www.mareano.no). A first and important step is to acquire high resolution topographical information from multibeam echosounder surveys. Building upon this baseline data set, video inspection along transects can provide information about how megafauna and surface sediments relate to local and broad scale topographical features. Classification of habitats/biotopes can be carried out through the analysis of the megafauna composition and its relation to environmental variables such as depth, quantitative terrain descriptors, and substrates. Marine landscapes have several definitions but generally refer to the major features delimiting broad-scale habitats. Each landscape will include different substrates that can be subdivided into smaller biotopes with specific fauna composition, functionality and production. For these habitats and biotopes information from all sampling gears can then be used to describe a more complete community composition.
   Experience from recent seafloor mapping indicates that a broad approach is required to support evidence-based policy and management of benthic species, communities and habitats. The approach presented can be used to identify biologically valuable areas and assess health status for bottom habitats/biotopes in a broad set of marine (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal zone management requires reliable and tangible spatial information as basis. The marine coast of most of Finland is especially fragmented due to the curved shoreline and the presence of wide archipelago belts with tens of thousands of islands of variable sizes. We present here how G IS analysis can be used to produce such spatial data sets that have direct use value for the coastal stakeholders, planners and decision-makers. Tailored products applying the existing data resources as basis enable the making of holistic regional models and also allow the zooming in when details of individual shores should be seen. In this presentation we focus particularly on the modelling of the neighbour influences of buildings (summer cottages) and other anthropogenic structures in the coastal zone, as these are in the front of the shore development often inducing disagreements among the different stakeholder groups in the coastal areas. We have developed a unique GIS based work chain to produce data on shore occupation on a regular basis. This methodology helps the coastal managers to see what is happening over the times at wide spatial extensions. We furthermore reinforce the potential of online map and other information services in the internet, contributing the dissemination of coastal information for anyone interested.

AB  - Relying on accident records as the main data source for studying cyclists' safety has many drawbacks, such as high degree of under-reporting, the lack of accident details and particularly of information about the interaction processes that led to the accident. It is also an ethical problem as one has to wait for accidents to happen in order to make a statement about cyclists' (un-)safety. In this perspective, the use of surrogate safety measures based on actual observations in traffic is very promising. In this study we used video data from three intersections in Norway that were all independently analysed using three methOds: the Swedish traffic conflict technique (Swedish TCT), the Dutch conflict technique (DOCTOR) and the probabilistic surrogate measures of safety (PSMS) technique developed in Canada. The first two methods are based on manual detection and counting of critical events in traffic (traffic conflicts), while the third considers probabilities of multiple trajectories for each interaction and delivers a density map of potential collision points per site. Due to extensive use of microscopic data, PSMS technique relies heavily on automated tracking of the road users in video. Across the three sites, the methods show similarities or are at least "compatible" with the accident records. The two conflict techniques agree quite well for the number, type and location of conflicts, but some differences with no obvious explanation are also found. PSMS reports many more safety-relevant interactions including less severe events. The location of the potential collision points is compatible with what the conflict techniques suggest, but the possibly significant share of false alarms due to inaccurate trajectories extracted from video complicates the cdmparison. The tested techniques still require enhancement, with respect to better adjustment to analySis of the situations involving cyclists (and vulnerable road users in general) and further validation. However, we believe this to be a future direction for the road safety analysis as the number of accidents is constantly decreasing and the quality of accident data does not seem to improve.

AB  - Geology is a core component of two major multidisciplinary seabed-mapping initiatives in Norway (MAREANO, Marine Base Maps for the Coastal Zone). Helped by Norway's Nature Diversity Act, which acknowledges geological and landscape diversity alongside biodiversity, geological infor-mation has gained recognition nationally as part of an essential foundation for knowledge-based management, both in the coastal zone and offshore. Recently, international focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals has led to the proposal of Essential Geodiversity Variables, a framework for geological (geodiversity) information, intended to stand alongside Essential Vari-ables already defined for climate, biodiversity and oceans (limited to ocean physics, biochemistry, biology and ecosystems). Here, we examine to what extent map products from the Geological Sur-vey of Norway generated under these multidisciplinary mapping initiatives fit within this framework of Essential Geodiversity Variables, and how well it is suited to information on marine geodiversity. Although we conclude that the framework is generally a good fit for the marine-relevant Essential Geodiversity Variable classes (geology and geomorphology), we examine opportunities for further highlighting quantitative geodiversity information. We present preliminary examples of substrate diversity and morphological diversity and discuss our experience of geological mapping as part of multidisciplinary initiatives. We highlight many benefits, which far outweigh any perceived or real compromises of this approach in monetary, practical and scientific terms.

AB  - Second homes are an integral part of leisure history in many developed countries. They are also increasingly popular in modern societies. While the material well-being of home and work has increased, man.), people increasingly seek simpler life forms. An essential motive to use and purchase a second home is the landscape. This article explores the concept Of second-home landscape on the basis of contemporary research and a case study of second home owners in the Finnish Lakeland. Attributable to theories of human geography, three prominent approaches of second-home landscape are distinguished: physical, experiential and cultural. The case study illustrates that these are not mutually exclusive, but the landscape has many faces. Even if the physical attributes form the solid basis for the second-home landscape, it does not exist independentally of perception. It is produced through the everyday practices of people, which are adjusted to social and cultural discourses. In the strain of modern society, second-home landscape is often perceived as an ideal habitat. It, however, is in constant change in relation to time and space so that future generations, inheritors and buyers of the cottages will have their say in the contexts in which the landscape is interpreted.

AB  - Conventional agricultural practices can lead to soil erosion and a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) content. It has been suggested that less intensive agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage (including no-till and reduced till without soil inversion) may reduce both erosion and loss of SOC. The aim of this study was to determine whether, and why, conservation tillage is used in Scania, which is one of the most agro-intensive regions in Sweden. We also investigated how information on tillage practices is obtained, why one type of tillage may be favored over another, and whether some farmers are more likely to use conservation tillage. The result of this study will benefit policy makers and researchers by pinpointing factors that influence the use of conservation tillage. To collect data, a questionnaire was sent to farmers in Scania in 2016. We found that the majority of the responding farmers used conservation tillage, and that it was more likely to be used if the farmer was highly educated and spent more than 50% of their annual working time on crop production. The use of conservation tillage was also more common if the farm was large and clay soil dominated. Crop rotation was often highlighted as the most important factor influencing the choice of tillage practice, which may be due to crop species requirements. When asked to compare the consequences of reduced tillage and plowing, the perception of farmers using conservation tillage was in general more positive, indicating skepticism toward the practice of reduced tillage until it had been tried. We show that the use of conservation tillage, sometimes in combination with plowing, is widespread in Scania. However, unless changes in, for example, crop rotation and labor requirements occur, the use of conservation tillage will most likely remain the same as today, or only increase slightly in the near future. Farm enlargement may result in an increased conservation tillage use, and so may efforts to educate advisors, increased opportunities for peer-to-peer meetings, and the development of economically viable small farm solutions. Increased conservation tillage may be part of the solution for sustainable crop production, but drawbacks such as increased pesticide use must be addressed further, as well as factors such as crop rotation development and practical knowledge that influence conservation tillage use at the farm level.

AB  - Extreme weather events can be expected to increase in frequency in the future. Our knowledge on how this may affect species persistence is, however, very limited. For reliable projections of future persistence we need to understand how extreme weather affects species' population dynamics.
   We analysed the effect of extreme droughts on the host plant Succisa pratensis, colonization-extinction dynamics, and future persistence of the threatened marsh fritillary Euphydryas aurinia. Specifically, we studied a metapopulation inhabiting a network of 256 patches on Gotland (Sweden), where the summer of 2018 was the driest ever recorded. We analysed how the frequency and leaf size of host plants changed between 2017 and 2019, based on 6,833 records in 0.5-m(2) sample plots. Using turnover data on the butterfly from 2018 to 2019 we modelled local extinction and colonization probabilities. Moreover, we projected future population dynamics with an increasing frequency of extreme years under three different management strategies that regulate the grazing regime.
   Our results show a substantial decrease in both frequency (46%) and size (20%) of host plants due to the drought, which taken together may constitute a 57% loss of food resources. The butterfly occupancy decreased by over 30% between 2018 and 2019 (from 0.36 to 0.27). The extinction probability increased with increasing 'effective area' of the patch (taking quality reduction due to grazing into account), and the colonization probability increased with increasing connectivity and ground moisture.
   Projections of future dynamics showed an increasing risk of metapopulation extinction with increasing frequency of years with extreme droughts. The risk, however, clearly differed between management strategies. Less grazing in years with droughts decreased the extinction risk considerably.
   Synthesis and applications. Extreme weather events can have profound negative impacts on butterflies and their host plants. For the marsh fritillary, an increased frequency of extreme droughts can lead to extinction of the entire metapopulation, even in a large and seemingly viable metapopulation. Increased grazing, due to fodder deficiency in dry years, may lead to cascading negative effects, while active management that reduce grazing in years with droughts can almost completely mitigate these effects.

AB  - Increasing climate change impacts are a major threat to sustainable urban development, and challenge current governance structures, including actors' responsibilities for dealing with climate variability and extremes. The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing adaptation interactions' and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens - to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk - requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and responsibilisation'; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The ability to effectively resolve complex environmental problems hinges upon the capacity to address several different challenges in concert. These challenges, what we refer to as policy issues, often relate to one another - they interdepend. Policy issue interdependency has been extensively theorised in the literature, yet few methodological approaches and little empirical evidence exist to translate the concept of policy issue interdependency to the on-the-ground realities facing policy actors in specific cases and contexts. We build from previous studies to develop a methodological procedure that investigates policy issue interdependencies in ways that take into account what measures and possible solutions policy actors have at their disposal in specific cases for specific environmental problems. By applying our methodological procedure to a case of water governance in Sweden, four insights emerged. First, validation by stakeholders confirms that our procedure produces reliable results. Second, we find that many, but certainly not all, policy issues are interdependent. More specifically, different patterns of policy issue interdependencies are associated with the biophysical and the governance spheres, respectively. Third, our results suggest that policy issue interdependencies are most important to consider when the overall level of interdependency is moderate. Last, our study raises new questions about policy actors' perception of policy issue interdependencies. In particular, a key question for future research would be if reinforcing (win-win) or counteracting (trade-off) interdependencies are easier to comprehend and act on for policy actors.

AB  - Extreme weather-related events are likely to increase in both frequency and intensity if current emission rates continue. Particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of climate change is the transportation sector, which fully relies on the uninterrupted accessibility of the road network. With the Swedish Government adopting a National Adaptation Strategy in 2018, creating a coordinated cross-disciplinary strategy underpinned by international frameworks, new ambition levels regarding climate change adaptation efforts have been established. Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories from upcoming IPCC reports.

AB  - Railway noise is expected to increase in Europe and Sweden as well, following recommendations for a more sustainable transportation mode. This forecasted increase might lead to higher level of noise exposure, higher population exposure and potentially increased night-time exposure. Evidence supports an effect of transportation noise on several health outcomes, including metabolic conditions such as diabetes. However, few studies were directed to railway noise; present studies on railway noise and diabetes so far show ambiguous results while some studies report an association between railway noise and obesity. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between railway noise and diabetes prevalence and to assess whether obesity might be a mediator in this association. The study population (N = 5381) was randomly selected from residents living within 1 km of a trafficked railway in Va center dot stra Go center dot taland, Sweden. Survey data was combined with modelled exposures and health register data (ICD10 codes for diabetes). The study uses a cross sectional design, logistic regression analysis and a counterfactual mediation analysis. We found an increase in the prevalence of diabetes associated with the exposure to railway noise: OR = 1.33 per 10 dB increase Lden (95% CI 1.09-1.63) accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. BMI and waist circumference partially mediate the association between railway noise and diabetes. This is the first study to report an association between railway noise and diabetes in Sweden. BMI and waist circumference seem to be a potential mediators in this association. Still, future studies should further explore the mechanisms from noise to diabetes, considering different pathways in relation to obesity but also exploring other potential mediators.

AB  - Tree stump harvesting could significantly increase the amount of bioenergy feedstock that forestry can supply to substitute for fossil alternatives. However, the climate mitigation potential of using stumps for bioenergy has been debated due to their often long residence time in the forest caused by slow decomposition. This study evaluated the climate effect over time of utilising stumps for bioenergy using ecosystem forest carbon modelling and time-dependent LCA methodology, including uncertainties in soil carbon changes. Different climate impact metrics were used (global mean temperature change, global warming potential and cumulative radiative forcing) and evaluations were made for single harvest as well as continuous supply over a landscape. Stump harvesting scenarios for spruce forests across Sweden were simulated and the forest net carbon balance was estimated as the difference compared with a reference scenario where the stumps were left to decompose in the forest.
   The results showed that using stump residues from commercial forestry in Sweden gives a climate benefit when they substitute for fossil fuel, even in a shorter perspective of around two decades. The temperature impact from using stumps for bioenergy at the stand level peaked after 10-15 years and then declined steadily to similar to 15% of the maximum level during the following 4-5 decades. The remaining long-term climate impact was small compared to using fossil fuel. An immediate climate benefit was achieved when replacing fossil coal, whereas the parity time, i.e. the time to reach climate benefit was 12-16 years (+/-2 years) when replacing natural gas, depending on geographical location. For continuous supply of stump bioenergy over a landscape, the corresponding parity time was 22-28 years. There was a higher impact on global climate for northern Sweden, although the absolute difference was small. Sensitivity analysis indicated a moderate additional climate warming effect from the soil disturbance caused by stump harvesting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increased bioenergy demand has triggered a discussion on the sustainability of solid biomass-based fuels and a system for sustainability criteria has been discussed within the EU. This paper assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for heat and electricity from selected wood pellet value chains for the Swedish market and the associated potential emissions reduction in relation to fossil fuels using a life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective, and in relation to the approach described in recent EU policy developments. Nine different wood pellet value chains for heat and/or power production in Sweden are assessed (including pellets from Sweden, Latvia, Russia, and Canada). Selected assumptions are varied in a sensitivity analysis. The total factory-gate GHG emissions at the conversion facility for the wood pellet value chains studied, range between 2 and 25 g CO2-eq/MJ pellets with Swedish pellets at the lower end, and Russian pellets using natural gas for drying the raw material at the higher end. Imported pellets from Latvia, Russia, and Canada that use biomass for drying may also reach relatively low levels of GHG emissions. The potential GHG reduction as compared to a certain fossil fuel default energy comparator is 64-98% for the electricity produced in the pellet value chains studied and 77-99% for the heat produced. Thus, many wood pellet value chains on the Swedish market will most likely be able to meet strict demands for sustainability from a GHG perspective.

AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) provides financial compensation to land owners who avoid converting standing forests to other land uses. In this paper, we review the main opportunities and challenges for REDD+ implementation, including expectations for REDD+ to deliver on multiple environmental and societal cobenefits. We also highlight a recent case study, the Norway-Indonesia REDD+ agreement and discuss how it might be a harbinger of outcomes in other forest-rich nations seeking REDD+ funds. Looking forward, we critically examine the fundamental assumptions of REDD+ as a solution for the atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gas emissions and tropical deforestation. We conclude that REDD+ is currently the most promising mechanism driving the conservation of tropical forests. Yet, to emerge as a true game changer, REDD+ must still demonstrate that it can access low transaction cost and high-volume carbon markets or funds, while also providing or complimenting a suite of nonmonetary incentives to encourage a developing nation's transition from forest losing to forest gaining, and align with, not undermine, a globally cohesive attempt to mitigate anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Urban mobility is one of the main issues in the pursuit of sustainability. The United Nations 2030 Agenda assigns mobility and transport central roles in sustainable development and its components: economic, social, and environment. In this context, the emerging concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offers an alternative to unsustainable mobility, often based on private car use. From the point of view of sustainable mobility, the MaaS paradigm implies greater insights into the transport system and its components (supply, demand, and reciprocal interactions). This paper proposes an approach to the transport system aimed at overcoming the current barriers to the implementation of the paradigm. The focus is on the implications for the transport supply subsystem. The investigation method is based on the analysis of the main components of such subsystem (governance, immaterial, material, equipment) and its role in the entire transport system. Starting with the first experiences of Finnish cities, the paper investigates some real case studies, which are experimenting with MaaS, to find common and uncommon elements. From the analyses, it emerges that the scientific literature and real experiences mainly focus on the immaterial components alone. To address the challenges related to sustainable mobility, this paper underlines the need to consider all components within a transport system approach. The findings of the paper are useful in several contexts. In the context of research, the paper offers an analysis of the transport supply system from the point of view of the MaaS paradigm. In the real context, the paper offers further useful insights for operators and decision-makers who intend to increase the knowledge and skills necessary to face challenges related to the introduction of MaaS.

AB  - The move towards a climate neutral economy and society requires policymakers and practitioners to carefully consider the core technical, social, and spatial dimensions of a just transition. This paper closely examines the processes undertaken during the development of EU Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTPs) for the three Swedish regions of Gotland, Norrbotten, and Vastra Gotaland. The aim is to establish whether the content and actions outlined in the TJTPs were driven by the technical, social, or spatial dimensions of a just transition. The analysis is primarily based on a socio-economic and governance impact assessment conducted in each region as part of the TJTP formulation process. These data are also supported by observations of the TJTP development process by the article authors who were part of the team put together by DG Reform to work with the preparation of the TJTPs. The paper finds that the TJTPs development process was largely driven by technical considerations, rather than spatial and socio-economic issues. This indicates that a more open and inclusive place-based territorial approach to climate transition policy formulation and implementation is required. A balance between the technical, social, and spatial elements of a just transition is needed if policies are going to meet the requirements of local and regional citizens and provide sustainable socio-economic growth and environmental protection, without risks of delocalizing energy-intensive processes to other regions.

AB  - The presented study investigates the evolution of artificial gravel placements for Atlantic salmon and sea trout in Aurlandselva in Western Norway. Various monitoring methods have been applied including (i) quantifying the spatial extent and dynamics of spawning sites over the monitoring period, (ii) grain size distributions as well as (iii) applying numerical hydraulic and sediment transport modelling with the aim to test the predictability of such numerical tools. The spawning sites were not clogged by fine sediments, but were reshaped due to scouring and sediment transport. The scouring resulted in a volume loss of the gravel banks between 32 and 95% in the monitoring period of 5 years. The application of hydrodynamic-numerical modelling, however, showed that the modelling methods were not sufficient to predict erosion of the gravel or the site. The study showed that the areas are sensitive especially to local scale micro-topographical roughness elements. The complex three-dimensional hydraulic processes and the coarse substrate in the non-fluvial river environment makes it impracticable for multi-dimensional modelling to predict dynamics of gravel. A novel sediment criterion was introduced to estimate the near-bottom turbulence by relating the d(m) of introduced gravel compared to the d(90) of the bed surface substrate composition.

AB  - North-European decision-support service providers have been advised to look beyond wood production to respond to the diverse needs of forest owners, to maximise business opportunities and to fulfil the pluralist goals of society. However, change in the service sector has remained limited to date. Here, we applied a mixed-method critical discourse analysis to examine whether the discourses produced by Finnish forest owners (n=12) and consulting professionals (n=12) recognise the need for decision-support services that deviate from current production-centred thinking and promote more sustainable forest use.We identified four discourses of service development. The juggling discourse welcomed new service innovations for sustainable forestry on condition that these continue to support high-quality forestry and are in demand by forest owners. In the productivist discourse, a strong focus on wood production has made it impossible to envisage any reason for change. The loyal discourse, produced only by forest owners, was more open to change but was still satisfied with the existing services. Together, these three discourses ensured a service interaction that effectively excluded all forest-related contradictions and sustained the production-centred business-as-usual approach. The environmentally focused critical discourse advised that decision-support services should adopt a strong sustain -ability view that highlights human responsibility for nature, although these ideas remained outside of everyday service interactions.Our results illustrated that the current discursive conditions effectively suppress any ideas that deviate from production-centred thinking within the mainstream decision-support services provided to Finnish forest owners. To facilitate change, service providers require concrete and economically attractive best practice examples of new service products that follow a strong-sustainability view.

AB  - Large carnivores are controversial species, and associated conflicts between stakeholders with opposing views on large carnivores are observed across the globe. Social trust, the public's willingness to rely on those responsible for developing policies, has gained much attention regarding the acceptance of large carnivores and large carnivore management. However, trust in large carnivore science has not received as much consideration. In Norway, administrative management authorities are responsible to execute the political framework decided by the Norwegian Parliament while basing their decisions on recommendations from large carnivore science. As large carnivore science is the main knowledge provider for monitoring and measures implemented in management decisions to achieve viable carnivore populations, trust in science is crucial. Yet, scientific information is often challenged. As attitude studies show a tendency for the wider general public to be more positive towards large carnivores than people most adversely affected, we wanted to examine whether the trust in large carnivore science follows the same pattern. We used a geographically stratified sample of 2110 respondents, five respondents from each municipality in Norway, to model how trust varies across the sample. Our results indicate that elderly men, people with lower education, those who have experienced loss of livestock to carnivores associate with lower trust in large carnivore science. Lower trust was also found among big game hunters and people who fear large carnivores. This knowledge could help to guide targeted science communication and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cognitions important for management of conflicts involving large carnivores.

AB  - We here report the first sign of amphibian recovery after a strong decline due to acidic precipitation over many decades and peaking around 1980-90. In 2010, the pH level of ponds and small lakes in two heavily acidified areas in southwestern Scandinavia (Aust-Agder and stfold in Norway) had risen significantly at an (arithmetic) average of 0.14 since 1988-89. Parallel with the general rise in pH, amphibians (Rana temporaria, R. arvalis, Bufo bufo, Lissotriton vulgaris, and Triturus cristatus) had become significantly more common: the frequency of amphibian localities rose from 33% to 49% (n = 115), and the average number of amphibian species per locality had risen from 0.51 to 0.88. In two other (reference) areas, one with better buffering capacity (Telemark, n = 21) and the other with much less input of acidic precipitation (Nord-Trondelag, n = 106), there were no significant changes in pH or amphibians.

AB  - While many studies provide microscale relationships between fish and habitat characteristics, studies covering longer river reaches are scarce. Modern remote sensing techniques may enable new and effective ways of mapping and assessing mesoscale habitat characteristics. Using green LIDAR-derived bathymetry and hydraulic modelling, we tested how mesoscale depth and velocity were related to fish counts of adult European grayling (Thymallus thymallus L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in 500 m river sections in three separate periods during the year. Using riverbank sinuosity from aerial images and a Froude number-based index from the hydraulic model as proxies for mesoscale spatial and hydraulic heterogeneity, we tested for temporal correlations with river section fish counts of adult European grayling and brown trout. Results showed that mesoscale mean depth and velocity were correlated to period fish counts of adult European grayling. Using mixed model analysis we found that riverbank sinuosity and the Froude number-based index were significantly correlated with river section occurrence of adult European grayling during spawning. The results can be used to assess how flow-induced changes and channel adjustments at the mesoscale level can influence access to and use of relevant habitats in rivers occupied by European grayling and brown trout.

AB  - Objective: to describe 10 Years of experiences of the Swedish National Bicycle Safety Programme which started during 1990 as part of an initiative taken by the World Health Organization (WHO). In relation to WHO's efforts with regard to accident and injury prevention, a global programme to increase helmet-wearing by two-wheel riders was launched. The idea was to introduce a simple 'vaccine' for everyone that was achievable at a low cost. The Swedish initiative was taken up by the Karolinska Institute and the National Institute of Public Health. Method: at an operational level, all available methods and data sources were utilized in the programme: surveillance of injuries, provision of information and advice, training and supervision, environment and product improvements, and legislation. Results: considerable progress has been made in reducing bicycle-related injuries in Sweden over the last two decades. Cycling injuries among the elderly must be a matter of particular concern. Conclusions: our 10 years of experiences from a bicycle helmet promotion programme lead to the conclusion that there is a case for mandatory helmet wearing, as one of the most important strategies on the national level. But regional and community-based efforts will still need to be more comprehensive. Besides this, efforts must be made to intensify the activities of parties already involved in prevention programmes. New target groups must be approached, such as immigrants, vulnerable social groups, and teenagers. Sustainability of the Swedish Bicycle Helmet Initiative Group, including continued participation of group members and organizations, is the key-in the long term-to protecting Swedish bicyclists against head injuries.

AB  - Participation is seen as an important aspect of sustainable forest management (SFM). Especially important are the policy processes, where the effectiveness of the policy is determined by the commitment of the stakeholders to the selected policy. There are, however, different opinions as to what constitutes a successful participatory process. In this study, we analysed the stakeholder perspectives about proper participation process in Regional Forest Programme preparation in Finland using Q-methodology. We found four different perspectives: pragmatic consensus-seekers, reformers, expertise-oriented actors and participation sceptics. The pragmatists seek for consensus, but purely on traditional forestry issues. The reformers, on the other hand, wanted to introduce other aspects into the process and opposed the dominant position of the traditional forestry network in the RFP process. The expertise-oriented group was ready to discuss different aspects, but wanted to promote the power of experts. The sceptics wanted to allocate the minimum effort to participation. The results suggest that framing and organizing the process, reaching commitment, roles of different information, and the ways of taking into account the views of general public should be emphasized in future RFP's.

AB  - Two-thirds of Europeans currently live in cities, predicted to rise to 80% by 2050. People choose to live in increasingly dense urban areas to gain better education and employment. However, urban living brings a range of environmental challenges and civil engineers need to provide solutions. The European Commission initiated the European Green Capital Award in 2008 to reward cities for environmental performance, sustainability plans and acting as a role model for other cities. This paper describes notable civil engineering features of four of the more recent winning cities: Copenhagen in Denmark, Essen in Germany, Nijmegen in the Netherlands and Oslo in Norway.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have negative impacts but also to bring potential opportunities for agriculture and crop productivity in the Nordic countries. Little research has been conducted at the farmer level to identify what adaptation measures are being considered or already taken and transformative these are. Based on semi-structured interviews with farmers and extension officers from two of the most fertile agricultural areas of Finland and Sweden, this study examines to what extent Nordic farmers are engaged in transforming their farming systems. The results show that some transformational changes are taking place already but most changes are incremental. Currently, agricultural policies and regulations are perceived as a greater adaptation challenge than climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prolongation of the growing season due to a warming climate could represent new opportunities for northern agriculture. Climatic and biotic constraints may, however, together with increasing risk for higher nutrient loads, challenge future crop production. The objective of this study was to speculate how a range of arable land use patterns, resulting from various policy driven choices, could be introduced into a farming system, and how they would affect the risks associated with nutrient leaching. The case study area included 720 ha of arable fields in southern Finland. Climate change scenarios were calculated using averages of 19 climate models and emission scenarios B1, A1B and A2. Four crop choice and allocation storylines were developed according to policy objectives: increased protein self-sufficiency, increased winter cover for reducing nutrient loading, diversification, and monoculture for cereal production. Grasslands and leys were not included in any of the production scenarios. Impacts of these land uses on sediment loading and nitrogen leaching were simulated using WSFS and INCA modelling. We found that while adaptation to climate change must include consideration of crop choices, there are conflicts associated with allocations and rotations for various market and policy situations. The expected increase in nutrient loading in the simulations caused by climate change was moderate. The increase can partly be compensated for by changes in farmland use, more in the shorter term than in the longer term to mid-century. To reduce suspended sediment load in the changed climate, vegetation cover in winter was important. For nitrogen leaching, adjusting the N balance at parcel level was more important than vegetation cover. In the future, adaptation at cropping system level is potentially an efficient way to manage nutrient load risks.

AB  - Power-to-heat solutions like heat pumps and electric boilers are foreseen to be possible future tools to stabilise international power markets with high proportions of variable power supply. Temporary low cost electricity can be used for heat generation at times with high availability of wind and solar power through substitution of ordinary heat supply, hence contributing to increased energy system sustainability. Power-to-heat installations in district heating systems are competitive due to low specific investment and installation costs for large electric boilers, heat pumps, and heat storages. Several large-scale heat pumps were installed in Swedish district heating systems during the 1980s, since a national electricity surplus from new nuclear power existed for some years. The aim of this paper is to summarise the accumulated operation experiences from these large Swedish heat pumps to support and facilitate planning of future power-to-heat solutions with heat pumps in district heating systems. Gained experiences consider; installed capacities, capacity utilisation, heat sources used, refrigerant replacements, refrigerant leakages, and wear of mechanical components. The major conclusion is that many of the large thirty-year-old heat pumps are still in operation, but with reduced capacity utilisation due to internal competition from waste and biomass cogeneration plants in the district heating systems.

AB  - This paper describes the development of Citylab Post-Construction, a Swedish certification system for evaluating the sustainability performance of urban areas in a post-construction phase once the area is inhabited. The process design was based on transdisciplinary and research-through-design approaches, and involved experts and practitioners within Swedish urban planning, real estate and construction sector. This paper is not highlighting the certification system per se, but rather the process of developing it, with the aim of increasing the understanding of such design processes. A previously developed, but so far untested, framework of key considerations for certification systems was used to clarify benefits and drawbacks of different design decisions. The framework was used in all steps of the process, from defining the overall structure, to selecting indicators, formulating detailed requirements and assessing comments of the open consultation of a draft version. The framework of key considerations proved useful in supporting this process, by highlighting conflicts as well as synergies and creating transparency with respect to trade-offs needed between being e.g., scientifically credible but still practical enough. While it is difficult to separate the framework from the process in which it was put to use, we believe that the framework can be supportive also in other processes, both for developing new certification systems or for refining and evaluating existing ones.

AB  - Rapid climate change leads to significant shifts in the site-productivity relationship of tree species and alters abiotic and biotic risks well beyond classical rotation ages on many forest sites worldwide. Forest conversion may be an adequate measure to counter possible negative effects of climate change. Unfortunately, climate-driven changes in abiotic and biotic risks bear a significant source of intrinsic uncertainty inherent in climate projections. It is our goal to appraise uncertainty in species selection under drought stress, one of the most important risk factors for many forests. We derive a method to assess drought restrictions and demonstrate the uncertainty in the process of species selection by applying three climate scenarios. Furthermore, we interpret the consequences of climate uncertainty in the light of different management goals, i.e., a business-as-usual silviculture, a climate protection strategy favoring CO2 sequestration and a biodiversity strategy increasing diversity. The methods are applied to two representative regions in the North German Plain. The results clearly show the strong need for adaptive planning when drought restrictions are considered. However, different silvicultural management objectives may alter the extent of adaptive planning. The uncertainty in the planning process arising from different underlying climate projections strongly depends on the regional site characteristics and on forest management strategy. In conclusion, it is most important in forest planning to clearly state the management goals and to carefully explore if the goals can be met under climate change and if the uncertainty due to climate projections significantly affects the results of species selection.

AB  - Place branding refers to the creation of value in space by reinforcing and representing place assets in a cohesive manner, as a narrative image of the place itself. Such narratives of place are important in planning as well, when developing (strategic) spatial strategies. We argue that place branding and planning can be bridged, through cultural narratives built on local knowledge and the perceived meanings and images of place. However, there is a knowledge gap on how to build cultural narratives in multi-stakeholder processes. While participatory planning methods are increasingly applied, we argue for a greater role of art and arts-based methods. Accordingly, our key question is, how can arts-based methods support the creation of cultural narratives for place branding and planning? To address this question, we outline an approach based on the principles of Appreciative Inquiry. The approach is illustrated through a case study in Finland where we initiated a process of co-creation of place-based narratives. We analyse how the process was organized and facilitated, and what the challenges and lessons learnt were. The paper ends with a discussion, and draws conclusions on the relevance of arts-based methods for the wider debate on place branding and spatial planning.

AB  - We studied the nest site selection and distribution pattern at landscape level of the German Osprey population, and demonstrated how to test the predictions of the ideal free distribution theory and its derivatives on such an expanding population. Information about the location and breeding success of each Osprey nest site between 1995 and 2005 was collected through a long-term monitoring programme. Data of land cover types were acquired from the administrations of each federal state and the CORINE Land Cover database. The results showed that Ospreys preferred landscapes with more water bodies and forests. Such sites were also occupied earlier and had higher local population density. However, in the study period of 11 years, there was a gradual shift from forest-dominated landscapes to agricultural land-dominated landscapes. The breeding success increased over time, with no difference in the breeding success between pairs nesting on trees and poles, whereas there was higher breeding success at nest sites surrounded by more agricultural land and less forest. The more efficient foraging in eutrophic lakes in agricultural landscapes was the most likely cause for the higher breeding success. The distribution pattern of the Ospreys did not match the resource allocation, which deviated from the models tested. We suggested that the proximate cues used for nest site selection mismatched site quality due to anthropogenic environmental changes.

AB  - We develop a general framework in which public goods are conflicting (complementary) if an increase in the provision of one public good raises (lowers) the marginal cost of providing another public good. The framework is used to analyse the policy implications of maintaining safe minimum standards (SMSs) for two public goods. The comparative-static results are illustrated using a sector model for Norwegian agriculture in which the SMSs for food security, agrobiodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions are modelled as constraints. The simulations show that even if public goods are conflicting, better-targeted policies can achieve SMSs at lower social costs.

AB  - As wolf populations expand across Europe, many countries face challenges in finding ways to address the concerns of some elements among the rural stakeholders who are being asked to share their landscapes with wolves for the first time in several generations. In these recovery landscapes, wolves are associated with a wide range of conflicts that include economic, psychological, perceptional, social, cultural and political dimensions. A recurring demand concerns the desire to introduce the use of carefully regulated lethal control of wolves, through either culling by state employees or hunting conducted by rural hunters. Introducing such measures can be very controversial, and many critics challenge their legality under the international wildlife conservation instruments that have nurtured wolf recovery. We evaluate this issue for the case of wolves in Norway, which are strictly protected under the Bern Convention. Drawing on the latest results of social science research, we present the multiple lines of argumentation that are often used to justify killing wolves and relate these to the criteria for exceptions that exist under the Bern Convention. We conclude that while the Convention provides apparent scope for allowing the killing of wolves as a means to address conflicts, this must be clearly justified and proportional to the conservation status of wolves so as to not endanger their recovery.

AB  - Sustainability, entrepreneurship and tourism, destination and hospitality research have attracted scholars' attention for their relevance in bringing to fruition a future that links economic well-being with the environmental, cultural, and social sustainability of human beings. This article provides a bibliometric overview of the academic research where these topics intersect. To accomplish this, various bibliometric methods are implemented, which include a performance analysis and graphic mapping of the academic production in this specific topic. This research uses the Web of Science database to identify and classify the most preponderant investigations in the field and considers articles, authors, institutions, countries, and journals. To complete the performance analysis, a series of indicators, such as number of papers and number of citations, are used. Graphic visualization maps are produced using the co-citation and co-occurrence of keywords under the Visualization of Similarities-VOSviewer-software. The results show a growing concern for entrepreneurship in sustainable tourism development research, which is evidenced in the increasing number of studies during the last decade. Some influential research institutions and authors from countries including the USA, New Zealand, and Norway are found to be influential leaders in this topic. Additionally, the results show that journals from the area of hospitality, leisure, sport, and tourism are frontrunners in this subject.

AB  - Sediment sequences spanning the last 800 years from two small lakes in the south Swedish uplands were explored for assessment of effects of changing human population, local land-use practices and airborne pollution on lake-ecosystem functioning and resilience. Variations in nutrient cycling and deposition of lithogenic elements were studied, using a multi-proxy stratigraphic approach. Carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic analyses were applied in combination with records of hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) to investigate the sources and depositional conditions of sediment organic matter. Changes in fluvial and airborne delivery of inorganic matter were based on X-ray fluorescence measurements. The results reveal that population growth and related increases in land-use pressure had a major impact on catchment erosion and input of terrestrial organic matter to the lakes from the 1500s to the end of the 1800s. Evidence also exists of a brief period of catchment disturbance at ca. 1200-1300, followed by recovery, likely connected to the Black Death pandemic. At ca. 1900 synchronous shifts in most of the proxy records suggest a marked change in external forcing common to the two lakes related to a major decrease in population density and the introduction of modern forestry following the industrial revolution. Interestingly, the two sediment records exhibit generally coherent trends in C/N ratio, organic C content and delta C-13, both before and after 1900, indicating broadly similar sensitivities of the lake ecosystems to human impact. In contrast, deviating trends in total N content, delta N-15 and lithogenic element concentrations (K, Ti, Rb and Zr) reflect site-specific responses to local disturbances during the last century due to different nutrient conditions and catchment properties. Our companion sediment records highlight the importance of understanding long-term human impact on watersheds and demonstrate how regional versus local forcing of lake ecosystems, as well as site-specific responses related to catchment characteristics can be reconstructed.

AB  - Ungulate grazing and trampling strongly affect pastures and ecosystems throughout the world. Ecological population models are used for studying these systems and determining the guidelines for sustainable and economically viable management. However, the effect of trampling and other resource wastage is either not taken into account or quantified with data in earlier models. Also, the ability of models to describe the herbivore impact on pastures is usually not validated. We used a detailed model and data to study the level of winter- and summertime lichen wastage by reindeer and the effects of wastage on population sizes and management. We also validated the model with respect to its ability of predicting changes in lichen biomass and compared the actual management in herding districts with model results. The modeling efficiency value (0.75) and visual comparison between the model predictions and data showed that the model was able to describe the changes in lichen pastures caused by reindeer grazing and trampling. At the current lichen biomass levels in the northernmost Finland, the lichen wastage varied from 0 to 1 times the lichen intake during winter and from 6 to 10 times the intake during summer. With a higher value for wastage, reindeer numbers and net revenues were lower in the economically optimal solutions. Higher wastage also favored the use of supplementary feeding in the optimal steady state. Actual reindeer numbers in the districts were higher than in the optimal steady-state solutions for the model in 18 herding districts out of 20. Synthesis and applications. We show that a complex model can be used for analyzing ungulate-pasture dynamics and sustainable management if the model is parameterized and validated for the system. Wastage levels caused by trampling and other causes should be quantified with data as they strongly affect the results and management recommendations. Summertime lichen wastage caused by reindeer is higher than expected, which suggests that seasonal pasture rotation should be used to prevent the heavy trampling of winter lichen pastures during summer. In the present situation, reindeer numbers in northernmost Finland are in most cases higher than in the management solutions given by the model.

AB  - This study investigates potential economic reasons why the production of trout is maintained in Norway by analyzing prices and production for Norwegian Atlantic salmon and trout. The species Atlantic salmon dominates the global salmon market, but its two largest producers, Norway and Chile also farm in sea pens significant quantities of large rainbow trout (as opposed to portion-sized Rainbow trout farmed in freshwaters in other parts of the World, e.g., Iran, Peru, Turkey, and others). Suggesting that these trout have some attributes that make it a useful complement to Atlantic salmon. We investigate development in supply volumes of these species and conduct a cointegration analysis using monthly prices from 2000 to 2018. The results show that the markets for fresh and frozen rainbow trout are tightly integrated with fresh Atlantic salmon, and, where the latter is a price leader. This means that many consumers consider the two products as substitutes, with no clear preferences. There is no apparent productivity argument for the continued production of rainbow trout vis-a-vis Atlantic salmon. However, there may exist a fringe of consumers that prefer its characteristics, motivating firms to maintain its production as a means of diversification.

AB  - Cities are growing rapidly, and the systems of production and consumption that support this growth are contributing to the depletion of natural resources and pollution of the environment. The circular economy model offers an alternative to the predominant take-make-dispose economic system. Local municipalities are seen to have the capacity to encourage sustainable development of the built environment. This paper aims to explore the role of strategic planning in facilitating a circular economy in urban settings. In particular, this research asks: How are local governments facilitating circular economy initiatives through strategic planning? What are the opportunities and barriers when applying circular economy principles through local strategic planning? The research approach used for this paper is a comparative case study of two international municipalities: the City of Melbourne, Australia and the City of Malmo, Sweden. Current strategic planning practice was examined with a focus on circular economy themes. The findings reveal that strategic urban planning can translate circular economy objectives into actions within specific urban areas, although barriers still exist to fully integrating the circular economy model.

AB  - The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction highlights the importance of all-hazard and multi-stakeholder approaches. This requires exchange and integration of risk information across sectorial and administrative borders. This paper focuses on challenges and prerequisites for aggregating risk information from multiple stakeholders in disaster risk management systems. Aggregation is here understood as comprising the sub processes of identifying one's information needs as well as retrieving the information and making sense of the assembled material. Using Sweden as a case, this study is based on participatory workshops with risk management officials at all 21 Swedish County Administrative Boards. Being positioned at the regional level, these officials are central to the quest of aggregation as they are tasked to relay risk management directives from national to local authorities, whilst conveying reports on societal risks to national authorities based on municipal risk and vulnerability assessments. Drawing on their collective experiences from aggregating risk information, the study reveals challenges in all sub processes involved where impediments relate to both structural and behavioral factors (e.g. lack of or conflicting regulations as well as motivation, trust, prestige, and accountability). Ideas on how to overcome some of these challenges are presented as well. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - SECURITY
AB  - Researchers have put forward agricultural biotechnology as one possible tool for increasing food production and making agriculture more sustainable. In this paper, it is investigated how key actors in the Swedish food supply chain perceive the concept of agricultural sustainability and the role of biotechnology in creating more sustainable agricultural production systems. Based on policy documents and semi-structured interviews with representatives of five organizations active in producing, processing and retailing food in Sweden, an attempt is made to answer the following three questions: How do key actors in the Swedish food supply chain define and operationalize the concept of agricultural sustainability? Who/what influences these organizations' sustainability policies and their respective positions on agricultural biotechnology? What are the organizations' views and perceptions of biotechnology and its possible role in creating agricultural sustainability? Based on collected data, it is concluded that, although there is a shared view of the core constituents of agricultural sustainability among the organizations, there is less explicit consensus on how the concept should be put into practice or what role biotechnology can play in furthering agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Treatment peatlands are water purification systems located on existing mires. They are commonly used to treat different types of waters, ranging from municipal wastewaters to mine effluent. This study evaluated the capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, color infrared imaging, and stable water isotopes as a combined method for monitoring the functioning of a treatment peatland purifying mine process effluent water under boreal conditions in northern Finland. The results showed that TIR was an efficient tool for pinpointing cold groundwater seepage points in the peatland area that were not otherwise visible. Color infrared imaging was used to define Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of plant health in the treatment area. A NDVI map of the area, measured on a day representing the main growing season (summer, +12 degrees C day temperature), revealed areas with stressed coniferous trees. This was probably due to excess water in these areas, resulting from successful spread of the process effluent water to the treatment peatland. Stable water isotopes were able to spatially differentiate the treated process effluent water, surface waters, and groundwater in different parts of the treatment peatland. This first attempt at combining these methods in monitoring of treatment peatlands was promising, as the results obtained with different methods complemented each other. While they produce only a snapshot of prevailing conditions, all three methods, singly and in combination, could be valuable tools in treatment peatland management.

AB  - High-capacity public transport services such as metro and commuter trains are efficient during normal operations but are vulnerable to disruptions. To manage disruptions, bridging buses are commonly called in to replace the rail-based service along the disrupted lines. These often take significant time to arrive and are costly to keep stand-by. Demand-responsive transport such as taxi can respond to demand almost immediately but is costly and must usually be arranged by the individual travelers. This study examines the integration and potential role of demand-responsive transport in disruption management. The analysis considers the impacts of limiting the serving area, varying the number of available vehicles, pursuing ride-sharing, as well as a system-of-systems approach with collaboration between taxis and bridging buses. Results of computational experiments on the case study of Stockholm, Sweden reveal that integration of demand-responsive transport in the disruption management can bring large positive benefits in terms of average and maximum waiting times for travelers. This is especially the case for strategies including ride-sharing. It is also shown that appropriate trade-offs between desired waiting times and costs can be achieved by collaboration of both bridging buses and demand-responsive transport. Additionally, more robust public transport with increased reliability during disruptions can increase sustainability as more people may choose public transport instead of private cars.

AB  - Agricultural production is already, and obviously, affected by climate change. Adapting to climate change includes reducing future risks to ensure yield quality and quantity and considers seizing any potential opportunities induced by climate change. In higher latitude areas, such as Norway, cold climate limits the cultivation of fruits. An increase in temperature offers more favorable conditions for fruit production. In this study, using available phenological observations (full blooming) and harvest dates, and meteorological data from the experimental orchard of NIBIO Ullensvang, the minimum heat requirements for growing different apple varieties are determined. Those criteria are used for zoning of the areas with heat favorable conditions for apple growing. Data on six varieties were used, with lower and higher requirements for heat for fruit development (Discovery, Gravenstein, Summerred, Aroma, Rubinstep, and Elstar). High resolution daily temperature data were generated and used for zoning of the areas with heat favorable conditions for apple growing within the selected domain, which includes Western Norway, Southern Norway, Eastern Norway, and the western part of Trondelag, Mid-Norway. Dynamics of the change in such surfaces was assessed for the period of 1961-2020. The total surface with favorable heat conditions for growing the varieties with lesser requirement for heat increased three times during this period. The growing of more heat-demanding varieties increased from near zero to about 2.5% of the studied land surface. In the period of 2011-2020, surface area with favorable heat conditions for apple growing was almost 27,000 km(2), and a surface area of about 4600 km(2) can sustain growing of more heat-demanding varieties. The presented results show the increasing potential of the climate of Norway for apple cultivation and highlight the importance of implementation of fruit production planned according to climate change trends, including the assessment of potential risks from climate hazards. However, the methodology for determining heat requirements can be improved by using phenological ripening dates if available, rather than harvest dates which are impacted by human decision. Zoning of areas with the potential of sustainable apple growing requires the use of future climate change assessments and information on land-related features.

AB  - Wind damage is known for causing threats to sustainable forest management and yield value in boreal forests. Information about wind damage risk can aid forest managers in understanding and possibly mitigating damage impacts. The objective of this research was to better understand and quantify drivers of wind damage, and to map the probability of wind damage. To accomplish this, we used open-access airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The probability of wind-induced forest damage (P-DAM) in southern Finland (61 degrees N, 23 degrees E) was modelled for a 173 km(2) study area of mainly managed boreal forests (dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine) and agricultural fields. Wind damage occurred in the study area in December 2011. LiDAR data were acquired prior to the damage in 2008. High spatial resolution aerial imagery, acquired after the damage event (January, 2012) provided a source of model calibration via expert interpretation. A systematic grid (16 m x 16 m) was established and 430 sample grid cells were identified systematically and classified as damaged or undamaged based on visual interpretation using the aerial images. Potential drivers associated with P-DAM were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model. Risk model predictors were extracted from the LiDAR-derived surface models. Geographic information systems (GIS) supported spatial mapping and identification of areas of high P-DAM across the study area. The risk model based on LiDAR data provided good agreement with detected risk areas (73 % with kappa-value 0,47). The strongest predictors in the risk model were mean canopy height and mean elevation. Our results indicate that open-access LiDAR data sets can be used to map the probability of wind damage risk without field data, providing valuable information for forest management planning.

CP  - International Symposium on Suspended Particulate Matter in Rivers and Estuaries
AB  - Samples of 1) suspended load and 2) overbank sediment were collected from three Norwegian rivers. Suspended sediment transport was calculated on the basis of 1-4 samples a day in the frost free periods of 1987-1993, while chemical composition of suspended sediment was determined on samples collected once a week. Samples of vertical sections of overbank sediment were collected once. The samples were analyzed for the acid soluble fraction of 29 elements of which 6 are treated here. The short-term variations of particulate element transport rates seem to be more dependent on sediment transport rates than on element concentration. Short-term variations of the chemical composition of suspended sediment were caused by variations in the chemical composition of the sediment sources, or by secondary effects such as variations in grain size. Based on sedimentological observations and radiogenic dating of the overbank sediment, it is suggested that major floods are key factors controlling long-term availability of sediment in Norwegian rivers. In the watershed of the Knabana-Kvina river, mining activities have increased sediment transport rates and caused up to 40 times increase of Mo-concentrations in overbank sediment. The chemical composition of the suspended load is still influenced by the mine waste 20 years after the mine has been closed.

AB  - Environmental change, including joint effects of increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) in boreal northern lakes may affect food web energy sources and the biochemical composition of organisms. These environmental stressors are enhanced by anthropogenic land-use and can decrease the quality of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in seston and zooplankton, and therefore, possibly cascading up to fish. In contrast, the content of mercury in fish increases with lake browning potentially amplified by intensive forestry practises. However, there is little evidence on how these environmental stressors simultaneously impact beneficial omega-3 fatty acid (n3-FA) and total mercury (THg) content of fish muscle for human consumption. A space-for-time substitution study was conducted to assess whether environmental stressors affect Eurasian perch (Perea fluviatilis) allochthony and muscle nutritional quality [PUPA, THg, and their derivative, the hazard quotient (HQ)]. Perch samples were collected from 31 Finnish lakes along pronounced lake size (0.03-107.5 km(2)), DOC (5.0-24.3 mg L-1), TP (5-118 mu g L-1) and land-use gradients (forest: 50.7-96.4%, agriculture: 0-32A%). These environmental gradients were combined using principal component analysis (PCA). Allochthony for individual perch was modelled using source and consumer delta H-2 values. Perch allochthony increased with decreasing lake pH and increasing forest coverage (PC1), but no correlation between lake DOC and perch allochthony was found. Perch muscle THg and omega-6 fatty acid (n6-FA) content increased with PC1 parallel with allochthony. Perch muscle DHA (22:6n3) content decreased, and ALA (18:3n3) increased towards shallower murkier lakes (PC2). Perch allochthony was positively correlated with muscle THg and n6-FA content, but did not correlate with n3-FA content. Hence, the quality of perch muscle for human consumption decreases (increase in HQ) with increasing forest coverage and decreasing pH, potentially mediated by increasing fish allochthony.

AB  - Invasive alien species are recognized as a significant anthropogenic threat to freshwater ecosystems, because they may bring about the local extinction of native species and the collapse of habitat types of special conservation concern. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is an important legislative tool for the protection of water bodies in the European Union. It requires the assessment of the ecological status of water bodies and the enforcement of measures for water bodies that fail to achieve at least 'good' ecological status. However, the WFD does not explicitly mention alien species. This article presents a three-tiered approach for the incorporation of data on alien species into WFD assessments of freshwater bodies in Norway. If relevant data on WFD parameters are available for the water body under consideration, its ecological status should be inferred from those data. Otherwise, ecological status should be assessed using evidence of the effects that the alien species have on biological quality elements in comparable water bodies. If neither of these options is feasible, the ecological status should be classified according to the ecological effect score of the alien species present, as obtained from the Generic Ecological Impact Assessment of Alien Species (GEIAA). It is further recommended that a water body cannot be assigned 'high ecological status' if at least one alien species is present. If more than one alien species is present, the status is determined by the species with the highest impact. Ecological, geographical, historical, and taxonomic delimitation criteria for this assessment method are presented, together with a list of the alien species that at present fulfil these delimitations in Norway. The management implications of the recommendations are that more Norwegian freshwater bodies are likely to require measures, and that further data must be collected. Most of the recommendations are transferable to other countries, although they may require adjustment.

AB  - Riverscapes are under pressure from anthropogenic development, and this challenges the conservation of biodiversity, hydromorphology and land types. To assess changes and restoration potential, an understanding of alteration to rivers overtime is necessary. This can be challenging due to lack of data, shortcomings in methods and data formats that are not easily incorporated into the assessment process. Historical aerial imagery exists for rivers prior to modification, but the manual classification is time-consuming. Deep learning is increasingly used in image processing, and here we outline how a convolutional neural network can be used to automatically classify black and white aerial imagery from the database of the Norwegian mapping authority into habitat types. It is demonstrated how historical imagery can be used to develop maps that can be processed further in a GIS to evaluate natural versus anthropogenic changes over time.

AB  - There is a growing societal demand to increase the use of forest biomass for substitution of fossil fuels. The production of this biomass must be sustainable and an indicator for critical biomass harvesting (CBH) has been suggested in order to sustain forest soil fertility and mitigate soil acidification at whole-tree harvesting. The CBH indicator is based on an acidity mass balance approach in line with the critical load of acid deposition (CL) concept. Countries like Sweden, the Netherlands and the state of Quebec, Canada apply such mass balance approaches for developing forest biomass harvesting guidelines. The implementation of this type of policy instrument may restrict the use of harvest residues for bioenergy and thereby the substitution of fossil fuels. It may as well affect the forestry sector revenue negatively. To maintain credibility for enforced limitations, it is important that the risk assessment and suggested policy implications are based on solid scientific methods and assumptions. The mass balance approach have been criticized for being too uncertain and not sufficiently validated for being used to guide ecosystem management. In this paper we use published Swedish data on soils, acid deposition, forest production and information from international scientific literature to critically examine the CBH indicator. We conclude that the CBH indicator 1) does not account for all relevant processes 2) it exaggerates the sensitivity and correlates poorly to actual forest soil acid-base status and edaphic conditions and 3) data availability does not allow the indicator to be calculated at a high enough spatial resolution for advice on management for forest owners. The concerns for the mass-balance approach and CBH indicator are discussed in an international perspective.

AB  - E-grocery is developing into a frequent and prominent form of online shopping. While some empirical studies suggest that online shopping substitutes personal shopping travel, others indicate a limited or no impact on number of trips and travel distance. Mobility for passengers and freight is one of the key issues in integrated planning in urban areas, and the growth of e-commerce and home deliveries is likely to affect the structure and performance of the urban freight chain. This study explores the use of home delivery services through a survey among Norwegian users of services connected to food and groceries. The study draws on insight from the survey to discuss how city municipalities can integrate trends of urbanisation and digitalisation into planning for sustainable mobility and efficient urban freight transport. A prominent finding is that home delivery of food and groceries is associated with fewer trips to physical grocery stores and reduced car use on these trips. In considering implications for city planning, several strategies and potential instruments are presented and discussed.

AB  - Environmental constraints in hydropower systems serve to ensure sustainable use of water resources. Through accurate treatment in hydropower scheduling, one seeks to respect such constraints in the planning phase while optimizing the utilization of hydropower. However, many environmental constraints introduce state-dependencies and even nonconvexities to the scheduling problem, making them challenging to represent in stochastic hydropower scheduling models. This paper describes how the state-dependent maximum discharge constraint, which is widely enforced in the Norwegian hydropower system, can be embedded within the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm for hydropower scheduling without compromising computational time. In this work, a combination of constraint relaxation and time-dependent auxiliary lower reservoir volume bounds is applied, and the modeling is verified through computational experiments on two different systems. The results demonstrate that the addition of an auxiliary lower bound on reservoir volume has significant potential for improved system operation, and that a bound based on the minimum accumulated inflow in the constraint period is the most efficient.

AB  - Population growth and urbanization have led to increases in energy demand and consequently, greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the availability of the fossil fuel as the main source of energy supply has been changed. Utilization of renewable resources including solar, wind, and hydropower together with distributed energy systems could eliminate the dependency on fossil fuel energy sources. In this paper, energy use and supply trends have been studied for the Counties of Vastmanland and Sodermanland in Sweden in order to develop a scenario for the regional energy system in 2030. The aim is to use the scenario for evaluation of the impacts of regional renewable energy resources on the production planning of CHP plants. The scenario shows that there is not enough potential for electricity production from renewable resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower to fulfill the estimated demand in 2030. Around 75% of electricity needs in Vastmanland and 89% of power demands in Sodermanland need to be met by imported electricity to these regions. Efficiency improvements and a more complex energy system integrating also with other energy resources like biomass, waste and industrial waste heat are necessary to develop a sustainable energy system.

AB  - Farmland birds in Europe have declined in numbers from the last decades, as reflected in the Farmland Bird Index (FBI), a multi-species indicator of population trends adopted by the European Union. Some of these farmland bird species breed to a varying degree also in non-farmland habitats: however, the indicator is calculated using trends estimated from all birds counted of each species, irrespective of habitat. Consequently, when interpreting indicators of farmland birds, it is important to know the influence of including the trends of the populations in non-farmland habitats. We estimated national and regional bird-habitat relationships and population trends of 14 of the species included in the Swedish version of FBI. Bird data came from the Swedish Bird Survey (1996-2008) including 716 separate routes, and detailed habitat data came from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (1999-2008).
   The proportion of individuals that occurred in non-farmland habitats ranged from 2% to 96%. Local densities were generally highest in farmland habitats, but because only 7-8% of the surface of Sweden is farmland, even low local densities in non-farmland sum up to high national totals. With few exceptions, the temporal trends of species were independent of the amount of farmland on routes, suggesting similar trends within and outside farmland. Accordingly, incorporating data on farmland birds from non-farmland habitats had only a limited effect on the FBI. But given that habitat-specific trends may well occur, it is important that multi-species indices are checked for potential habitat-specific differences among the included species.

AB  - Multi-proxy studies are becoming increasingly common in palaeolimnology. Eight basic requirements and challenges for a multi-proxy study are outlined in this essay - definition of research questions, leadership, site selection and coring, data storage, chronology, presentation of results, numerical tools and data interpretation. The nature of proxy data is discussed in terms of physical proxies and biotic proxies. Loss-on-ignition changes and the use of transfer functions are reviewed as examples of problems in the interpretation of data from multi-proxy studies. The importance of pollen analysis and plant macrofossil analysis in multi-proxy studies is emphasised as lake history cannot be interpreted without knowledge of catchment history. Future directions are outlined about how multi-proxy studies can contribute to understanding biotic responses to environmental change.

AB  - This article examines how safety is understood and practised by wilderness guides leading nature excursions with international customers in Finnish Lapland. Commercial nature tourism services in Lapland are not considered adventure-oriented since risk-taking is not an integral part of the guided services. The study shows that even though perceived as low-risk activities, risks are present in a significant part of the everyday actions in commercial nature tourism services. Thus, commercial nature tourism forms a rich context to study the sustainability of contemporary safety practices since it forms a specific, guide-dependent sector of the tourism industry. The discussion further underlines the complexity of safety issues within the industry and the importance of holistic approaches.

AB  - Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L) populations in Finland have decreased markedly during past decades. one of the assumed reasons is the decreased quality of brood feeding grounds since current forest management transfers mature forests to younger successional stages. We studied how different types of managed Finnish forests offer resources for capercaillie broods by comparing the vegetation and invertebrate fauna of four successional stages in the two most common forest types in Finland, spruce dominated Vaccinium myrtillus (MT) and pine dominated Vaccinium vitis-idaea (VT) type. Forest age class had a significant effect on the cover of bilberry. There was a positive correlation between bilberry cover and the biomass of larvae and of all invertebrates (including all developmental stages) both at the stand and the sample level. Both forest type and age class significantly affected the biomass of larvae. Mature stands and young stands had the highest biomass of larvae in both MIT and VT. In both forest site types the sapling stands hosted the smallest biomass of larvae. The results suggest that successional stages that follow clear cutting seriously lowers the food availability for capercaillie chicks and also reduces the shelter that field layer might provide. However, already the young stages that follow sapling phases seem to provide both bilberries and invertebrates so it is quite unlikely that the bilberry abundance alone could explain the dramatic decline of the capercaillie.

AB  - There is a genuine will to protect Nordic wooden towns in Norway, as they are considered national heritage and an important part of the urban identity. The fire protection of wooden heritage towns is an ongoing cooperation between private owners, who are required to keep their property up to codes, and the authorities who works to limit the residual conflagration risk. The present study systemizes national fire protection initiatives and present successes and challenges. Research literature, legal framework, and municipality fire safety site plans were analyzed. Personnel from involved municipalities, fire services and national directorates were interviewed. Compared to other countries, Norway has indeed come a long way regarding practical fire mitigating measures. In year 2000, the first fire safety plans dedicated to protecting wooden towns were developed. In 2014, 25% of the wooden towns had fire safety plans, and in 2020, 60%. Status as national heritage and thus, financial support from the Directorate of Cultural Heritage, was the most important success factor. Measures were often not evaluated prior to implementation, partly due to lack of horizontal knowledge sharing between the municipalities involved. Important lessons have thus been gained separately, and not shared. Smoke detection alarming the fire brigades directly is documented to have prevented major heritage losses. The most common firefighting challenges were related to locating and accessing fires in cavities. Through clearer wording in regulations, and better knowledge sharing, fire protection could be improved with limited additional costs.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to contribute towards a better understanding of knowledge in food tourism in agricultural and/or fishery areas. The presence and role of different types of knowledge are investigated adopting a multiple case study strategy in the regions of Lofoten (Norway) and Maremma Toscana (Italy). The following types of knowledge are investigated: local and scientific food knowledge, tourism knowledge, local and global managerial and political knowledge. The results from the case study indicate that scientific food knowledge and global managerial and political knowledge are particularly important in Lofoten. These types of knowledge are identified as the strengths on which a form of gourmet food tourism could develop. In Maremma Toscana, local food knowledge and local managerial and political knowledge are identified as the basis of the development of a generic form of food tourism. It is concluded that food tourism development requires different types of knowledge and their role is strictly dependent on the specific context. Any policy regarding food tourism should be based on the peculiarities of the specific terroir. Further research is required to investigate the tacit dimension of knowledge and those factors that can favour the establishment of global knowledge-based networks.

This case study presents the nanosize off-grid energy system at the Meteoria visitor center in Ostrobothnia, Finland, and the realtime measuring techniques that have been installed to follow up the energy production and consumption. The Meteoria consists of several buildings, which are open to the public from April to October. The case site is operated by energy derived from wind power, solar power, and a diesel generator (as a backup), with batteries for energy storage. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been retrofitted to the existing energy system to enable energy measurements and follow various electrical parameters in real-time. In addition, a graphical visualization platform open to the public has been developed. In this study, the completeness of data sampling and the IoT system was checked, and the results show high availability of data. Furthermore, various errors/limitations regarding the IoT system were identified. The energy supply/demand at the Meteoria in 2021 was monitored and the challenges regarding the existing energy system in a cold climate zone are discussed as well as the potential role of the Meteoria to function as a living lab.

AB  - Knowledge of future developments in agriculture and how these will affect nutrient leakage from arable land is important in efforts to achieve good ecological status of surface waters. This study assessed the impact of five scenarios for a bioresource-based economy, involving use of renewable biological resources from land and sea, on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leakage from arable land to surface-waters and groundwater. The scenarios (developed in an earlier study) were applied to two areas in central Sweden, leaching region LR-6 (5350 km2) and catchment C6 (19 km2). Using the NLeCCS calculation system to produce leakage coefficients, we evaluated the changes in total N and total P leakage from arable soil. The leakage coefficients described agricultural management practices and climate conditions representing the leaching region LR-6 in Sweden and the baseline year was 2016. The scenarios varied from a baseline in terms of crop combination (relative area of different crops) and extent of mitigation measures (e.g. delayed tillage date, buffer zone width and relative area, and catch crop). Expected consumption of meat varied in the scenarios, with lower consumption meaning fewer cattle and consequently less grass ley. The scenarios was supplemented with calculations of introducing mitigation mea-sures up to their maximum potential. In leaching region LR-6, calculated baseline leakages was 10.5 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 0.87 kg P ha-1 year-1, values that varied in the scenarios by-4% to 5% (N) and-6% to 19% (P). In catchment C6 calculated baseline leakages was 7.1 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 1.11 kg P ha-1 year-1, and the values in the scenarios varied by-15% to 2% (N) and-5% to 5% (P). Assuming maximum potential of the mitigation measures decreased leakage further, by up to-19%. Crop combination had a major impact on total N and P leakage in the scenarios. Leakage increased when the amount of grass ley in the rotation decreased, but remained relatively unchanged when the crop combination change only involved annual crops. Frequency of the mitigation measures increased in all scenarios, with associated decreases in N and P leakage that counteracted the increased leakage caused by changes in crop combination. The most effective mitigation measure was catch crop for N leakage and delayed soil tillage for P leakage.

AB  - Fisheries discards are often seen as a waste of resources and an impediment to the management of fish stocks. However, many traditional fisheries management measures have effectively encouraged discarding. This controversial dichotomy has recently prompted the European Commission to review its approach to managing discards, particularly in the North Sea, where discard rates are among the highest in the world. The European Commission jointly manages North Sea fisheries with Norway; however, in Norwegian waters, discarding is banned. To assess the effectiveness of this Norwegian policy, this study examined its effect on biologically isolated stocks of cod, haddock, saithe, and herring in the Northeast Arctic. Trends in stock status and economic performance showed that the Norwegian approach in the Northeast Arctic has been more successful than the joint approach in the North Sea. After considering the economics and current status of stocks, it is concluded that a discard ban throughout the North Sea for the above species could also offer substantial benefits. Implementation of this policy would be complicated by the more mixed nature (both politically and biologically) of North Sea fisheries, but the use of real-time area closures, gear modifications, and electronic monitoring systems could help ensure compliance and effectiveness.

AB  - Compared to the other northern large carnivores, wolverines Gulo gulo are thought to be the most sensitive species with regard to habitat changes and human disturbance. Nowadays wolverines in Scandinavia are found in remote high alpine areas, and we investigated whether human development through presence of infrastructure has relegated them to these areas. We analysed wolverine habitat selection and the impact of infrastructure in two study areas in Norway using compositional analysis. We found that alpine tundra with low human development was important for wolverines to locate their home ranges. Human development formed a more important factor for home range location than did habitat, because habitat selectivity was much higher in undeveloped habitats than in developed habitats. Within their home ranges, wolverines used alpine shrubland and forest, irrespective of human development. The sympatric distribution of wolverines with wild and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus indicates that wolverines are vulnerable to indirect loss of habitat. However, we hypothesise that wolverine distribution may be partly influenced by direct disturbance or higher risk of human-caused mortality associated with infrastructure. Increased human development and activity in once remote areas may thus cause reduced ability of wolverines to perform their daily activities unimpeded, making the habitat less optimal or causing wolverines to avoid the disturbed area. Our results suggest that the potential exists for further wolverine recovery in forest ecosystems with low levels of infrastructural development.

AB  - Soil geochemical baselines of potentially toxic elements were studied in two cities: Tampere in Finland and Taltal in Chile. Soil samples were sieved to the <2 mm grain-size fraction and the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn were measured after aqua regia extraction. The upper limit of baseline variation was defined for the topsoils of Tampere and for soil samples from various lithological units in Taltal. Arsenic was the potentially toxic element of most concern in both towns. In both cases, arsenic concentrations were mostly geogenic. Anthropogenic activities related to the long mining history had caused elevated As concentrations in the topsoil samples in parts of Taltal city and soils surrounding abandoned mining wastes. In the case of this study, the geochemical baseline was useful to show the pollution level of As. Vanadium concentrations were also higher than the global average values in soils of Taltal commune. Heatmap plots based on compositional data analysis revealed that the abundance of mica minerals and soil organic matter controlled the distribution of most of the studied elements in Tampere, while the clustering of metals in Taltal was probably related to either abandoned mining sites or active mining operations. Regional baseline values should be used for the assessment of soil contamination with these elements in both cities.

AB  - Background: In recent decades the frequency and severity of natural disturbances by e. g., strong winds and insect outbreaks has increased considerably in many forest ecosystems around the world. Future climate change is expected to further intensify disturbance regimes, which makes addressing disturbances in ecosystem management a top priority. As a prerequisite a broader understanding of disturbance impacts and ecosystem responses is needed. With regard to the effects of strong winds - the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe - monitoring and management has focused on structural damage, i.e., tree mortality from uprooting and stem breakage. Effects on the functioning of trees surviving the storm (e.g., their productivity and allocation) have been rarely accounted for to date.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that growth reduction was significant and pervasive in a 6.79.million hectare forest landscape in southern Sweden following the storm Gudrun (January 2005). Wind-related growth reduction in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests surviving the storm exceeded 10% in the worst hit regions, and was closely related to maximum gust wind speed (R-2 = 0.849) and structural wind damage (R-2 = 0.782). At the landscape scale, wind-related growth reduction amounted to 3.0 million m(3) in the three years following Gudrun. It thus exceeds secondary damage from bark beetles after Gudrun as well as the long-term average storm damage from uprooting and stem breakage in Sweden.
   Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that the impact of strong winds on forest ecosystems is not limited to the immediately visible area of structural damage, and call for a broader consideration of disturbance effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in the context of forest management and climate change mitigation.

AB  - The open landscapes produced over centuries by small-scale farming in Norwegian coastal and fjord areas are threatened by agricultural abandonment, raising public concern for maintenance of the species-rich and valuable coastal grasslands. Semi-natural grasslands, traditionally grazed in the spring and fall and mown in summer, are most affected. Two linear programming models, one for small-scale sheep and one for small-scale mixed dairy and meat farms, both described in a separate method article, were developed. In the models is studied effects on production, grazing and land utilization, of altering government financial support among leys on arable land, enclosed farm pasture, grazing animals, and altering the (regulated) prices farmers pay for concentrate feed at the farm level. Sheep grazing can be expanded by intensification through increased fertilization and purchase of concentrate feed. Raising steers instead of bulls on dairy and beef farms with a milk quota would result in more mixed grazing by both sheep and steers, which is advantageous for the landscape. Steers are currently quite rare in Norway and their numbers can be increased with more subsidies for grazing, (Grazing Support (GS)) or by increasing the Regional Environmental Support (RES), a policy instrument targeting local projects for more grazing in specific areas. The current Agriculture and Cultural Landscape (ACL) subsidy payment places a higher value on arable land compared to the more biodiverse farm pastures, resulting in weaker incentives for keeping farm pasture in production. Raising the rate for farm pasture relative to that of arable land in the ACL scheme would result in stronger incentives for keeping such farm pasture in production, and likely increase biodiversity and landscape values. Increased GS for sheep might lead to more purchase of concentrate to keep more animals through the winter and eventually needs to be counteracted with higher prices for concentrated feedstuffs.

AB  - Parasite communities in four study lakes in 1986 reflected the influences of eutrophication, pollution, and habitat fragmentation. Discriminant analyses of communities at the individual host level revealed two major axes. One contrasted communities in a lake affected by chemical pollution from a pulp mill with those from two eutrophic, less polluted lakes. Changes in the density of intermediate hosts, direct effects on ectoparasites, and impaired immune systems were regarded as important mechanisms. The second contrasted communities in an oligotrophic, unpolluted lake with those from the two eutrophic lakes and was more complex, reflecting habitat fragmentation (the absence of glochidia and some digeneans) and pollution or eutrophication, probably mediated by the same mechanisms as above. Changes in some index parasites in Lake Vatia monitored in 1994, following 8 years of reduced pollutant loading, supported our conclusion that parasite faunas in Lake Vatia in 1986 involved the effects of pollution.

AB  - Smart Cities are emerging as a strategy to manage the problems generated by urban population growth and rapid urbanization. The push for sustainable growth via the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as the motivation of companies to adopt the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework (which also echoes sustainable value creation) interlinks the collaborative governance relationship between global institutions, countries, government, businesses and the public. The comparison of smart governance or e-governance, to the traditional concept of good governance is relevant to ensure consistency of goals and motivations, across all levels of stakeholders. This study initially identified firms recognized for their financial reporting, as a proxy for firm level good governance, which were then grouped into the top five countries based on frequency. The countries identified were UK (17%), Sweden (12%), Germany (11%), Japan (11%) and France (8%). All five countries are developed nations and are members of the OECD and UN. The results suggest an interesting "East meets West" perspective, with each of the countries reflecting different cultural values that motivate the route to good governance. The five countries were initially measured using the traditional measures of good governance and culture, and subsequently compared to e-governance and e-participation indexes. Data for this research have been extracted from reliable sources such as the World Bank, United Nations, Transparency International, World Justice Project and OECD. The research reports inconsistent results when using different basis of assessments, which indicates the lack of integration across goals and methods, differing between platform and the genuine intent to participate or to allow participation.

AB  - Most of Norway's oceans are situated to the north of the Arctic Circle and some of the world's richest fishing grounds are there. The largest fish stocks are shared with other countries, and international cooperation on the management of the resources is therefore an important aspect of Norway's northern policy. Such cooperation is based on the international norms for how living marine resources are to be managed and shared, and it takes place in a number of bilateral and regional fora. There are challenges related to the allocation of pelagic resources in the Norwegian Sea and climate change driving change in the geographical distribution of fish stocks in the ocean. A recent precautionary measure in relation to climate change and its effects on marine ecosystems is the establishment of an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in international waters in the central Arctic Ocean.

AB  - Supranational policies move from their places of spatial design towards domestic and local materialization, a journey on which policy programs are subject to multiple loops of translation in various spatial contexts. These loops involve shifting rationalities, historically formed path dependencies and distinct constellations of stakeholders, all of which affect the means of their implementation within national and regional socio-spatial environments. This article evaluates the complexity of governance assemblages based on the translation and mutation of European Union bioenergy policies. As part of the transition towards a low carbon economy, EU member states have been given the responsibility to choose their own approaches within the common EU 2020 renewable energy framework. While EU documents highlight energy security, energy union and sustainability, a contested policy translation process reformulates governance means and aims along the way and sometimes causes the generic targets to vanish. Thus, context dependent decision making assemblages are portrayed as shaping the policy process and the advancement of renewable energy in various directions. The article bundles the empirical results of case studies in Finland, Germany, Estonia, France, and Norway, as well as EU institutions in Brussels to conceptualize peculiarities that guide policy design, translation and boosterist processes in transnational governance.

AB  - Farmers' relationship with nature is determined by the significance of agriculture for human beings. When agriculture is defined as human activity that uses renewable natural resources and aims to produce usable food and fiber products, agriculture is explicitly defined as production. Farmers' relationship with nature is based on the principle of production. This article discusses the contradiction between the peasant values of protection of nature that many farmers in Finland still have and the environmental harm their production-oriented farming style causes. When farmers interpret their farming practices as harmonious co-operation with nature, it is difficult for them to see the polluting effects of their work. Paul B. Thompson's suggestion that three religious-philosophical doctrines (hard work, the doctrine of grace, and the myth of garden) have made it easy for farmers to adopt productionist farming strategy is used as a framework to interpret farmers' narrative; concerning their relationship with nature. The research is qualitative and biographical. The data include life stories and biographical texts farmers wrote for a competition in 1997.

AB  - Surface water browning affects boreal lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. This process is expected to increase with global warming. Boreal lakes are the most numerous lakes on Earth. These ecosystems are particularly sensitive to disturbances due to their low biodiversity compared to other aquatic environments. The recent darkening of surface water is expected to hinder key ecosystem processes, particularly through lower primary productivity and loss of biodiversity. However, studies based on long-term data collections have rarely been conducted on the ecological consequences of water browning on aquatic food webs, especially concerning its impacts on invertebrate communities.
   For the first time, our analysis based on two decades of data collection in Finnish lakes highlighted a relation between water browning and a decline in aquatic macroinvertebrate abundances. Aquatic invertebrates are the main food resource for many secondary predators such as fish and waterbirds, hence such effect on their populations may have major consequences for boreal ecosystem functioning.<bold> </bold>

AB  - Expanding urbanization is a major factor behind rapidly declining biodiversity. It has been proposed that in urbanized societies, the rarity of contact with diverse environmental microbiota negatively impacts immune function and ultimately increases the risk for allergies and other immune-mediated disorders. Surprisingly, the basic assumption that urbanization reduces exposure to environmental microbiota and its transfer indoors has rarely been examined. We investigated if the land use type around Finnish homes affects the diversity, richness, and abundance of bacterial communities indoors. Debris deposited on standardized doormats was collected in 30 rural and 26 urban households in and near the city of Lahti, Finland, in August 2015. Debris was weighed, bacterial community composition determined by high throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the percentage of four different land use types (i.e., built area, forest, transitional, and open area) within 200 m and 2000 m radiuses from each household was characterized. The quantity of doormat debris was inversely correlated with coverage of built area. The diversity of total bacterial, Proteobacterial, Actinobacterial, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes communities decreased as the percentage of built area increased. Their richness followed the same pattern except for Firmicutes for which no association was observed. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria and particularly Gammaproteobacteria increased, whereas that of Actinobacteria decreased with increasing built area. Neither Phylum Firmicutes nor Bacteroidetes varied with coverage of built area. Additionally, the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacterial families and genera increased as the percentage of built area increased. Interestingly, having domestic animals (including pets) only altered the association between the richness of Gammaproteobacteria and diversity of Firmicutes with the built area coverage suggesting that animal ownership minimally affects transfer of environmental microbiota indoors from the living environment. These results support the hypothesis that people living in densely built areas are less exposed to diverse environmental microbiota than people living in more sparsely built areas.

AB  - Field-scale modelling is widely used as a means to look into interdependencies of processes and to assess potential effects of agricultural management practices as well as of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Generalisation from field-scale results to cover all agricultural land in a catchment by using typical soil-crop-slope combinations has been restricted by a lack of information for the systematic parameterisation of soils. Data from single experimental fields are seldom representative for the whole respective catchment. In this study typical soil profiles for mineral agricultural soils in Finland are defined. Key parameters describing e.g. the texture and water holding capacity of soils, were generated from existing soil data using expert knowledge and are aimed to be used for field-scale modelling when the target is not to model a particular field but soils of certain type in general. Estimates for water balance and phosphorus losses, obtained with the ICECREAM model by applying these data sets, were realistic and compatible with experimental results measured in Finland.

AB  - Along the succession gradient of the boreal forest ecosystem, black grouse Tetrao tetrix inhabits the early and capercaillie Tetrao urogallus the latest stages. When converting old forest to clearcuts and plantations, commercial forestry has therefore been assumed to affect capercaillie negatively and to be favourable to black grouse. During a 30-year period (1979-2008) we monitored sympatric populations of the two species in a forest in southeast Norway based on annual spring and autumn censuses and radio-marked birds. During this period, the proportion of old, semi-natural forest was halved and clearcuts and young plantations increased accordingly. The grouse populations did not change as predicted. While the trend in August numbers of adult black grouse declined, males more than females, abundance of adult capercaillie remained unchanged. Number of males at leks showed similar patterns. Equally surprising, breeding success (number of chicks per female in August) of both species increased, thus indicating that the populations were regulated more by variation in adult survivorship than by recruitment of young birds. No correlations were found with changing climatic factors (precipitation and temperatures in winter and spring, snow depth and time of snow melt), except that year-to-year breeding success was positively correlated with minimum temperatures during 2 weeks posthatch. The results are explained by a combination of more flexible habitat selection than previously assumed and a changing predator regime: In the early period, nearly all capercaillie leks were located in old, semi-natural forest, but as plantations grew older (> 30 years), new leks were established there. Similarly, while young capercaillie broods used old semi-natural forest almost exclusively when the study started, they frequently used middle-aged plantations, especially those with a ground cover of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, when these became common in later years. The increasing breeding success could largely be explained by more females rearing chicks successfully, presumably due to a marked decline in the main nest predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. A practice of thinning of the old, semi-natural forest some years prior to final harvesting probably facilitated predation of black grouse by goshawks Accipitergentilis. Contrary to many beliefs, our results indicate that both capercaillie and black grouse are quite tolerant to changes in forest management regimes. In our study, numerical and functional responses of predators (mainly red fox and goshawk) apparently played a more important role in regulating grouse numbers than habitat factors per se.

AB  - Urban areas have been considered "safe zones" for nesting birds because of low abundance of predators, and consequently low predation pressure. We studied risk of artificial ground nest predation across an urban gradient at regional (100 x 100 km) and local scales (5 x 5 km, within town) in Finland, Italy, and Spain. Risk of nest predation differed between countries, being greatest in Spain (66%), intermediate in Finland (51%), and lowest in Italy (29%). At the regional scale, risk of nest predation in Finland was lower in small villages and in forest area than in more urbanized sites. In Spain, the risk of nest predation was lower in villages than in the other habitat types. No differences in nest predation risk among habitat types were observed in Italy. At the local level, the risk of nest predation in Finland was higher within the town than in the surrounding forest. In Spain, the risk of nest predation in the surrounding forest area was as high as in the most urbanized areas. No difference in nest predation risk was observed between study plots in Italy at the local level analysis. Our results indicate that nest predation in town centers and their residential areas is similar to or higher than in villages and forest areas refuting the safe nesting zone hypothesis. Risk of nest predation also differed between residential area types within towns. Moreover, the abundance of potential nest predators differed between countries. Magpies and crows were more abundant in Finland than in Italy and Spain, whereas cats, dogs and pedestrians were less abundant in Finland than in the other countries. In Finland, risk of nest predation increased with the abundance of magpies. In Italy and Spain, risk of nest predation increased with the number of pedestrians and in Italy also with the number of cats. In all countries, the risk of nest predation increased with the visibility of the nest. According to our results, urban areas cannot be seen as "safe nesting zones". Actually, changes in nest predation pressure may cause changes in habitat selection patterns and affect bird community structure in urban environments.

AB  - This work examines and compares the performance of two oil-rich countries (Norway and Algeria) towards sustainable development amidst dutch disease. Norway and Algeria are both among the top oil exporting countries with same characteristics in terms of oil richness but differs in historical economic operations and development. Norway is among the best performing economies in the world while Algeria is still behind in economic operations and development. Comparing the two economies will form a basis for policy recommen-dation for the less performing oil exporting economies especially the ones in the category of Algeria. Two times series models were adopted for the two countries in separate form for effective comparison of the economies with the findings of the individual analysis. Quarterly data of 1999Q1-2018Q4 and 1999Q1-2019Q4 were applied for Algeria and Norway analysis respectively. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) dynamics and bound with granger causlity approaches were applied for the in-depth analysis of this study. Findings from the ARDL dy-namic and long run cointegration established symptoms of Dutch diseases for both countries with economic growth (GDP), government spending (GGFCE), crude oil price and real exchange rate having negative rela-tionship with agriculture (for Algerian model) and manufacturing sector (for Norwegian model) respectively. Again, FDI is confirmed having significantly positive relationship with agriculture and manufacturing sector for Algeria and Norway respectively. Also, findings from granger causality established nexus among the Dutch disease variables especially from the bi-directional interactions between the variables, and hence, attests to the findings of Dutch disease symptoms from the long run cointegration for both economies.

AB  - Pollen records contain a wide range of information about past land cover, but translation from the pollen diagram to other formats remains a challenge. In this paper, we present LandPolFlow, a software package enabling Multiple Scenario Approach (MSA) based land cover reconstruction from pollen records for specific landscapes. It has two components: a basic Geographic Information System which takes grids of landscape constraints (e.g., topography, geology) and generates possible "scenarios" of past land cover using a combination of probabilistic and deterministic placement rules to distribute defined plant communities within the landscape, and a pollen dispersal and deposition model which simulates pollen loading at specified points within each scenario and compares that statistically with actual pollen assemblages from the same location. Goodness of fit statistics from multiple pollen site locations are used to identify which scenarios are likely reconstructions of past land cover. We apply this approach to two case studies of Neolithisation in Britain, the first from the Somerset Levels and Moors and the second from Mainland, Orkney. Both landscapes contain significant evidence of Neolithic activity, but present contrasting contexts. In Somerset, wet-preserved Neolithic remains such as trackways are abundant, but little dry land settlement archaeology is known, and the pre-Neolithic landscape was extensively wooded. In Orkney, the Neolithic archaeology includes domestic and monumental stone-built structures forming a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the pre-Neolithic landscape was largely treeless. Existing pollen records were collated from both landscapes and correlated within new chronological frameworks (presented elsewhere). This allowed pollen data to be grouped into 200 year periods, or "timeslices," for reconstruction of land cover through time using the MSA. Reconstruction suggests that subtle but clear and persistent impacts of Neolithisation on land cover occurred in both landscapes, with no reduction in impact during periods when archaeological records suggest lower activity levels. By applying the methodology to specific landscapes, we critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses and identify potential remedies, which we then expand into consideration of how simulation can be incorporated into palynological research practice. We argue that the MSA deserves a place within the palynologist's standard tool kit.

AB  - As urban centres of agglomeration expand and compete for investment, new demands may arise for additional housing, infrastructure, and services. Failure to meet these demands imposes costs on firms and workers, stifles expansion, and potentially compromises the long-run economic competitiveness of the growth area. Drawing on evidence from Germany (Munich), Sweden (Stockholm), and the UK (Cambridge) this paper examines the organisational and political challenges of growth facilitation in the context of post-Keynesian political and economic restructuring. Particular emphasis is placed on tensions arising from changes in the form and function of European state social regulation. These tensions are not simply a matter of neoliberal regulatory deficit but reflect broader societal cleavages in relation to the uneven spatial impact of local economic growth. Deploying the concept of territorial structures of growth facilitation provides a conceptual framework for taking forward research on the relationship between state spatial regulation, state restructuring, and the competitiveness of city-regions.

AB  - Nestled in the high Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard, the Sveagruva coal mine and mining settlement once buzzed with activity until its closure in 2016. An extraordinary project is now underway to breathe new life into this abandoned place. The Norwegian Parliament and the site owner, the state-owned Store Norske Spitsbergen Kullkompani (SNSK), have taken up the challenge of restoring the area to its original natural state. Recognizing the importance of preserving the history embedded in this site, SNSK partnered up with the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) to undertake the colossal task of documenting the area in 3D. In a race against time, NIKU has employed state-of-the-art technology to meticulously capture the essence of Sveagruva. The result? Mesmerizing visualizations that allow us to witness the site's past glory and honour its legacy.

AB  - Since the early nineteenth century, forest landscapes and socio-economic contexts have significantly changed in northernmost Sweden. These processes include agrarian colonisation, the Christianisation of the indigenous Sami people, and the transfer of land tenure. We aim to analyse how Sami religious practice manifested itself in a time of dramatic social transition in northern Sweden by focussing on the life and religious practice of a Sami woman known as the shaman Guoksik-gummo, 'the Lady of the Siberian Jay.' We analyse a range of historical records and one specific sacred tree related to her to understand this period better and illuminate the changes in land-use religious practice and landscape transformation between the early nineteenth century and the early twenty-first century. We conclude that better documentation, more vital protection by law of Sami cultural traces in northern landscapes, and better consultation with Sami are needed in the future.

AB  - This paper describes a win-win' discourse on local sustainable development and global climate change mitigation regarding Kachung, a Swedish-Norwegian climate forestry investment in Uganda certified under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In many ways, this investment is a typical example of how private interests and capital accumulation are prioritised over local concerns in natural resource management under neoliberalism. This study, however, indicated that investors had genuine intentions of creating mutual benefits for the global environment and local people. Drawing on Li (2007), we show that this will to improve' was nevertheless constructed in ways that resulted in prioritisation of global climate change mitigation over local context-specific concerns.We identify three core factors making the win-win discourse around Kachung plantation especially resilient: (i) the perceived urgency of climate change mitigation, (ii) the apolitical framing of sustainability' as an environmental issue that can be fixed through external technical interventions and (iii) the devaluation of local and context-specific knowledge. We end by suggesting that research on the neoliberalisation of nature focus more on analysing the rationales behind specific interventions. This would leave us better equipped to suggest how such interventions should be modified to produce true wins for local contexts.

KW  - MASCULINITY
AB  - In order to meet the increasing critique of official heritage as elitist and hegemonic, several attempts have been made to become more inclusive, participatory and democratic. The Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage undertook an interesting and surprising move when they decided to grant 12 'everyday' sites Special Protection Orders as a contribution to the Norwegian 2009 Cultural Year. An assumption is that such an approach could represent a particular challenge for heritage experts by broadening the perspective on what to include and exclude in their appraisals. This article examines how one of the chosen sites, an unusual bus shelter, was constructed as official heritage, by critically examining the narratives the heritage authorities produced to sustain their listing of this object. A central argument is that the Norwegian heritage authorities contributed to construct the bus shelter as ostensibly harmless by creating it as a symbol of a rather vague local past, while the object from the outset represents a potentially dangerous and ambiguous object containing lots of complex history. It discusses how the textual construction of the bus shelter's relation to its locality, a small mining community, tends to bolster and reinforce the impression of a masculinist society and a dominant company, and thereby forecloses alternative visions, in contrast with the initial intentions of the everyday perspective on heritage.

KW  - SELECTION
AB  - Capsule By using a GIS-model to identify suitable breeding habitats for Great Snipe in Central Norway, we estimated a total of 276 leks holding approximately 2700 males.
   Aim To estimate the size of the Great Snipe population in central parts of the species remaining breeding areas in Western Europe.
   Methods GIS-analysis identified an area of 528 km(2) as suitable habitat for Great Snipe in the total study area (22 000 km(2)). Complete surveys were made in 8% of these habitats by using a subset of 53 sampling areas.
   Results A total of 28 Great Snipe leks were found within the sampling areas. Ten of these were found in previously known lek areas, while 18 leks were found in areas with no previous knowledge of leks. Extrapolating the lek density and the lek size found in the surveyed areas, resulted in a total estimate of 276 Great Snipe leks holding approximately 2700 lekking males. The leks were found on open fens along the forest edge and were mainly situated on base-rich bedrocks. Mean altitude of the leks was 570 m.
   Conclusion The total population of Great Snipe in Norway was previously assumed to comprise 5000-15 000 lekking males or 'pairs'. By extrapolating the densities of leks found in Central Norway to a national scale, we expect the true breeding population of Great Snipe to be approximately 13 500 males. Changes in the elevation of the tree limit and increased overgrowth, as a result of reduced grazing pressure and/or global warming, are possible threats that may reduce the availability of preferred Great Snipe habitats and increase population fragmentation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is often considered to be the major factor limiting tree growth in northern forest ecosystems. An increased N availability, however, increases the demand for other nutrients such as base cations and phosphorous (P) which in turn may change which nutrient is the limiting factor. If P or base cations become limiting, N will start to leach which means a risk of increased eutrophication of surface waters. As many studies focus on base cations, this study instead aims at estimating P budgets on a regional scale for different harvesting scenarios relevant for Swedish conditions.
   P budget calculations were carried out for 14,550 coniferous sites from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, as weathering+deposition-harvesting-leaching. Three scenarios with different harvest intensities were used: 1) no harvesting, 2) stem harvesting and 3) whole-tree harvesting. The input data were derived from measurements and model results. The P budget estimates indicate that harvesting, especially whole-tree harvesting, result in net losses of P in large parts of Sweden. The highest losses were found in southern Sweden due to high growth rate in this area. In the whole-tree harvesting scenario the losses exceeded 1 kg ha(-1)y(-1) on many sites. N budget calculations on the same sites indicate that N generally accumulates in the whole country and especially in the southern parts. Consequently, the N and P budget calculations indicate that the forests in southern Sweden are in a transition phase from N-to P-limitation to growth. This transition will proceed as long as the accumulation of N continues. These results are important in a sustainable forestry context, as a basis for assessing the risk of future N leaching, and in designing recommendations for abatement strategies of N deposition and for application of wood ash recycling and N fertilization.

AB  - The High Weald is an unusually well-wooded area in southern England. A high proportion of this woodland is ancient, being formerly exploited as seasonal pasture and coppice. Multiple pollen profiles from the Rye area have been used to elucidate the origins of this cultural landscape. By combining sites with small and large pollen source areas, both local and regional patterns of vegetation change have been determined. The mid-Holocene Tilia-dominated woodlands were subjected to temporary clearance as early as the Neolithic. This woodland was more extensively exploited over a ca. 700 year period from the beginning of the Bronze Age. The main elements of the modern landscape (woodland, pasture and limited cultivation) can be traced back to a more intensive phase of human activity, which commenced in the late Bronze Age. A regional increase in Fagus sylvatica pollen ca. 750 B. C. probably reflects the use of the Wealden woods for pasturage. There is no palynological evidence that the fuel demands of the Roman iron industry resulted in widespread woodland destruction. The early Anglo-Saxon period appears to have been one of land- use continuity, with a second increase in Fagus pollen at ca. A. D. 700 corresponding to historical evidence for the presence of wood-pastures in the Weald.

AB  - The aim of this article is to improve knowledge about how directionality is implemented in transformative innovation policy and mission-oriented innovation policy. Academic literature conceptualizes attention to societal challenges as the directionality of innovation systems. Directionality requires an opening-up to include actors from the demand side of innovation processes. But this opening-up raises questions about who determines the direction of transformative change. In Sweden, transformative innovation policy has taken the form of strategic innovation programmes. A case study of one programme, Internet of Things Sweden, provides the opportunity to examine how directionality is implemented. The analysis shows how a focus on demand articulation made it possible to avoid making decisions about the direction of change. Innovation projects that mimicked public procurement limited the potential for radical transformative change. However, policy layering was an enabling factor at the urban level, where regional innovation actors facilitated the participation of urban infrastructure companies.

Patterns of inequality are found in the materials, both within and across groups of users. With youth, health, and mobility in the foreground, older persons and persons with disabilities are almost never evident. Disability is made visible only through its mirror: the ability norm.
   In the review of planning documents from a medium-sized Swedish municipality, the study sought to identify if and how users are described and to analyse which users are included in or excluded from the urban environment during planning stages. The article argues that new ways of thinking, to include a diversity perspective in planning, are needed.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities affect habitat use by Rangifer tarandus, a particularly vulnerable species due to grouping behavior, extensive movements, and grazing ecology. We studied habitat use of GPS-collared reindeer in relation to surface mining activities during the snow-free season in Finnmark, Norway over a period of 7 years. Based on information about the mine's level of operation (amount of people, vehicles, and equipment in operation) and rock blasting schedule, we divided data into high-activity periods (workdays) and low-activity periods (mine closed for ca 2.5 days on weekends and a yearly 3-week holiday period). We further divided workdays into periods with and without rock blasting and associated high-noise days. We found that reindeer significantly reduced habitat use at closer distances to the mine, indicating an influence zone up to 1.5 km. Reductions in use were strongest closest to the mine in high-activity periods. No avoidance effect of the mine was found beyond approximately 0.9 km for the 3-week holidays, 1.0 km for weekends, and 1.5 km for workdays with or without rock blasting. Compared to holidays and weekends, probability of use was reduced by 30-34% within 1.3 km from the mine for workday blasting periods, and up to 35% within 1.4 km for other workdays. Since averted areas can be partly utilized again within days or weeks following intensive mining activity periods, reduced mining activity in crucial periods for reindeer, such as during calving and migration, can be an effective mitigation measure.

AB  - This article explores the use of a dialogue process to approach complex issues related to forest management. An interdisciplinary research team set up an experimental dialogue process concerning the use of introduced tree species in Southern Sweden for the purposes of climate change adaptation. The process involved stakeholders at a regional level, including those with divergent opinions regarding introduced tree species and their use in forestry. Through a process of repeated meetings and exchanges with researchers, the participant's knowledge was deepened and group relationships developed such that the group was able to jointly formulate a set of policy recommendations. The investigation revealed that dialogue processes may improve decision-making by identifying priorities for action or further research. However, when a collaborative process targets complex environmental issues on larger geographical and temporal scales, as matters about forests typically do, a collaborative process must be integrated with external actors and institutions in order to attain tangible outcomes. Consequently, to fully access the benefits of using collaborative processes to handle complex challenges in forest policy and management, the connections between political sphere, the private sector, authorities and research institutions must be concretely established.

AB  - Municipalities play an important role in the development of sustainable societies, particularly by way of public procurement. Within this area, municipal governments can significantly impact the environment by placing environment-conscious demands on the products and services purchased. At the same time, municipalities are largely responsible when it comes to decreasing the fastest growing source of CO2 emissions in urban areas: road transport. Yet, while much has been done to curb the environmental impact of passenger transport, freight transport seems to have been nearly forgotten. Some Swedish municipalities have set a good example by coordinating the distribution of goods to their facilities and by separating the purchases of goods from those of distribution services. Although municipalities claim that cooperation and knowledge dissemination are central to developing sustainability management, it remains unclear how such should be applied to coordinated urban freight distribution. This paper thus aims to describe and analyse activities in Swedish municipalities' developmental processes of promoting the coordinated freight distribution of goods, in order to identify which activities of knowledge dissemination and collaboration should be prioritised. Empirical data were gathered from interviews, the Internet, and brochures for initiatives taken by Swedish municipalities. Results indicate that the initiatives demonstrate several similarities and differences, as well as provide examples of how knowledge can be integrated into municipal organisation. Above all, results indicate a need for increased collaboration among actors to make freight transport in Swedish cities more efficient, as well as that increased knowledge transfer can help municipalities to overcome several of their weaknesses.

AB  - Swedish moose (Alces alces) management has over the years transformed from a situation similar to what Hardin (1968) defined as a tragedy of the commons - i.e. where open access and unrestricted demands lead to over-exploitation - into a situation characterized by an abundance of moose. While high numbers of moose are preferred by hunters, they damage forests through grazing, causing conflicts between hunters and forest owners. In an attempt to resolve these disputes, the Swedish government is introducing a new local ecosystem-based management system. This paper analyzes this shift from managing a single resource to the broader perspective of ecosystem management and discusses to what extent it will contribute to conflict resolution. The results suggest that some of the problems highlighted may be solved through the implementation of an ecosystem management system. However, several challenges remain to be tackled, such as how to establish robust partnerships between forest owners and hunters for managing moose on land with a fragmented property rights structure. This can lead to different and conflicting objectives and, consequently, difficulties in reaching collective action.

AB  - This article employs a narrative approach to explore educators' moral functioning in Finnish preschools. Our study is theoretically inspired by notions drawn from feminist and sociocultural studies, according to which education is understood as an entirely moral phenomenon. Within a holistic framework, moral functioning is understood as a concept that intertwines educators' moral thinking, their actions, the situation, and the cultural context. The study aims to answer the question: What kind of moral functioning emerges from educators' narratives in a Finnish preschool context? Research material was produced from four group interviews and interpreted through narrative analysis. Our findings reveal that four different moral layers evolved, overlapped, and intertwined in educators' narratives: what works in a preschool context; what provides good for people; what the rules say; and what is possible to achieve in an educator's position. We present these findings in detail and discuss their theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical implications.

AB  - Conservation of migratory salmonids requires understanding their ecology at multiple scales, combined with assessing anthropogenic impacts. We present a case-study from over 100 years of data for the endemic landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) and brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae) in Lake Vanern, Sweden. We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vanern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klaralven) and Gullspang (Gullspangsalven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20 kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide. We found that one of four stocks of wild fish has increased since 1996; the other three remain critically low. Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75 metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols. These uncertainties, coupled with a lack of information on their riverine and lacustrine ecology, preclude effective management of these unique populations. We conclude with a framework for a life history-based approach to research and monitoring for Vanern salmon and trout, which should be applicable for all endemic, migratory salmonid populations.

AB  - Environmentally extended input-output analysis is the prevailing method for national environmental footprint accounting; however, its practical usefulness for consumers and policy makers suffers from lack of detail. Several extensive global multiregional input-output (MRIO) databases have recently been released. A standard framework for linking such databases with the highly detailed household expenditure surveys that are conducted regularly by national statistics offices has the potential of providing analysts in countries worldwide with a powerful tool for in-depth analyses of their national environmental footprints. In this article, we combine the Norwegian consumer expenditure survey with a global MRIO database to assess the carbon footprint (CF) of Norwegian household consumption in 2012, as well as its annual development since 1999. We offer a didactic account of the practical challenges associated with the combination of these types of data sets and the approach taken here to address these, and we discuss what barriers still remain before such analyses can be practically conducted and provide reliable results. We find a CF of 22.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per household in 2012, a 26% increase since 1999. Transport, housing, and food were the expenditures contributing the most toward the total footprint. CF per unit of expenditure increased with overall expenditure levels (elasticity: 1.14), notably owing to the correlation between overall household expenditure and transport activities (elasticity: 1.48). Household energy use, which is generally inelastic, is, in Norway, largely based on hydropower and hence contributes comparatively little to the overall expenditure elasticity of household CF.

AB  - Retention forestry has been used for over 20 years to reduce the unfavorable impacts of intensive forest management on biodiversity. The assumed positive effects of retention trees, however, depend on the dynamics of trees in providing substrates or structures for forest-dwelling organisms. In 2000 an experimental study was established to investigate the effects of different retention levels (10 m(3) ha(-1) and 50 m(3) ha(-1)) and fire on tree dynamics. In total, 2758 individually marked, initially living, retention trees were followed on 12 sites in eastern Finland over 10 post-harvest years. Over half (59%) of the total volume of the retention trees died during these initial 10 years, and burning resulted in much higher mortality (84% vs. 34% on unburned sites). At lower retention levels, retention trees did not provide continuity of habitat substrates since all trees died quickly. Fire shortened the tree availability, due to increased tree mortality. However, in higher retention levels, burned areas maintained diverse deadwood substrates for an extended period. Our study proved that tree retention can maintain the continuity of dead wood over early successional stages, if the level of retention is high enough. Fire, combined with higher retention level, created diverse assemblages of dead and living trees. At lower retention levels, however, the effect of fire can be too severe for maintaining living trees or continuity of diverse dead wood. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While coproduction of knowledge is growing in popularity in social sciences, and especially climate change research, we still need to better understand how to coproduce climate knowledge. In this paper, we explore how collaborative climate hackathons coproduce local adaptation knowledge, and what this method reveals about local climate gover-nance. The data derives from two collaborative climate hackathons, called Klimathons, that attracted 73 and 98 par-ticipants in Bergen, Norway. The participants were practitioners and decision-makers from local, regional, and national institutions as well as researchers from natural and social climate sciences. The collaborative group work re-volved around the challenges and solutions of local adaptation planning and uncovered how a diversity of key actors understand the local adaptation work in Norway. These interventions revealed that there are significant disagreements and divergent understanding of relevant laws, regulations and responsibility between practitioners working within the same governance system. Though the cross-sectorial interaction does not dissolve these divergences, they allow actors to renegotiate boundaries between divergent knowledge communities. The Klimathons helped us navigate the com-plexity of local climate adaptation by shifting the focus to how different actors make sense of and work on adaptation and showing the intertwining and interdependence of potential drivers for adaptation.

AB  - Through the lens of liveability and Buen Vivir, I explore how local actors form their acceptance of the physical impact on nature caused by a trail marathon in north-central Sweden, particularly given trail and soil erosion. With a qualitative multi-method research approach, the findings reveal that the local actors minimise the impacts by getting involved in various activities both inside and outside the event. Different knowledge and practices foster sustainability and create acceptance. While the growth of tourism creates unease and feelings of inadequate control, this event is seen as a distinct phenomenon. I show that liveability goes beyond perception and requires integration of the local environment into local practices. Current acceptance may however be eroded if more or larger events occur in the future. Policies and planning must therefore acknowledge and incorporate these local practices to create sustainability.

AB  - Coastal communities have long gathered seaweeds for their own consumption, for animal feed and for fertilizer. The development of industrial use and trade of seaweeds generated income to local communities. The intensification of the exploitation led local communities to implement rules to regulate harvesting. This paper analyses the evolution of seaweed management regimes in four countries: France, Japan, Chile and Norway. Social justice within the communities and equity among gatherers appear to be the basic principles to these rules. Conflict avoidance is their concern much more than resource conservation. This review highlights the role played by fishers' organisations and the processing industries in the management of seaweeds.

AB  - Aim In this paper, we adopted a large-scale approach to evaluate the effect of regional richness of forest birds on the number of bird species retained by forest fragments in several localities across Europe.
   Location We studied bird assemblages in fourteen forest archipelagos embedded in agricultural matrices from southern Norway to central Spain. Tree composition varied from oak and beech forests of the northern localities to oak and pine xerophitic woodlands of the southern ones. The number of fragments in each forest archipelago ranged from eighteen to 211.
   Methods We used the Gleason equation (s = a + z log A; where s and A are, respectively, the species richness and size of forest fragments and z the rate of species loss) to estimate the species richness for 1- and 15-ha fragments in each archipelago. The regional richness of forest birds was estimated by modelling the geographical distribution of species richness in the European atlas of breeding birds.
   Results The latitudinal distribution of regional richness displayed a convex form, with the highest values being in central Europe. Along this gradient, the number of species retained by fragments and the rate of species loss was positively related to regional richness. In addition, the percentage of the regional pool of species sampled by fragments decreased in the southern localities.
   Main conclusions Relationships between regional richness of forest birds and richness in fragments seem to explain why fragments in central Europe shelter more species than their southern counterparts. The decreased ability of southern forest fragments to sample the regional richness of forest birds, could be explained as an effect of the low abundance of many species in the Mediterranean, which could depress their ability to prevent extinction in fragments by a rescue effect. Alternatively, high beta diversity in the Mediterranean could produce undersampling by fragments of the regional pool of species. These regional differences in the response of bird assemblages to forest fragmentation are used to discuss the usefulness of large-scale, biogeographical approaches in the design of conservation guidelines.

AB  - Floods are frequent natural hazards, triggering significant negative consequences for the economy every year. Their impact is expected to increase in the near future due to socio-economic development and climate change. In order to minimize the probability and magnitude of expected economic losses and compensation costs, it is essential that flood risk managers are properly informed about potential damage related to hazard features and exposure. In this paper, a flood damage estimation method was proposed for the assessment of flood risk in the Drammen River basin by using a hydraulic model, GIS, and a flood loss estimation model. Hazard variables such as flood depth, flood extent, and flood velocity were computed for the current and future climatic scenarios using the hydraulic model for flood damage assessment. To visualize the flood extent, velocity, depth, and their impact, the results of modelling are illustrated in the form of flood inundation maps produced in GIS. A flood loss estimate included buildings and other infrastructure that are major exposures in flood-prone areas. The flood damage model is formulated based on stage-damage relationships between different flood depths and land-use categories. It calculates the economic loss related to different land-use features based on the simulated flood parameter obtained from the hydraulic model from 100- to 1000-year return periods. For the case study, the results show that the highest proportion of the total damage in each repetition interval (approximately 90-92%) is expected to occur in buildings. In addition, results showed that the effects of climate change will raise the total damage from floods by 20.26%.

AB  - In the context of climate protection policies, this article addresses the post-carbon transitions driven by a few cities. It investigates the political dimension and multilevel character of these transitions: political, because they gain initial impetus from environmentalist associations, are maintained over time by uncommon political will and give rise to politically divergent transition paths; multilevel, because the upsurge of local climate policies results from the alliance between transnational municipal networks, international institutions and cities, with cross-influences between these levels. Additionally, the analysis of contrasted paths towards exiting fossil fuel followed by two 'pilot' cities (Hanover and Vaxjo), the conditions of their success and limitations encountered, highlights another component of this multilevel character: the weight of national or federal support for local climate action and of influence between political actions performed at different levels, which appear to broaden the scope of urban energy transitions.

AB  - We examined 18 populations of the endangered Euphrasia rostkoviana ssp. fennica situated in managed semi-natural grasslands or gravelled road verges in ten extant localities in south-eastern Sweden. The major threat to the subspecies is the steady decrease in habitat area and quality. In each population, abundance and fecundity of individuals were examined. Local factors (soil pH, litter-layer depth and vascular species richness) and isolation were also measured. We specifically wanted to examine if there was a positive relationship between abundance (population size and density) and fecundity in the investigated taxon. Larger populations of E. rostkoviana ssp. fennica were found to be denser. Population size and density were both significantly positively related to fecundity. A higher variability in seed production was also detected for individuals in sparse populations. An Allee effect, i.e. a reduced fecundity in small and sparse populations, could thus be demonstrated for the already strongly threatened subspecies.

AB  - Young, dense forest in Finland and Sweden urgently need to receive first thinning. In such stands, conventional selective thinning methods make the harvester work time consuming and, thus, costly. To make small-sized trees economically competitive as raw material for bioenergy and biorefining, new harvesting technologies and/or thinning methods need to be developed. A potential solution is boom-corridor thinning (BCT), rendering effective cutting work. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the stand structure of two Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) and one birch-dominated (Betula pendula Roth with natural downy birch, B. pubescens Ehrh.) stand after BCT and selective thinning at the first thinning phase. Furthermore, simulations were conducted to predict the future stand development after the first thinning treatments. The density of the growing stock was 16-46% higher after BCT treatment than after selective thinning because BCT stands included more small and supressed trees with a dbh < 100 mm. However, the numbers of future crop trees with a dbh > 140 nun per hectare were at the same level in both treatments. The stem volume removal per hectare did not differ between treatments. However, simulation of stand development and intermediate thinning and clearcutting revealed that the total removal volume was 10-18% higher in BCT stands compared to selectively thinned ones. The saw log volumes harvested did, however, not differ between treatments. This study shows that BCT generates stands with higher biodiversity compared to conventional thinning as higher levels of biomass removal can be reached throughout stand rotations.

AB  - Current networks of protected areas are biased in many countries toward landscapes of low productivity. Voluntary conservation incentives have been suggested as a socially acceptable way to supplement existing networks with more productive, privately owned areas of high priority for nature conservation. The limited resources committed to nature conservation demand cost-efficiency. Efficiency, however, depends not only on costs incurred to society from alternative ways of maintaining biodiversity but also on ecological values that can be captured. We examined the ecological efficiency of the new market-based voluntary program to preserve forest habitats on private land in southwestern Finland. We compared sites that have become protected (10-year contracts) in the program with managed forests, with sites that have been negotiated for protection for which no contract has been signed, and with the most ecologically valuable privately owned sites in the region that have not been offered for protection by forest owners. We surveyed sites for the amount of dead wood, wood-decomposing fungi, and epiphytic lichens to evaluate their ecological quality. Contracted sites had more features important for overall biodiversity than managed forests and negotiated sites with no contract. These results indicate that procedures used during site selection and negotiations were appropriate and not opportunistic. The contracted sites were also as valuable in ecological terms as the best, still-unprotected, privately owned forests in the region that have not been offered for protection. We conclude that voluntary conservation programs have the potential to yield ecologically valuable sites for protection if the site-selection procedures are appropriate. Reliance on completely voluntary programs, however, may entail uncertainties and inadequacies, for example, in terms of spatial configuration and persistence of the ecological values. Thus, such programs may often need to be supplemented with alternative methods such as land purchase to achieve an ecologically effective network of protected sites.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed an unexpectedly high, cryptic diversity of fungi associated with boreal forest bryophytes. Forestry practices heavily influence the boreal forest and fundamentally transform the landscape. However, little is known about how bryophyte-associated fungal communities are affected by these large-scale habitat transformations. This study assesses to what degree bryophyte-associated fungal communities are structured across the forest successional stages created by current forestry practices. Shoots of Hylocomium splendens were collected in Picea abies dominated forests of different ages, and their associated fungal communities were surveyed by pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons. Although community richness, diversity and evenness were relatively stable across the forest types and all were consistently dominated by ascomycete taxa, there was a marked shift in fungal community composition between young and old forests. Numerous fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed distinct affinities for different forest ages. Spatial structure was also detected among the sites, suggesting that environmental gradients resulting from the topography of the study area and dispersal limitations may also significantly affect bryophyte-associated fungal community structure. This study confirms that Hylocomium splendens hosts an immense diversity of fungi and demonstrates that this community is structured in part by forest age, and as such is highly influenced by modern forestry practices.

AB  - The large share of carbon emitted by energy-intensive industries in the extraction and processing of basic materials must be limited to decarbonise society and the economy. Ways in which the state can govern industrial decarbonisation and contributes to green state theory are explored by addressing a largely ignored issue: the green state's industrial relations and its role in industrial governance. With insights from a Swedish case study, the tension between the state's economic imperative and ecological concerns in greening industry are shown to persist. However, as the energy-intensive industry's previously privileged position in the economy is weakening, industry is opened to decarbonisation strategies. While the case exposes a number of governance challenges, it also suggests potential areas where the state can pursue decarbonisation in energy-intensive industry and points the way to an active role of the green state in governing industrial decarbonisation and greening industry.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies have shown conflicting results regarding the role of traffic pollution in the development of allergic disease. This study investigated the relationship between living close to traffic and ever dispense of prescribed oral antihistamines or nasal anti-allergic medication, among young children. The underlying aim was to investigate if children growing up close to traffic pollution are at higher risk of developing allergy in early childhood.
   Methods: We investigated a birth cohort in southern Sweden, consisting of N = 26 128 children (0-6 years) with health outcome and exposure data. Of these children, N = 7898, had additional covariate information. Traffic intensity and yearly averages of dispersion-modeled concentrations of NOX (100 x 100 m grid) at residential addresses, were linked with registry data on dispensed allergy medication (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register). Individual level covariate information was obtained from questionnaires distributed to parents at Child Health Care-center visits, eight months after birth. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for the statistical analyses.
   Results: Living in close proximity to a road with equal to or greater than 8640 cars/day (compared to 0-8639 cars/day), was not associated with higher incidence of ever dispensed oral antihistamine or nasal anti-allergic medication, with or without adjustment for confounders (sex, breastfeeding, parental allergy, parental origin, season, and year of birth). Similar results were found in relation to NOX.
   Conclusions: Traffic-related exposure was not associated with higher incidence of ever dispensed medication against allergy, in children 0-6 years in southern Sweden. These results indicates that traffic-related exposure may not be a risk factor for early onset allergy in children in southern Sweden. However, children with dispense of prescribed allergy medication may be a selected subgroup, and the results for this group may not be generalizable to all children with allergy.

AB  - Species richness of vascular plants and birds were examined in relation to five types of management (including abandonment) of oak-hazel woodland in south-central Sweden. The biodiversity of this type of woodland is affected by lengthy management in contrast to present emphasis on the fragmentation of more or less pristine forests. The woodlands derive from old deciduous forests but were a source of agricultural commodities from medieval time to end of the 19th century. Vascular plants and birds were censused during spring-summer for four years. Total number of plant species, species of field layer forbs, breeding birds and migrant birds were more numerous at simulated original management with mowing of small interior grasslands than at mechanical clearing or abandonment. Summer grazing led to intermediate numbers. Exotic plants were more common at long-time abandonment. Species richness of trees and shrubs, graminoids, all spring birds, resident birds and non-passerine birds did not exhibit any difference between treatments. Inter-site variation in species richness was usually smaller at abandonment than at true management. Species richness of plants and birds showed positive correlation in the particularly large sites examined. The general findings were in accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Original management would secure most potential plant and bird species but extensive cattle grazing would also retain many species.

AB  - Globally, transportation and manufacturing emit large amount of greenhouse gases that needs to be lowered for reaching agreed upon slim ate goals. In this context evidence of mitigation activities among eighty-five companies and their forty-five parent companies in these two polluting sectors were traced focusing on a country that has committed itself to leading the implementation of ambitious climate mitigation goals worldwide. Documentation from the companies in the transportation and manufacturing sectors was scrutinized (yearly reports, homepages and sustainability reports, if available) for evidence of any mitigation efforts, including emissions reporting and reduction goals. The study's results found that two thirds of the companies seemed to have done nothing to mitigate climate change, while efforts in the remaining companies were modest at best; mitigation activities among the forty-five parent companies were only slightly more ambitious. The implications of these depressing findings are discussed in the light of possible caveats and the possibilities of new policy measures such as gender quotas in company boards. The conclusion is that the study's results most likely reflect reality in the studied sectors and that novel approaches and more sector oriented research is needed in the quest for a carbon-neutral society.

AB  - Focus groups were carried out in Austria, Finland, France, Norway, and Sweden to understand building professional's and laypeople's perceptions of building materials and well-being in indoor environments. Focus groups asked participants to share their opinions and experiences related to seven main topics: choosing interior materials, naturalness, naturalness for building materials, wellbeing in the indoor environment, wood materials, cleanabililty, and ethics and environment. The main objective of the focus groups was to explore how the use of wood is perceived in the interior environment and suggest opportunities for use of wood in the built environment. Participants' responses can be linked to the physical properties of wood: density/hardness, grain, thermal conductivity, moisture content, chemical composition, color, and natural origin. Based on the discussion, these physical properties can be related more closely to the perception of wood as a natural material with respect to intended use, such as visual and tactile products. Based on the findings, it is also possible to alter product properties to enhance users' experience of wood in the interior built environment. The results also indicate that the relevance and trustworthiness of the current schemes for documenting sustainable forestry practices, is questionable.

AB  - Until recently it had been widely accepted that birds are energetically adapted to the latitude they inhabit, having an increased basal metabolic rate (BMR) at higher latitudes. Latterly, this general view has been questioned and the influence of phenotypic flexibility, due to factors such as habitat, life-history or acclimatization has received increased attention. In particular, focus has been directed towards comparing species from arid and mesic habitats, but less attention has been given to species which breed in cold climates. We chose to study northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe from two populations at different latitudes (southern Norway, Iceland), but with similar life-histories and habitat requirements throughout the year, in a common-garden experiment. In order to assess true latitudinal trends in metabolic rate, we estimated the nocturnal resting metabolic rate (RMR) of northern wheatears from southern Norway and Iceland at different temperatures from 0 degrees to 30 degrees C. We found that Norwegian birds had overall lower metabolic rates than Icelandic birds, which were also slightly larger. This difference was not observed at 0 degrees C, which might indicate that Icelandic birds might rely on better feather insulation reducing metabolic costs at very low temperatures. At temperatures above 10 degrees C birds of both populations had constant metabolic values, indicating that their thermoneutral range almost completely covered the temperatures experienced during the breeding period. This study shows that the northern wheatear, which is one of only a few insectivorous long-distance migratory songbirds occurring at such high latitudes, has evolved metabolic adaptations to life at cold temperatures which are endogenously determined.

AB  - Background Pasture management influences the prevalence and impact of the pasture parasites (PP) in cattle herds, which cause production-limiting disease worldwide. Evaluating farmer management strategies is vital when considering sustainable PP control practices. The aim of this questionnaire-based study was to describe the pasture management and control strategies regarding PP in Norwegian beef cattle (BC) and dairy cattle (DC) production systems with a focus on gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and Fasciola hepatica. Results A total of 745 responses from BC (return rate 20.5%) and 1347 responses from DC farmers (30.7%) were included. The mean total pasture time for DC was 4.2 months for first-season grazers and 4.3 months for second-season grazers and cows, while the corresponding finding in BC was 5.4 months. Home pasture was used for most of the pasture period, particularly for first-season grazer dairy heifers (81%), which were also commonly grazed on the same pasture every year (79%). For most farmers it was necessary for grazing areas to be used for cattle for more than one season (77% of BC farmers and 89% of DC farmers). However, changing the pasture during the season was common in both DC (67%) and BC (70%) herds. The majority of DC farmers (60%) stated that they did not consider that they had a problem with PP. Of the remaining 40%, few respondents could specify whether their herds had a problem due to infection by GIN (11%) or liver flukes (12%). Treatment for GIN was performed by 52% of DC and 34% of BC farmers. Diagnostic faecal samples were collected upon suspicion of parasitic disease by 5% of DC and 16% of BC farmers. Veterinarians were stated as a central source of information about parasite management and treatment. Conclusions Potential risks for exposure to PP were identified, such as use of the same pasture every year for first-season grazers and frequent use of home pasture. The perception of problems related to PP appeared low. Regular anthelmintic treatment without concurrent use of diagnostic faecal samples seems to be common practice.

AB  - Forests with their high surface area and forest management practices have an important impact on hydrological processes at the atmosphere land interface. Since 1948, water fluxes have been studied in different compartments of the Lange Bramke catchment, Harz Mountains, Germany, which was completely clear-cut in 1947 and reforested with Norway spruce. The catchment is characterized by a humid climate. Water budgets for the period 1950-2008 have been simulated using the hydrological model WaSiM-ETH, which was coupled to a forest growth model for the estimation of stand characteristics. As adaptation options to climate change, the conversion from drought sensitive Norway spruce stands to less sensitive European beech and different thinning regimes have been simulated until 2050. Discharge of Lange Bramke has decreased since 1948 due to a combined effect of forest development and climatic changes. Tree transpiration will likely further increase until 2050 (due to projected climate change) resulting in higher risk of drought stress. Conversion of Norway spruce stands to European beech and intensified thinning would result in reduced drought stress and increased discharge.

AB  - Genetic mixed-stock analysis (MSA) of wild lake-run brown trout Salmo trutta fishery catches (n = 665) from the Inari Basin (northern Finland) between 2006 and 2008 was carried out using a previously characterized baseline with 30 populations (n = 813) and 13 microsatellite loci. Altogether, 12 populations contributed significantly to mixed-stock fisheries, with the Ivalojoki system being the major contributor (70%) to the total catch. When catches were analysed regionally, geographically nearby populations were the main contributors to the local catches, indicating that a large proportion of S. trutta occupy lacustrine areas near the natal river mouth rather than dispersing throughout the lake. Similarly, far upstream populations contributed insignificantly to catches. These findings have important implications for the conservation and sustainable fishery management of the Inari system.

AB  - Most European ungulate species are increasing in numbers and expanding their range. For the management and monitoring of these species, 64% of European countries rely on indirect proxies of abundance (e.g., hunting bag statistics). With increasing ungulate numbers, data on ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) may provide an important and inexpensive, complementary data source. Currently, it is unclear how bag statistics compare with UVC. A direct comparison of these two indices is important because both are used in ungulate management. We evaluated the relationship between UVC and ungulate hunting bags across bioclimatic, regional, and local scales, using five time lags (t(-3)to t(+1)) for the five most common wild ungulate species in Sweden. For all species, hunting bags and UVC correlated positively, but correlation strength and time lags varied across scales and among species. The two indices correlated most strongly at the local management scale. Correlation between both indices was strong for the smaller deer species and wild boar, in particular, but much weaker for moose where we found the best fit using a 2-year time lag. For the other species, indices from the same year correlated best. We argue that the reason for moose data behaving differently is that, in Sweden, moose are formally managed using a 3-year time plan, while the other species are not. Accordingly, moose hunting bags are influenced more strongly by density-independent processes than bags of the other species. Consequently, the mismatch between the two indices may generate conflicting conclusions for management depending on the method applied.

AB  - In Norway, agricultural subsidies have, since the late 1980s, been targeted to reduce soil erosion, transfer of soil particles and phosphorus (P) losses. The subsidies led to, e.g., a fourfold increase in the area not ploughed from 1991 to 2001 and a reduced P fertiliser consumption by 60%, especially in areas with high livestock density. Moreover, in the late 1980s agricultural point sources of P from storage facilities of manure and fodder were reduced. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of these policy-induced measures and changed agricultural practices on suspended sediment (SS) and total P (TP) concentrations in three agricultural catchments (1, 3 and 87 km). Results from the statistical trend analyses for the study period (14-17 years) showed weak, but statistically significant (p < 0.05), downward trends in concentrations of TP and SS in the two streams with a high initial TP or SS concentration. In the stream with low initial concentrations of TP and SS, however, no statistically significant trends were shown. The stream with the highest initial concentration of SS showed a statistically significant downward trend in both, TP and SS concentrations. The catchment with low initial concentration of SS and medium livestock density showed no detectable trends, while the catchment with high livestock density and low concentrations of SS in the stream showed a statistically significant downward trend in TP concentrations. The results from this study suggest that subsidies and mitigation measures can reduce concentrations of TP and SS in streamwater in highly polluted catchments, although the reduction is small compared to the variations. between catchments.

AB  - Cold-adapted species are thought to have had their largest distribution ranges in central Europe during the glacial periods. Postglacial warming caused severe range shifts of such taxa into higher latitudes and altitudes. We selected the boreomontane butterfly Lycaena helle (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) as an example to demonstrate the genetic effects of range changes, and to document the recent status of highly fragmented remnant populations. We analysed five polymorphic microsatellite loci in 1059 individuals sampled at 50 different localities scattered over the European distribution area of the species. Genetic differentiation was strong among the mountain ranges of western Europe, but we did not detect similarly distinct genetic groups following a geographical pattern in the more eastern areas. The Fennoscandian populations form a separate genetic group, and provide evidence for a colonization from southern Finland via northern Scandinavia to south-central Sweden. Species distribution modelling suggests a large extension of the spatial distribution during the last glacial maximum, but highlights strong retractions to a few mountain areas under current conditions. These findings, combined with our genetic data, suggest a more or less continuous distribution of L. helle throughout central Europe at the end of the last ice age. As a consequence of postglacial warming, the species retreated northwards to Fennoscandia and escaped increasing temperatures through altitudinal shifts. Therefore, the species is today restricted to population remnants located at the mountain tops of western Europe, genetically isolated from each other, and evolved into genetically unique entities. Rising temperatures and advancing habitat destruction threaten this wealth of biodiversity. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 101, 155-168.

AB  - An underground car park for 537 cars was constructed 1995-1997 in a new suburb built in the district of Herttoniemi, in eastern Helsinki, Finland. The car park was designed and equipped for use as a civil defence shelter for 9000 persons to serve the population of the area in time of need. The building of an underground car park in rock allowed more efficient land use and avoided fragmentation of housing developments typified by surface car parks. An underground solution at the same time produced rock rubble needed for other development areas acid helped reduce the total investment cost. The car park comprises six single story parking halls, five pedestrian entrances and a single vehicle ramp linking to the local road network. The total excavated volume is 77,489 m(3) and the total floor area is 17,706 m(2). Construction was completed in 24 months, as a result of the use of modem construction methods. A thorough ground investigation programme, careful consideration of 'buildability' and detailed rock mechanics calculations meant that work on site proceeded without any unexpected problems.

AB  - Inorganic chemicals in urban stormwater and snowmelt runoff originate from catchment geology and anthropogenic activities. The occurrence, partitioning and mobility of six minerals and six trace metal (TM) indicators of anthropogenic activities were studied in stormwater, snowmelt and baseflow in four urban catchments, and the sampling of inorganics was supplemented by measurements of electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total suspended solids (TSSs). Minerals occurred at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher (1-10(2) mg/L) than those of TMs (10(-2)-10(2) mu g/L) and reflected the composition of local groundwater seeping into sewers. Concentrations of Ca, K, Mg and Na were enhanced by baseflow contributions and followed closely the electrical conductivity. Al and Fe minerals occurred in insoluble forms, and their pollutographs were similar to those of TMs, whose concentrations mimicked, to some extent, the flux of TSS. The TMs with the highest and lowest particulate fractions were Cr&Pb and Cu&Zn, respectively. The concentrations of total TMs in snowmelt were two to four times higher than those in stormwater, and both sources likely exceeded some of the stormwater effluent limits (for Cd, Cu and Zn) proposed in Sweden. Where such concentrations depended on water hardness, the risk of toxicity might be reduced by elevated hardness of the monitored snowmelt and stormwater. Recognizing the good ecological status of the study area receiving water, Lake Storsjon, some protection against polluted runoff and snowmelt may be needed and could be achieved by implementing stormwater management measures controlling TSS and TMs.

AB  - The urgency of a sustainability transition in the energy sector has led numerous authors to argue that it can and should be accelerated through active phase-out, disruption and destabilization of the undesirable established technologies. This paper starts out accepting the phase-out premise, but argues that a more nuanced view of 'established' technologies and incumbents is needed. Technologies often involve many different sectors, and there may be a great but underappreciated potential to realize transitions through recombinations and diversification by upstream firms providing the components and material inputs for the undesirable technology. Recombination and diversification can also dampen the possible negative effects of transitions such as loss of jobs and bankruptcy of firms that are not at the core of these technologies. By combining literature on transitions and phase-out, technological innovation systems, and diversification, we develop a framework of analysis that is used to study diversification processes in supplier firms in the Norwegian offshore petroleum technology value chain. We find that these firms face a number of diversification challenges that are mostly non-technological. These findings are used to discuss how policies can better support diversification and how theories of sustainability transitions can take this perspective into account.

AB  - Many saproxylic insects (insects dependent on deadwood) are threatened because the amounts of suitable substrate, coarse woody debris (CWD), are low in managed forests. Harvesting clear-cut stumps for bioenergy will decrease these amounts further and may therefore contribute to loss of biodiversity. Earlier studies have demonstrated that many saproxylic beetle species utilise clear-cut stumps. However, the importance of stumps compared with other kinds of deadwood remains unknown. In particular, some species adapted to sun-exposed deadwood created by disturbances might, in managed forest landscapes, be dependent on stumps in clear-cuts. In the present study we quantify the proportions of landscape-wide populations of saproxylic beetles that are recruited from clear-cut stumps in a managed boreal forest landscape. The amount of bark on clear-cut stumps and population densities (beetles per m(2) bark) were estimated for a 24,499 ha landscape in Sweden. Our data were pooled with estimates from a similar study in the same landscape, including all other types of CWD and beetle densities. The clear-cut stumps were estimated to contribute 15.5% of total bark to CWD in the landscape. For spruce, clear-cut stumps contributed 37.9% of the total bark. Of 39 analysed beetle species, 13 were estimated to have more than 10% of their populations in clear-cut stumps, 9 more than 50%, and 5 more than 80%. Clear-Cut stumps are thus an important breeding substrate for many beetle species and consequently, intensive stump harvest risks decreasing biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the economic literature on fisheries there is a long tradition of presenting the role of private property rights in efficient and sustainable fisheries management. We contribute to the literature by analyzing the market value of one of the world's most well defined fishing rights: the ownership of Swedish property where the fishing rights are an inseparable part of the real estate that can be traded in an open market. The fishing rights are primarily used for recreational fishing. For real estate that includes dwellings and vacation homes, the estimated value of these rights is about SEK 60,000 (about 6300), in 2016 prices. This corresponds to 4.5% of the average real estate value. However, the values are heterogeneous, and for real estate with agricultural and/or forestry land the value of the rights is less than SEK 10,000. This could be due to forest owners (as opposed to vacation home owners) primarily view the real estate as a means of generating economic returns, and the potential for this is low for fishing. The valuation of the right is expected to be a determinant of engagement in resource management and is thus important in the development of public policies for both the fish resource and recreational fisheries.

AB  - Unobserved diversity, such as undetected genetic structure or the presence of cryptic species, is of concern for the conservation and management of global biodiversity in the face of threatening anthropogenic processes. For instance, unobserved diversity can lead to overestimation of maximum sustainable yields and therefore to overharvesting of the more vulnerable stock components within unrecognized mixed-stock fisheries. We used DNA from archival (otolith) samples to reconstruct the temporal (1976-2011) genetic makeup of two mixed-stock flounder fisheries in the angstrom land Sea (AS) and the Gulf of Finland (GoF). Both fisheries have hitherto been managed as a single stock of European flounders (Platichthys flesus), but were recently revealed to target two closely related species: the pelagic-spawning P. flesus and the newly described, demersal-spawning P. solemdali. While the AS and GoF fisheries were assumed to consist exclusively of P. solemdali, P. flesus dominated the GoF flounder assemblage (87% of total) in 1983, had disappeared (0%) by 1993, and remained in low proportions (10%-11%) thereafter. In the AS, P. solemdali dominated throughout the sampling period (>70%), and P. flesus remained in very low proportions after 1983. The disappearance of P. flesus from the GoF coincides in time with a dramatic (similar to 60%) decline in commercial landings and worsening environmental conditions in P. flesus' northernmost spawning ground, the Eastern Gotland Basin, in the preceding 4-6 years. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that P. flesus in the GoF is a sink population relying on larval subsidies from southern spawning grounds and the cause of their disappearance is a cessation of larval supply. Our results highlight the importance of uncovering unobserved genetic diversity and studying spatiotemporal changes in the relative contribution of different stock components, as well as the underlying environmental causes, to manage marine resources in the age of rapid anthropogenic change.

AB  - WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) models are used in very high spatial resolution (200 m) to simulate urban metabolism. Due to the high spatial resolution of the simulations, it is possible to have a detailed picture of the soil atmosphere exchange fluxes and understand the impact of different urban planning alternatives in the urban environment from a meteorological and air quality point of view. Relation between urban metabolism and urban structure can be described with information of energy, water, and pollution. There are many challenges of the sustainable urban planning. with regards to the above components (for example to optimize energy efficiency of urban structure, to minimize primary water consumption, to minimize the emissions to atmosphere, reduce air pollution, etc.) This information can be extracted from meteorological and air pollution models.
   Meteorological fluxes (WRF/UCM) are calculated over London (UK), Athens (Greece), Gliwice (Poland), Helsinki (Finland) and Florence (Italy) and air pollution concentrations (CMAQ model) over Athens and Florence. The work was developed into the BRIDGE "Sustainable urban planning decision support accounting for urban metabolism" FP7 (Seventh Framework Programme) EU (European Union) funded project to analyze and study the impact of urban metabolism with different alternatives in urban planning scenarios. The implemented models have been run over the five European cities for full year 2008 and 2010 summer period over two domains. It was necessary to prepare different sets of input data. In general the model when running with very high spatial resolution - produces good results although the quality in slightly reduced. Some numerical stability could be involved in the very high spatial resolution run.

AB  - Recently, resilience has been highlighted in tourism studies. This article examines resilience through a social innovation framework which includes identifying the needs for and envisioning ways of building resilience, emphasizing collaboration, and co-creating outcomes. The aim is to explore the role of social innovations in local resilience-building. Ethnographic insights are drawn from Kemi, Finland, where tourism is faced with challenges, which has created visions of how tourism could develop differently. Tourism actors' needs and visions regarding tourism t and perceptions on cooperation are analyzed with a case of a tourism diversification project on the island of Laitakari. It is concluded that a social innovation framework can help in conceptualizing resilience-building and potentially enhance the sustainability of tourism. This can take place by enhancing diversification and inclusion of local culture, constructing multi-sectoral and communal dialogue, and identifying environmentally friendly visions for long-term resilience. The Laitakari case demonstrates this kind of development process.

AB  - The gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Baltic Sea is flourishing. On the one hand, this can be interpreted as successful conservation management but, on the other, the gray seal has also become a persistent problem for small-scale coastal fisheries. Departing from the appraisal theory of emotion, this case study investigated local people's appraisals of the current situation of small-scale fishery and seals in three fishing villages. Survey results and interviews showed that the fishery-seal situation is perceived as being highly relevant, with negative implications, and local communities and fishers lack the tools to tackle the challenges. Successful management requires not only attention to local context and stakeholder groups, but also to people's individual interpretation or appraisal of the situation. Place-specific coping strategies should be sought, to balance the seal population with the promotion of small-scale fisheries as a sustainable local industry and as a cultural heritage.

AB  - Diversity in flood risk management approaches is often considered to be a strength. However, in some national settings, and especially for transboundary rivers, variability and incompatibility of approaches can reduce the effectiveness of flood risk management. Placed in the context of increasing flood risks, as well as the potential for flooding to undermine the European Union's sustainable development goals, a desire to increase societal resilience to flooding has prompted the introduction of a common European Framework. We provide a legal and policy analysis of the implementation of the Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) in six countries: Belgium (Flemish region), England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden. Evaluation criteria from existing legal and policy literature frame the study of the Directive and its effect on enhancing or constraining societal resilience by using an adaptive governance approach. These criteria are initially used to analyze the key components of the EU approach, before providing insight of the implementation of the Directive at a national level. Similarities and differences in the legal translation of European goals into existing flood risk management are analyzed alongside their relative influence on policy and practice. The research highlights that the effect of the Floods Directive on increasing societal resilience has been nationally variable, in part because of its focus on procedural obligations, rather than on more substantive requirements. Analysis shows that despite a focus on transboundary river basin management, existing traditions of flood risk management have overridden objectives to harmonize flood risk management in some cases. The Directive could be strengthened by requiring more stringent cooperation and providing the competent authorities in international river basin districts with more power. Despite some shortcomings in directly affecting flood risk outcomes, the Directive has positively stimulated discussion and flood risk management planning in countries that were perhaps lagging behind.

AB  - Egg predation is an important determinant of breeding success among boreal forest grouse, but the relative roles of mammalian and avian predators are poorly known. During spring/early summer of 2010, predation on artificial nests was studied by placing nests on the ground and on 1.5-m tall poles at two forested areas. One study site was highly fragmented due to intensive forestry (Varaldskogen, Norway) and the other site was a pristine, natural forest in north-western Russia (Pinega Forest Reserve). The nests on poles were subject to predation by birds and those on the ground by both mammals and birds. Total predation was significantly higher in Varaldskogen than in Pinega. Ground nests suffered ca. 2.5 times higher losses than nests on poles. In Pinega, predation did not differ between the two nest types. The difference between the two areas was probably due to different predator guilds: mammalian generalist predators, such as the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Badger (Meles meles), were common in Varaldskogen but scarce or absent in Pinega. Canopy cover explained most of the variation in predation rate in Varaldskogen, but no significant relationship with canopy or nest concealment was detected in Pinega. Predation on pole nests varied across habitat types in a similar manner at the two areas, but predation on ground nests did not. As Raven (Corvus corax) and Hooded Crow (Corvus corone cornix) were rare in both areas, these findings suggest similar searching and predatory behaviour of the two main (smaller) corvids, the Eurasian Jay (Garrulus glandarius) in Varaldskogen and the Siberian Jay (Perisoreus injaustus) in Pinega. Although the study design allowed a comparison between avian and mammalian nest predators, the lack of a clearer relationship between predation and certain variables suggests that nest predation is a complex process involving components of predator behaviour.

AB  - It is widely known that governance is central to the successful implementation of sustainable development policies and measures. Yet, there is a paucity of research which explore the links between governance and sustainability. This paper attempts to address this research need by providing an analysis of the role of governance in enabling and to some extent fostering a transition towards sustainable societies. A set of indicators for assessing the capacity for and willingness and commitment to transition to a more sustainable society is presented, enabling identification of direction of change. This paper presents the results of a study, in the context of which sustainability governance has been comparatively investigated in a sample of European countries with, by methodological purpose, very different economic, environmental, political and social conditions (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). Lessons learnt and examples of good practice which may be replicable elsewhere-are outlined. For instance, it is discussed that limited knowledge about sustainable development amongst municipal development planners and decision-makers, deficiencies in policy integration, intersectoral cooperation, municipality and stakeholder cooperation and urban management practices are major reasons for weak governance practices in sustainable development. Furthermore, some recommendations on the role of sustainability governance are made, so as to allow the integration of the principles of governance into sustainability practice and hence provide a more general basis upon which a transition towards sustainable societies may become a reality in different types of European countries and societies. The scientific value of this paper lies in identifying opportunities for integrating principles of governance into sustainability practice, as well as outlining the basis for sustainability transitions, providing a general picture of required policy measures. The paper offers a unique comparative analysis of sustainability governance in the Baltic Sea countries, outlining some of the challenges in sustainability governance in the Baltic Sea region.

AB  - To address global food demand and sustainability challenges, aquaculture has appeared as an essential element in food systems, and an increasing number of national aquaculture policies have emerged over the past decades. However, several of these policies have failed because of an often-argued inability to anticipate their far-reaching implications on environmental and socio-economic variables. To tackle this gap, we propose a step-wise framework to assess the national environmental impacts from aquaculture industries with a prospective and systemic approach. Starting from identifying policy-based national targets, the methodology relies on economic equilibrium modeling to develop realistic future-oriented scenarios of the aquaculture sector, and couples them with life cycle assessment principles. To evidence its operability, we apply the framework to two distinct case countries: Norway and Singapore. Beyond our key findings from the analyses of the policies in both countries, we observed that feed production and usage are important drivers of impacts, hence calling for new and more environmentally-friendly feed options. Our results additionally show that the development of aquaculture following existing governmental policies may not directly reduce greenhouse gases emissions and, hence, not support climate change mitigation objectives. These findings should however be cautioned as potential shifts of diets due to the increasing seafood availability might occur, leading to indirect environmental benefits. We therefore advocate the further expansion of our framework to cover the entire food system, so it can integrate such indirect effects. Meanwhile, we recommend its interim application to support policy-making and help move towards more environmentally sustainable aquaculture systems.

AB  - The derogation to use a percentage of cheaper non-organic feeds in organic livestock diets for herbivores expired from January 2008. (in Norway, a maximum of 15% conventional feedstuffs per year was allowed until 24 August 2005, 5% in the interim.) This study aimed to assess changes in resource use and financial impacts for organic dairy herds of the 100% organic feeding rule (compared with 85% organic feeds) using a two-stage stochastic programming modelling framework. In this study, the objective function was to maximise expected net income. Two organic dairy farms in the lowlands of southern Norway, both having a milk quota of 100,000 1 but with varying farmland availability (37 ha vs. 20 ha), were examined. Furthermore, situations with and without possibilities to buy organic silage were studied. Milk production per cow was highest on the farm with the most strict land constraint For farmers that fully utilise the non-organic feed allowance, the more expensive organic feeds determine the marginal feed cost Hence, a removal of the non-organic feed allowance will not influence optimal farm practice (provided that marginal milk production is still profitable). A switch from conventional to organic concentrates as the only adjustment was found on the 37 ha farm and also on the 20 ha farm if there was no possibility to buy some organic silage. On the 20 ha farm with possibilities to buy organic silage. it turned out to be unprofitable to keep all the cows. Fewer cows resulted in several other changes in the model solution such as a lower milk yield per cow, less milk produced in total and more work off-farm. The financial gain from carrying out the optimal management changes was. however, very small. In all cases studied, the introduction of 100% organic feeds resulted in an economic loss of NOK 19,200-23,600 (or 7-12% of the expected net income with 85% organic feeds). The economic losses were due to the price premium of organic concentrates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Great cormorants of the continental subspecies (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in the Baltic and North Sea increase, while local cod (Gadus morhua) stocks decline. In contrast, numbers of the Atlantic subspecies (Phalacrocorax carbo carbo), breeding along the Norwegian and Barents Seas, have been relatively stable. We investigated the diet of both great cormorant subspecies in breeding colonies along the Norwegian Coast from Lofoten to the Skagerrak and estimated the biomass of fish consumed annually by great cormorants in Norwegian waters. The birds' consumption was compared with estimated fish stock sizes and fishery catches. Cod and saithe (Pollachius virens) dominated the diet in the Norwegian Sea and wrasses in the North Sea and Skagerrak. Estimated total fish consumption of cod and saithe by great cormorants was <1.7% of estimated fish stocks and <9% of that of human catches and therefore considered minor. Cormorant consumption of wrasses amounted to 110% of human catches. The practice of using wrasses as cleaner fish in the salmon farming industry leads to a conflict with cormorants, and we urge for a better understanding and management of wrasse populations, taking ecosystem functioning and natural predation into account.

AB  - Climate change is a potential threat to society and business. Although research has noted that the tourism sector may be robust on the macro scale, significant losses at local levels have been suggested. This paper examines Upper Norrland, in Northern Sweden, by measuring the perceptions of winter-oriented tourism entrepreneurs. Their perceptions of potential threats from climate change are assessed, including how entrepreneurs view the future, in terms of climate change impacts and sustainability of the region as a winter-tourism destination. A quantitative survey of entrepreneurs (n = 63) gave responses along geographical and operator dimensions to reveal local differences within the Upper Norrland region, showing the coastland to be perceived as more exposed to change than inland areas. Venue-based businesses see climate change as a higher priority than activity-based, potentially mobile, businesses, regardless of their location. The general perception among businesses is that climate change will not drastically impact the tourism sector over the next 10 years. A basic model for mapping local differences is outlined to stimulate further study of the under-researched intra-regional nuances in climate change and tourism research. A case is made for regional planners to use this tool and to educate local businesses on adaptation techniques.

AB  - Effective ocean management requires integrated and sustainable ocean observing systems enabling us to map and understand ecosystem properties and the effects of human activities. Autonomous subsurface and surface vehicles, here collectively referred to as "gliders ", are part of such ocean observing systems providing high spatiotemporal resolution. In this paper, we present some of the results achieved through the project "Unmanned ocean vehicles, a flexible and cost-efficient offshore monitoring and data management approach-GLIDER ". In this project, three autonomous surface and underwater vehicles were deployed along the Lofoten-Vesteralen (LoVe) shelf-slope-oceanic system, in Arctic Norway. The aim of this effort was to test whether gliders equipped with novel sensors could effectively perform ecosystem surveys by recording physical, biogeochemical, and biological data simultaneously. From March to September 2018, a period of high biological activity in the area, the gliders were able to record a set of environmental parameters, including temperature, salinity, and oxygen, map the spatiotemporal distribution of zooplankton, and record cetacean vocalizations and anthropogenic noise. A subset of these parameters was effectively employed in near-real-time data assimilative ocean circulation models, improving their local predictive skills. The results presented here demonstrate that autonomous gliders can be effective long-term, remote, noninvasive ecosystem monitoring and research platforms capable of operating in high-latitude marine ecosystems. Accordingly, these platforms can record high-quality baseline environmental data in areas where extractive activities are planned and provide much-needed information for operational and management purposes.

AB  - Urbanization has paved the way for the spread of commensal rodents at global scale. However, it is largely unknown how these species use tropical anthropogenic landscapes originally covered with forests and inhabited by diverse small mammal assemblages. We surveyed non-flying small mammals in various urban and suburban habitat types and adjacent forest in the tropical town of Kota Kinabalu in Borneo. We used occupancy and polynomial regression models to determine variation in species occurrences along gradients of land-use intensity. Muller's sundamys (Sundamys muelleri) was the only native small mammal species found in urban and suburban landscapes with a continuous decrease in occurrence probability from forests to urban habitats. The invasive Asian black rat (Rattus rattus species complex) and the invasive Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) had the highest occurrence probabilities in habitats of intermediate land-use intensity, but Asian black rats are also likely to occasionally invade forested habitats and occupied urban habitats in sympatry with the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). In urban and suburban habitats, fallow land possibly favoured the occurrence of S. muelleri and S. murinus. Other native small mammal species (Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae) were found only in forested areas. Our study shows that native small mammals found in forest are largely replaced by invasive species in urban and suburban habitats. Due to their occurrence in habitats of various land use intensities, S. muelleri and R. rattus comprise central links between forest wildlife and urban species, an association that is important to consider in studies of parasite and disease transmission dynamics.

KW  - environmental systems analysis
KW  - policy attention
AB  - Not all environmental problems get the same level of policy attention. An interesting question is thus why certain aspects receive attention and others do not. This paper studies the level of policy attention given to different environmental aspects in agriculture and energy policy in Sweden and explores empirically some factors that can explain the level of attention. The first step was to explore the link between environmental issue characteristics and the level of policy attention. The level of policy attention was measured through a content analysis of Swedish government bills. The results from the content analysis are clear and stable over the studied time period. In the agriculture sector biodiversity and toxicity are in focus whereas in the energy sector climate change and resources are given the attention. Besides these aspects, the attention is limited. These results were compared with the results from sector-wide environmental assessments of the same sectors. These assessments were based on hybrid input-output analysis and life cycle assessment methodologies. A main finding from the study is that issue importance is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for policy attention. Other explanations are needed to understand which environmental issues get attention in sectoral policy. Our assessment showed that while the level of knowledge does not provide an explanation, the presence of strong and well-organised stakeholders within the sector, with an interest in having a certain issue on the agenda, might be decisive for issue attention. Path dependency and limited attention capacity are other important factors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The number of horses in Sweden has increased, from 77 300 in 1970 to 283 000 in 2003 (ca. 250%). These horses are kept on 300 000 ha, which represents 10% of total agricultural land in Sweden. Maximum recommended livestock density in Sweden is 2.5 units/ha for grazed pasture, but no limits have yet been set for outdoor keeping and feeding areas (paddocks) for horses. This study characterized the potential risk of phosphorus (P) losses from a horse paddock established on a heavy clay soil with a stocking rate of 3.75 livestock units/ha compared with nearby arable land. The horse paddock received 15 kg P/ha/yr and 75 kg N/ha/yr through horse excreta, while annual input of P and N to the adjacent arable land was 13 and 112 kg/ha, respectively. There was no significant difference in water-soluble P (WSP) in fresh and dried soil samples between the horse paddock (mean values: 0.62 and 0.43 mg/100 g soil; n = 15) and the arable field (mean values: 0.52 and 0.37 mg/100 g soil; n = 5). In contrast, phosphorus extractable in ammonium acetate lactate (extractable P) in the topsoil of the horse paddock (mean: 15 mg/100 g soil) was significantly higher (P = 0.03; n = 15) than in the arable land, whereas total P extracted with nitric acid (total P) showed no statistically significant differences. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in lactate-extractable iron and aluminium (extractable Fe and Al), organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) or phosphorus sorption index between the two parcels of land. However, the degree of P saturation in soil was significantly higher (P = 0.02; n = 15) in the horse paddock. Extractable Al and Fe were highly correlated to extractable P (P < 0.001; n = 69), the correlation being negative for Al. No relationship was found with calcium, but soil C content was found to be correlated with extractable P (P < 0.001; n = 69). Over the past 8 yr, high P concentrations (up to 1.5 mg/L), mainly in dissolved reactive form, have been recorded in drainage water from the grazed catchment. We concluded that horse grazing at high stocking rates (> 2.5 livestock units/ha) may pose a risk of high P losses to nearby water bodies.

AB  - Solar access describes the capacity of urban spaces to receive sunlight and daylight. Rapid urbanization and unbridled densification pose a threat to sustainable solar access, reducing the penetration of sunlight and daylight into cities. To effectively assess solar access at such an early design stage, at the urban planning level, it is critical that evaluation metrics are simple and reliable. This paper examines a cross section of solar metrics, from simple to more complex ones, to find potential solar performance indicators for urban planning evaluations. The metric datasets were created based on iterations of homogeneous neighbourhood designs, based on the three commonest typologies in the Swedish context: courtyard, slab, and tower. The results were validated using case studies sampled from districts of Malmo. The findings indicate that simple geometrical and latitudinal metrics may be suitable for assessing the solar access of urban designs due to high correlation with built density. Potential performance indicators aimed at indoor and outdoor evaluation of daylighting (VSC, SVF) and sunlighting (ASH_F, RD_G) in urban planning stages were suggested. Possible methods of applying the provided metric database into assessments were proposed. Future work should find evidence-based thresholds for the metric values to establish performance benchmarks.

AB  - This paper reports on the findings of a forthcoming book on Transboundary Risk Management in Europe (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. forthcoming). An important motivating question for this book is how the emerging risk management processes and institutions of the European Union can avoid the crises in governance and loss of trust in governing institutions that have characterized local risk debates throughout Europe and North America. This question is explored through case studies, which include: the European acid rain negotiations, Swedish aid to the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania, and the conflict on the Danube River over the Gabcikovo hydropower station, the BSE crisis, the current furor over trade in genetically modified food. By drawing on these studies, this paper describes issues and challenges in managing trans-border risks and concludes by proposing a more deliberative and participatory process for transboundary risk management in Europe.

AB  - Sites connected to the Second World War (WWII) are increasingly recognized as worthy of archaeological investigation. Researchers are also becoming aware that that the collectors market in objects connected to WWII, particularly those connected to Germany, is encouraging the stripping of conflict landscapes in the search for "collectors items." Finnish Lapland is sometimes regarded as peripheral compared to more centrally located regions of Europe. Archaeologists working here nonetheless find themselves in direct competition with enthusiastic treasure hunters. This is complicated even further by the myriad ontologies employed by different individuals in the construction of their relationship with the material culture connected to recent conflict periods, and on specific "other" or "exotic" landscapes, such as Lapland. This paper examines what might be learnt about the nature of treasure hunting for and trading in WWII material from Lapland, and its position within the emerging research on broader trends in "dark" approaches to and encounters with heritage.

AB  - An anticipatory life cycle assessment of ovalbumin produced using cellular agriculture demonstrates sustainability gains with limited trade-offs, particularly when produced using low-carbon energy sources.
   Ovalbumin (OVA) produced using the fungus Trichoderma reesei (Tr-OVA) could become a sustainable replacement for chicken egg white protein powder-a widely used ingredient in the food industry. Although the approach can generate OVA at pilot scale, the environmental impacts of industrial-scale production have not been explored. Here, we conducted an anticipatory life cycle assessment using data from a pilot study to compare the impacts of Tr-OVA production with an equivalent functional unit of dried chicken egg white protein produced in Finland, Germany and Poland. Tr-OVA production reduced most agriculture-associated impacts, such as global warming and land use. Increased impacts were mostly related to industrial inputs, such as electricity production, but were also associated with glucose consumption. Switching to low-carbon energy sources could further reduce environmental impact, demonstrating the potential benefits of cellular agriculture over livestock agriculture for OVA production.

AB  - The inherent complexity of the environment is such that attempts to model it must operate under simplifications and assumptions. Considering predictions from alternative models, with a range of assumptions and data requirements, therefore provides a more robust approach. The intractability and uncertainty resulting from a suite of predictions may hinder the application of science in policy, where a single prediction with little ambiguity or uncertainty would be most desirable. Few studies modelling species' distributions attempt to present multi-model outputs in a format most useful to the non-modelling community, and none of these have done so for the marine environment. The problem of uncertainty is particularly prevalent in predicting the distribution of invasive alien species under climate change. As invasive alien species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and may incur significant economic costs, the benefit of applying predictions to highlight areas of possible establishment and inform policy and management may be large. An ensemble prediction is used to assess the distribution of suitable habitat for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, in UK waters both currently and in the future. The ensemble incorporates predictions from three species distribution models, using data from two global climate models. A method is developed highlighting the agreement of the ensemble, further applying threshold values to retain information from constituent predictions in the final map of agreement. Ensemble predictions made here suggest that Pacific oyster will experience an opening of suitable habitat in northern UK waters, reaching the Faroe Islands and the eastern Norwegian Sea by 2050. Habitat suitability will increase with warming temperatures in the English Channel and Central North Sea for this species. The approaches applied here can be incorporated into risk assessment frameworks for invasive species, as stipulated in the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB  - In rural Valdres, Norway, the traditional regional dialect, called Valdresmal, has become an important resource for popular style and local development projects. Stigmatized through much of the twentieth century for its association with poor, rural, "backward" farmers and culture, Valdresmal has been thoroughly revalorized, with particularly high status among local youth and those involved in business and tourism. While today's parents and grandparents attest to historical pressures to adopt normative urban linguistic forms, many in Valdres now proclaim dialect pride and have re-embraced spoken Valdresmal in various forms of public, interdialectal communication. In addition, Valdres natives also make abundant and creative use of dialect on social media, the primary locus for written Valdresmal and for emergent orthographic norms representing local speech, including strategies of maximal sociolinguistic distinction. This innovative use of written Valdresmal has been taken up by local businesses as a marketing strategy in recent years, as well, further normalizing and legitimating nonstandard forms. In the ongoing revalorization of traditional Valdresmal, it is also, inevitably, transformed-linguistically, socially, and ideologically-as it enters and circulates within new and innovative cultural domains: while widespread written Valdresmal challenges the normal sociolinguistic order, in such a process the dialect is also refunctionalized and, perhaps, increasingly standardized.

LA  - English
AB  - The correlation between natural (meteorological, hydrological), mining-technological, hydrogeological and geochemical factors in the oil shale mining region in the Purtse catchment area for the period of 1990-1998 was studied. As a result of the interactions between these factors (correlation coefficients r=0.56-0.86), a so-called hydrogeological circulation of water has formed in the catchment area. It was found that the circulation flow forms 25-40% of the total amount of mine water pumped out from the mines at present. On the basis of average data, a new balance scheme of water circulation (cycles) for the Purtse catchment was developed. Under the influence of different water flows a new, anthropogenic biogeochemical matter cycling from the geological environment into the aquatic environment of the rivers has formed in this catchment area. The pollution of the Purtse River from oil shale thermal processing is combined with the harmful impact of oil shale mining. The anthropogenic hydrochemical conditions arising in the rivers of this catchment will not disappear even after oil shale mining stops. A multiple regression formula was derived for prognosticating the flow regime (mean annual discharge) of the Purtse River using meteorological and mining-technological data.

AB  - Reconstructing land cover from pollen data using mathematical models of the relationship between them has the potential to translate the many thousand pollen records produced over the last 100 years (over 2300 radiocarbon-dated pollen records exist for the UK alone) into formats relevant to ecologists, archaeologists and climate scientists. However, the reliability of these reconstructions depends on model parameters. A key parameter is Relative Pollen Productivity (RPP), usually estimated from empirical data using 'Extended R Value analysis' (ERV analysis). Lack of RPP estimates for many regions is currently a major limitation on reconstructing global land cover. We present two alternatives to ERV analysis, the Modified Davis Method and an iteration method, which use the same underlying model of the relationship between pollen and vegetation to estimate RPP from empirical data, but with different assumptions. We test them in simulation against ERV analysis, and use a case study of a problematic empirical dataset to determine whether they have the potential to increase the speed and geographic range of RPP estimation. The two alternative methods are shown to perform at least as well as ERV analysis in simulation. We also present new RPP estimates from southeastern sub-tropical China for nine taxa estimated using the Modified Davis Method. Adding these two methods to the 'toolkit' for land cover reconstruction from pollen records opens up the possibility to estimate a key parameter from existing datasets with less field time than using current methods. This can both speed up the inclusion of more of the globe in past land cover mapping exercises such as the PAGES Landcover6k working group and improve our understanding of how this parameter varies within a single taxon and the factors control that variation.

AB  - Forest site productivity, usually represented by site index (SI), is a fundamental resource variable in forest management planning as it is a quantitative measure of the production capacity of forest land. Site index is usually derived from estimates of dominant height (H-dom) at a given reference age using empirical age-height curves. However, it is commonly quantified with large uncertainty in forest management inventories, resulting in economic losses due to incorrect management decisions. In this study, we used bitemporal airborne laser scanner (ALS) data acquired for a study area in southeastern Norway with a time interval of 15 years to estimate SI by means of an area-based approach. We present two practical methods for SI determination, i.e., the (1) direct and (2) indirect method. With the direct method, we regressed field observations of age-height SI against canopy height metrics derived from ALS data from the first point in time and changes in ALS metrics reflecting canopy height growth during the observation period. With the indirect method, we first modelled H-dom for the two points in time using the respective ALS metrics as predictors. We then derived SI from the initial H-dom the estimated H-dom increment, and the length of the observation period using empirical SI curves. We used bitemporal field data collected from 80 georeferenced sample plots of size 232.9 m(2) to fit the species-specific regression models for SI and H-dom. We then applied the models to an independent dataset comprising 42 georeferenced validation plots of size similar to 3700 m(2), for which ground reference values were collected at both points in time, to assess the precision of both methods. Both the proposed methods produced SI estimates with satisfactory precision. For the direct method, the independent validation revealed root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 1.78 and 1.08 m for Norway spruce and Scots pine, respectively, compared to 1.82 m obtained for both tree species using the indirect method. The indirect method can provide a good alternative to the direct method as field observations of SI are not required to calibrate the regression models.

AB  - Lichen is a major forage resource for reindeer and may constitute up to 80% of a reindeer's winter diet. The reindeer grazing area in Sweden covers almost half of the country, with reindeer using mountainous areas in the summer and forested areas in the winter. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of ground lichens is important for both practical and sustainable decision-making purposes. Since the early 1980s, remote sensing research of lichen cover in northern environments has focused on reindeer grazing issues. The objective of the present study was to use lichen information from the Swedish Forest Inventory (NFI) for classification of satellite data into ground lichen classes. The classification procedure was focused on using of NFI plots as training sets for supervised classification of the ground lichen cover in purpose to classify areas with different lichen coverage. The present research has shown the advantage of use forest inventory plot data by assessment of three methods: mahalanobis distance (MD) classification, maximum likelihood (ML) classification and spectral mixture analysis (SMA). The results of this study demonstrate high classification accuracy of SPOT imagery in distinction between lichen-abundant and lichen-poor areas by mahalanobis distance classifier (overall accuracy 84.3%, kappa=0.68). The highest classification accuracy for Landsat scene was achieved by maximum likelihood classification (overall accuracy 76.8%, kappa=0.53). The continuation research on more detailed fragmentation of lichen cover into fractions is proposed.

AB  - This study investigates the cost balance between heat energy savings through building envelope retrofits and supply from low-carbon decentralised and centralised technologies in a generic urban district, composed of residential and non-residential buildings from the 1970-1989 construction period. For generalisability, the district is analysed in three European countries (Bulgaria, Germany, Finland), each with distinct weather conditions and price levels. Using bottom-up energy modelling and adopting a societal perspective that includes external costs, the study finds the cost-effectiveness of retrofits to be context-specific. In Bulgaria, retrofits prove largely cost-effective, whereas in Germany and Finland, high labour and material costs pose challenges. Heat pumps, whether decentralised in buildings or centralised in district heating systems, emerge as key options for heat supply, even in cold climates. The study underscores the importance of integrated energy planning in line with the 'energy efficiency first' principle and corresponding incentive structures to promote sustainable urban energy systems.

AB  - The implementation and monitoring of fish health regulations vary extensively in aquaculture throughout the world. In the main salmon-producing countries, there is strict regulatory oversight of the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Such controls have supported the sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry and, in Norway, aquaculture has been able to reduce its total consumption of antibiotics by more than 99% between 1995 and today, yet there has been a 20-fold rise in production volume. Other countries on other continents may have less control, with no mandatory prescription regulations and variable quality of the pharmaceutical products available. A good regulatory framework, with control and monitoring systems, should be established in all countries where aquaculture is practised and veterinary medicinal products should only be available under veterinary prescription and supervision. Many drug resistance genes have been identified, and molecular methods should be applied to control drug resistance in the microbial and parasitic populations of all major aquaculture-producing regions.

AB  - The article addresses the simple but pertinent question of why ambitious urban planning visions slowly lose a significant share of their aims during the implementation phase and why there often occurs a significant time span between vision and implementation. Using the development of the deindustrialised Norra Sorgenfri neighbourhood in central Malmo, Sweden, as an example, the author enquires into why developing the area became so complicated, and why the original vision, with its focus on social sustainability, largely disappeared despite private developers having invested in land acquisition in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Based on document analysis of the vision for Norra Sorgenfri from 2006 and the subsequent planning programme from 2008, as well as interviews with planners and property developers, this article seeks to highlight the mechanisms due to which the implementation of the Norra Sorgenfri plans differs from original visions and strategies, as well as examine why the process was so slow. The authors conclude that the planning office's 'visioning' becomes powerless in the face of 'property-led regeneration' where private developers have most of the decision-making power, and that the 'social sustainability' ideal cannot be achieved through physical regeneration alone.

AB  - Regions have been regarded as processes, artefacts and discourses, and recently as 'brands' that various stakeholders use in marketing. Discourses on institutional regions are typically promoted by media, governmental bodies and planning organizations that draw on reputed collective regional identities-the expressions of past and current social discourses and cultural practices. However, such institutional regional discourses are often incongruous to spatial imaginaries of everyday life. This article scrutinizes the meanings of spatial attachment to citizens and explores to what extent regional identities are meaningful in everyday life. To avoid biased assumptions, focus-group interviews were carried out within four Finnish provinces among the members of four social movements. The results show that provincial spaces are not actively thought-and-practiced. Spatial identities are rather structured around personal experiences that typically accumulate in several locales, since personal histories are increasingly characterized by mobility. This article also recognizes that the everyday meanings of a socially constructed region are often generationally read and combine different historical narratives.

AB  - The presence of plants within square metre plots and of their pollen in moss samples within the same plots was recorded in mowed and grazed vegetation types in western Norway. The relationship between plant and pollen presences was quantified using association, over-and under-representation indices. Each taxon was related to its mode of pollination and characteristics of the flowers as well as to the size of its pollen grain. A pattern was found for anemophilous species and for species with open blossoms and numerous freely exposed anthers. These had the best association between the presence of the pollen and the plant. Their pollen was also found more often in the pollen assemblages than in the vegetation, and their pollen grain sizes are most often less than 40 mu m. Entomophilous species with few freely exposed anthers or concealed anthers were found to have a good association between plant and pollen presences or, most often, they were under-represented. Different pollen grain sizes are connected to this group. These results indicate that the presence of pollen of specialized entomophilous taxa and of pollen of taxa with open flowers, but few anthers reflect local occurrence in the vegetation. Their presence may therefore be important in interpreting land-use practices in pollen diagrams from soil profiles, whereas pollen percentages must be taken into account in interpreting the occurrence of pollen of anemophilous taxa and entomophilous taxa with open flowers and numerous exposed anthers from soil deposits.

AB  - Rates of introgression from non-indigenous into native populations are increasing worldwide, often as a result of anthropogenic translocation events. In ungulates translocations have been common, especially among deer. European red deer consists of two distinct lineages, one western and one eastern. These probably originate from different glacial refuges, but it is unknown to what extent they hold different adaptations. Here we address dispersal and introgression into the Norwegian mainland population from an introduced island stock consisting of an admixture of both European lineages. The last decade this stock has grown considerably in number and dispersal could be expected to have increased. We therefore used samples separated by a 5 year interval from Otteroya, adjacent mainland areas and a more distant sub-population. Bayesian assignment analysis verified the genetic structure and identified dispersal between the Otteroya stock and the adjacent mainland coastal areas. Three individuals (two newly sampled) with second or third generation non-indigenous origin were found among the adjacent mainland samples (5 and 3 %, respectively). Two individuals with first and second generation mainland-origin were found on Otteroya (old samples). This suggests some non-indigenous introgression from Otteroya into the mainland Norwegian population.

AB  - The effects of land-use history on plant species richness were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands in SW Finland. Using generalized additive models, we studied the total number of species, number of species of dry and mesic grasslands and number of rare species of dry and mesic grasslands of 162 grazed or abandoned grassland patches. We studied only grasslands that had remained totally or mostly treeless despite of abandonment. Increase of solar radiation was positively correlated with all three richness variables. Increasing cover of trees had a negative effect on the total species richness and that of rare grassland species. Total species richness and richness of grassland species declined with increasing time after abandonment, but richness of rare species did not show a similar response. The results emphasize the importance of high solar radiation, grazing and tow cover of trees for plant species richness in mesic semi-natural grasslands in northern Europe. According to our results the increase in the cover of trees after the end of grazing may be more detrimental to grassland plants than the lack of grazing per se. (c) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The EU strategy for rural development 2014-2020 proposes a focus on tourism as a solution to bring economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable development together. Using the case of fishing tourism in Sweden, we discuss the marketization of sustainable development on a destination market. We focus on the discursive and practical tension between ambitions for development and maintenance. In a two-step analysis, we problematize the win win consensus of sustainable tourism discourse in relation to different stakeholders' competing uses of limited resources in practice. We show how stakeholders understand the stakes of sustainable tourism as either lost opportunities for development due to failed regulation of a natural resource, or as deteriorating social relations due to failed maintenance of socio-cultural values. We argue for the acknowledgement of social complexity in market theoretizations in order to transfer sustainable tourism from the agenda of business potential and traditional marketing to the domain of participatory politics.

AB  - Does the concept of maritime cultural landscapes bridge a division between land and sea, or does it maintain a gap that perhaps doesn't even exist? This paper discusses maritime and maritime cultural landscapes as phenomena in the light of Actor Network Theory, where maritimity is given attention as a derivation of the modern metaphysics as described by Bruno Latour. The paper makes use of a case study from Norwegian Cultural Heritage Management (CHM), where land and sea archaeologists meet each other in a joint venture project at the island of Smola, More & Romsdal County.

AB  - To map the image foreign markets have of Norway as a winter tourist destination, and the Lillehammer region in particular, we surveyed 1000 respondents from Sweden, Denmark and Germany. We identified six key experience attributes that winter tourists seek: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, general destination criteria, children-friendliness, other activities and snow. Two image-dimensions were identified: (1) friendly and safe and (2) thrilling. Danes had the highest score on the friendly and safe dimension, while Germans scored highest on the thrilling dimension. Whereas cognitive dimensions of destination image appeared to be of overall importance to Swedes in particular, the affective dimensions were strongest among German respondents. The model best explaining knowledge about the Lillehammer region included the following predictors: number of former visits to Norway during winter, home country (Swedes highest, Germans lowest) and personal interest in visiting snow destination for winter vacation. Differences among the three national markets relate to geographical and cultural distance and prior knowledge. While no large marketing challenges seem to exist in terms of mismatch between images held and destination characteristics, an untapped potential exists, especially with respect to German travelers, from developing marketing strategies that more clearly addresses different preferences between these main markets.

AB  - Our research focused on the impact of post-disturbance management on the subsequent forest stands in the territory of the High Tatra Mts. situated in the northern part of Slovakia. The field work was carried out within the post-disturbance area in 2019, i.e., 15 years after the windstorm. In total, we used data from 80 monitoring plots (MP): 40 plots situated inside the managed part and 40 in the unmanaged areas. Post-disturbance management specifically consisted of logging of wind-thrown wood; therefore, the main difference between the two areas (salvaged versus unsalvaged) was the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD) left on site. We focused on the characteristics of newly regenerated forest stands: the number of trees and tree species per MP, tree height and browsing (mostly by red deer, Cervus elaphus) were recorded as was their growth substrate, i.e., soil or CWD. Higher tree densities, larger trees as well as higher tree species richness were found at salvaged plots. In addition, more evident dominance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) was recorded at unsalvaged plots. Common rowans (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were frequent at both plot types. Birch trees (Betula sp.) were very frequent at salvaged plots, while only a few birch individuals were recorded at unsalvaged ones. The proportion of trees growing on CWD was 15% at unsalvaged and 3% at salvaged plots. Trees growing on the soil contained nearly double the aboveground biomass than those on CWD. Red deer browsing was approximately two times more frequent at salvaged than unsalvaged plots. While rowan was extremely prone to browsing, spruce was damaged negligibly. These main findings could have two contradictory conclusions, the positive one being that differentiated post-disturbance management within a certain area can combine both forestry and nature conservation interests. Moreover, it can generate parallel forests with different properties that might positively influence the future stability of forest ecosystems as a whole. The negative side might be that contrasting post-disturbance management can cause an uneven distribution of red deer population and intensive browsing in areas favourable for game.
