AB  - The global biodiversity crisis and constantly growing human impact on the natural environment call for more evidence where conservation actions are the most urgent. As the agricultural lands are under increased pressure of growing human food needs here the literature survey on farmland bird conservation (FBC) was conducted to reveal geographical distribution in research intensity, the topics addressed and to identify potential drivers for the worldwide scientific effort. The Scopus database search has revealed 2290 papers dedicated to FBC from the period 1990-2020. The distribution was spatially uneven with most papers published in Western Europe and North America. Scientific collaboration was also spatially biased in favor of countries located close to each other and having high scientific capacity. The analysis also revealed 139 terms representing main topics raised in FBC research. The number of FBC papers per country was positively correlated with Gross Domestic Production (GDP), the total number of scientific papers, and number of threatened species, and negatively with the GDP from agricultural production, whereas it was not related to area of agricultural lands or bird species richness. Spatial and thematic biases in studies of farmland birds may have important consequences since uneven scientific evidence constrains development of proper conservation solutions and limits their implementation. We conclude that research on FBC should be globally coordinated and flexible enough to undertake burning conservation problems adjusted to regional differences in agriculture, socio-economy, and bird diversity.

AB  - This paper argues that attempts to transform Australia's urban environment into a sufficiently sustainable one has been misdirected. The 'green rating tool,' industry's adherence to relevant standards and governmental policies represent the primary means of effecting the sustainability transition.
   However, only high-profile commercial building owners seem interested in being green-rated; the actual end-users of buildings are far less committed (e.g. employees ensconced in commercial buildings and residential home occupiers). Through a systematic review of 103 journal articles published on the topic of end-users and sustainability transition, original findings are presented. The findings reveal that most residential end-users do not purchase green homes and without their 'buy-in,' sustainability transition across Australia will continue to fail. This paper offers a critical analysis of the status-quo, identifying where the effort to generate a sustainable urban environment has been misdirected, what challenges prevail, and why residential end-users have been overlooked. In looking for a way forward that engages end-users, the paper proposes that financial incentives for the purchase of low-carbon buildings must be introduced into the residential real-estate market. And the modeling for this rebate is discussed in terms of emissions trading schemes or carbon tax. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A healthy riparian ecosystem is essential to maintain instream water quality, decrease stream bank erosion, increase bank stability and prevent soil loss within river systems, which in turn may affect coastal water quality. The presence of cattle within the riparian zone is a common feature of grazing ventures, but can negatively impact on the functionality of riparian ecosystems. Therefore, the provision of offstream watering points (OSWPs) as an alternative watering source for cattle may lessen or prevent the impact cattle have on the riparian zone. A systematic review was conducted to identify: 1) which factors influence how cattle use OSWPs, and 2) if the provision of an OSWP is an effective best management practice to reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, potentially limiting the impact cattle may have on instream water quality and riparian habitat particularly stream bank vegetation. A total of 37 from 1135 research papers satisfied the initial selection criteria for the review with seven providing sufficient information to conduct a meta-analysis. Out of the 37 papers a total of seven factors and five sub-factors influencing cattle's use of OSWPs were identified. There is evidence that OSWPs did reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, however with great variation (63.7%) among studies. The review further highlights that substantial knowledge gaps exist within the literature linking the interaction of cattle, OSWPs and riparian habitats indicating the need for further research.

AB  - Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an advanced bioelectrochemical technique that can utilize biomass materials in the process of simultaneously generating electricity and biodegrading or bio transforming toxic pollutants from wastewater. The overall performance of the system is largely dependent on the efficiency of the anode electrode to enhance electron transportation. Furthermore, the anode electrode has a significant impact on the overall cost of MFC setup. Hence, the need to explore research focused towards developing cost-effective material as anode in MFC. This material must also have favourable properties for electron transportation. Graphene oxide (GO) derivatives and its modification with nanomaterials have been identified as a viable anode material. Herein, we discussed an economically effective strategy for the synthesis of graphene derivatives from waste biomass materials and its subsequent fabrication into anode electrode for MFC applications. This review article offers a promising approach towards replacing commercial graphene materials with biomass-derived graphene derivatives in a view to achieve a sustainable and commercialized MFC.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles will significantly affect mobility conditions in the future. The changes in mobility conditions are expected to have an impact on urban development and, more specifically, on location choices, land use organisation and infrastructure design. Nowadays, there is not enough data for a real-life assessment of this impact. Experts estimate that autonomous vehicles will be available for uptake in the next decade. Therefore, urban planners should consider the possible impacts from autonomous vehicles on cities and the future challenges for urban planning. In this context, the present paper focuses on the challenges from the implementation of autonomous road vehicles for passenger transport in European cities. The analysis is based on a systematic review of research and policy. The main outcome of the analysis is a set of challenges for urban planning regarding the features of urban development, the local and European policy priorities, the current lack of data for planning and the potential for autonomous vehicles to be used by planners as data sources. The paper concludes that tackling these challenges is essential for the full exploitation of the autonomous vehicles' potential to promote sustainable urban development.

AB  - This research was designed to evaluate our current state of knowledge by systematically reviewing tourism and hospitality academic literature concerning sustainability in the restaurant sector by undertaking a systematic review and content analysis. The characteristics of 76 articles are listed in a comprehensive table, presenting research design and research variables, and the articles are examined for their approach to the sustainability concept as applied to the restaurant industry (i.e. the range of responsible practices addressed in each work). The findings indicate that the majority of the literature only engages with parts of sustainability, particularly ecological, rather than holistic sustainability. This matters because it may mean we fail in our attempts to achieve more sustainable restaurant operations. This research suggests that tourism and hospitality studies need to re-engage with the evolving conceptualisation of sustainability to ensure that best practice responses to changing requirements are undertaken. The narrow focus on ecological aspects of sustainability featuring in restaurants does not acknowledge the full meaning of sustainability and therefore may constrain efforts to secure more sustainable futures. Illuminating such gaps in knowledge is important in order to strengthen our conceptual understandings, refine our practices and thereby secure more sustainable futures through tourism and hospitality.

AB  - Currently, there are many different interpretations in the literature of what a circular economy is and how it functions. As cities are still facing challenges to become fully sustainable, the need for a comprehensive analysis of how the circular economy can be implemented in urban areas is increasing. This article aims at outlining circular cities by their key characteristics and to further explore and provide a framework for fostering circularity at the city level. In order to achieve this goal, we performed a systematic review and analyzed key papers published in the field of circular economy to determine how circular economy practices form circular cities. We discovered that cities play a focal role in facilitating the transition towards circularity through the closing of the loops, recirculation, technical innovation, policy elaboration and citizens' support. However, city policymakers are still uncertain about how a circular city looks like and what its purpose is, as views are ranging from a strategic ambition to a niche concept of a smart city. Such uncertainty brings challenges, especially in the transition phase that many cities are in at the moment. This further implies that circular economy applied at the urban level still needs effort and innovation to successfully pass the transition phase from the linear economy. Therefore, lastly, we developed a framework model that can be adapted in other cities to facilitate their transition to circular cities.

AB  - As supply chain risk management has transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area, there is a need to classify different types of research and examine the general trends of this research area. This helps identify fertile research streams with great potential for further examination. This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative and analytical models (i.e. mathematical, optimization and simulation modeling efforts) for managing supply chain risks. We use bibliometric and network analysis tools to generate insights that have not been captured in the previous reviews on the topic. In particular, we complete a systemic mapping of the literature that identifies the key research clusters/topics, interrelationships, and generative research areas that have provided the field with the foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques. Some of our findings include (1) quantitative analysis of supply chain risk is expanding rapidly; (2) European journals are the more popular research outlets for the dissemination of the knowledge developed by researchers in United States and Asia; and (3) sustainability risk analysis is an emerging and fast evolving research topic.

AB  - Debate about what proportion of the Earth to protect often overshadows the question of how nature should be conserved and by whom. We present a systematic review and narrative synthesis of 169 publications investigating how different forms of governance influence conservation outcomes, paying particular attention to the role played by Indigenous peoples and local communities. We find a stark contrast between the outcomes produced by externally controlled conservation, and those produced by locally controlled efforts. Crucially, most studies presenting positive outcomes for both well-being and conservation come from cases where Indigenous peoples and local communities play a central role, such as when they have substantial influence over decision making or when local institutions regulating tenure form a recognized part of governance. In contrast, when interventions are controlled by external organizations and involve strategies to change local practices and supersede customary institutions, they tend to result in relatively ineffective conservation at the same time as producing negative social outcomes. Our findings suggest that equitable conservation, which empowers and supports the environmental stewardship of Indigenous peoples and local communities represents the primary pathway to effective long-term conservation of biodiversity, particularly when upheld in wider law and policy. Whether for protected areas in biodiversity hotspots or restoration of highly modified ecosystems, whether involving highly traditional or diverse and dynamic local communities, conservation can become more effective through an increased focus on governance type and quality, and fostering solutions that reinforce the role, capacity, and rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities. We detail how to enact progressive governance transitions through recommendations for conservation policy, with immediate relevance for how to achieve the next decade's conservation targets under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB  - Mountains are critical ecosystems that have a strong influence far beyond their topographic boundaries. More than 50 million people inhabit the Himalayas, and more than one billion people depend on the ecosystem services they provide. Anthropogenic activities have driven concurrent deforestation and regeneration in the Himalayas, and interventions to reduce forest loss and promote forest recovery require a synthetic understanding of the complex and interacting drivers of forest change. We conducted a systematic review of case studies from 1984 to 2020 (n = 137) and combined a system dynamics approach with a causal network analysis to identify, map and articulate the relationships between the drivers, actors and mechanisms of forest change across the entirety of the Himalayan mountain range. In total, the analysis revealed five proximate drivers, 12 underlying drivers, two institutional factors and five 'other' factors connected by a total of 221 linkages. Forest change dynamics have been dominated by widespread smallholder agriculture, extensive non-timber forest product extraction, widespread commercial and non-commercial timber extraction, and high rates of agricultural abandonment. Underlying drivers include population growth, poor agricultural productivity, international support for development projects, and successful community forest management systems. Contradictory linkages emerge from a combination of contextual factors, which can have negative impacts on conservation goals. Global processes such as shifts in governance, transnational infrastructure-development programs, economic slowdowns, labor migrations and climate change threaten to destabilize established dynamics and change forest trajectories. The underlying and proximate drivers interact through multiple pathways that can be utilized to achieve conservation goals. Based on this analysis, we highlight five thematic focus areas to curtail forest loss and promote recovery: (1) decreasing the population pressure, (2) sustainable increase of agricultural productivity, (3) strengthening of forest management institutions, (4) leveraging tourism growth and sustainable infrastructure expansion, and (5) fuel transition and establishing firewood plantations on degraded land. The broader adoption of systems thinking, and specifically a system dynamics approach and causal network analysis, will greatly enhance the rigour of policy development, help design site-specific interventions at multiple spatial scales which can respond to local and global changes, and guide deeper inquiry to enhance our understanding of driverforest dynamics.

AB  - Modern zoos and aquariums have evolved greatly since the end of the Second World War, to become centres of conservation excellence and scientific institutions for the study of animal behaviour, ecology, husbandry management. Whilst the impact of zoos and aquariums to biodiversity conservation, population management and advancement of species care is well documented, their positive impacts on society (including the communities that they are located within) is less well known. The four established aims of the modern zoo-Conservation, Education, Recreation (Engagement) and Research-provide a strong foundation for wider review and critique of the societal value of zoos and aquariums. This article synthesises what such value may be, and how it could be measured, from a systematic review of the literature pertaining to each of these four established aims. It also recommends areas of future scientific inquiry to further study the wider impact of zoos on their local communities and on human populations and behaviour more generally. Including Wellbeing as a fifth aim of the modern zoo would also cement their wider societal value. Further scrutiny of the societal value of the modern zoo enhances the value of the zoo's living collection and the green spaces that it manages to provide accessibility to biodiversity and nature-centric education essential to long-term, planetary friendly human behaviour change.

AB  - The intent of the current research is to put forward a set of research areas for recognizing the implications of operational control in an international joint venture's' (IJV) sustenance and growth. Operational control is considered a significant factor in influencing an IJV's performance. The current research considers the three categories of operational control, i.e., dominant control, shared control, and split control, and then reviews the dynamics of these controls in the creation and progression of an IJV. The research takes up the literature review approach using TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics, Methods) technique to find out future avenues of research in context to operational control and IJV. Four distinct clusters have been carved out of the existing literature, namely, IJV's control structures and unpredictability, dark side of control and implications on IJV, control choice and IJV efficiency and lastly, trust, control, and IJV competence. This research discovered the role of trust in increasing partners' confidence in an IJV. The study also highlights the ownership structure and the influence of external environment in affecting the functioning of IJV. The article provides further details regarding the approaches by which executives can strategically position themselves to achieve the objectives of an IJV.

AB  - Healthy ecosystems benefit humans in various forms, and ecosystem services (ESs) are the benefits reaped by people in various forms. However, increase in global human population and the resulting anthropogenic activities have led to rapid alterations in the composition, structure, and functions of the ecosystems as well as their degradation, increasing the losses associated with ES values. Livelihoods of people in several developing countries are highly dependent on their surrounding ecosystems and the services they provide. Therefore, management and reduction of ecosystem modification are required; especially in developing countries, this requirement is even more urgent. In Africa, ecosystem-based studies are limited and in still in their initial stages. Hence, this paper examines dynamic Ethiopian ESs in Africa from 2010 to 2019 based on a systematic bibliometric analysis of articles from the Scopus database using a set of standard criteria. In total, 73 articles were published on Africa, including Ethiopia. The results reveal that the spatial distribution trend of ES studies is unevenly distributed, where most studies were conducted in the central highlands, followed by southwestern regions, with no studies on the western part of Ethiopia. Regarding service providing units (SPUs), the urban ecosystem and agroecosystem accounted for 25% and mixed ecosystems accounted for 20%. Furthermore, a total of 67 specific ESs were investigated by researchers, among which 81.25% of the specific ESs were classified into two ES categories. Provisioning ES (40.29%) dominated across all of the ES types while the cultural ES (5.97%) type has received little attention. Based on keywords, ESs were strongly linked to South Africa, Ethiopia, and biodiversity. In terms of the co-authorship network, authors from the United Kingdom, Italy, Burkina Faso, the Netherlands, and Germany actively collaborated with the Ethiopian researchers, and approximately 50% of the studies were aimed a estimating the value of the ESs through an applied mixed mode of ES study approaches. This review indicates that, due to land use land cover (LULC) changes from 1985 to 2015, approximately US$ 149.5 million or US$ 4.98 million annually in ES values were lost. Moreover, there is a critical need to extend ES studies to entire Ethiopia to capture the spatial and socioeconomic uniqueness of various ecosystems and focus more on multiple ES categories as a means to address ES synergies and provide unit-services to strengthen the relations among benefiting areas in Ethiopia.

AB  - PurposeIntermediate short food supply chains (SFSC) have been presented as a possible solution to unsustainable global food supply chains. There is currently a knowledge gap about intermediate SFSC. Thus, this review synthesizes the available literature to identify prominent themes and their main considerations.Design/methodology/approachThis research is based on a systematic literature review including peer-reviewed journal articles until December 2021. Inductive data coding resulted in the identification of four themes related to intermediate SFSC.FindingsThe identified themes illustrate the complex landscape intermediate SFSCs operate in and focus on the key relationships within these supply chains. The established relationships have implications for the governance of intermediate SFSCs. The organization of intermediate SFSCs affects numerous sustainability indicators.Research limitations/implicationsFuture research should focus on the position intermediate SFSCs have in food systems and the roles intermediaries have in intermediate SFSCs. There is furthermore an opportunity for researchers to investigate different types of intermediaries and explore the factors influencing them.Originality/valueCreating sustainable food supply chains is one of the major societal challenges of today. The current state of the art suggests that intermediate SFSCs could play an important role in achieving this. So far, this area is underdeveloped and this review highlights knowledge gaps in the literature and suggestions for a future research agenda are proposed.

AB  - The hospitality industry has undergone significant developments as new modes of environment-friendly tourism and hotels have emerged (including ecotourism, eco-hotels, ecolodges, and green hotels). These new features, however, have not been specifically investigated, especially in a considerably potential tourist destination like Iran. This study sought to develop a model for identifying and prioritizing the indicators that could determine the ecological features of hotels. Following a systematic review, exploratory factor analysis and analytic network process were used to construct a hybrid model and its elements were then prioritized in five-star hotels in the Fars province, Iran. The model consisted of five dimensions (totally including 19 indicators), namely "energy," "ecological adaptation," "materials and equipment," "foods and drinks," and "cultural-economic activities." The findings revealed that the "energy" dimension was significantly important, while indicators such as "effective use of water," "supply and efficient use of energy," and "use of renewable energies" were the most important indicators, respectively. The results of this study can encourage managers/practitioners in hotel accommodation to concentrate on the indicators that could promote the ecological level of hotels. In doing so, they can consider energy, foods, and beverage indicators in developing green hotels and implement appropriate accommodation with ecotourism standards to attract (inter)national tourists.

AB  - The large amount of research on corporate social responsibility in tourism shows its importance as a field of study. The role of tourism organizations and their impacts on sustainability have become increasingly important in recent decades. In addition, research on corporate social responsibility has expanded in scale and scope and can be found in a number of academic journals. The aim of this paper is to present the details of the academic work on corporate social responsibility in tourism and to demonstrate the intellectual structure of research in this field. This study analyzes 571 articles obtained from Scopus and published from 2002 to 2022 (August) and presents the development and growth of knowledge in corporate social responsibility and tourism. The study method used to extract the articles was based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The results indicate that this field of study has expanded significantly from being studied primarily in Europe towards being studied also in developing countries, such as China and India. In addition, the research themes emerging in the field of corporate social responsibility in tourism include tourism behaviors and strategic approaches to corporate social responsibility. This review highlights the emerging trends in research on corporate social responsibility in tourism, the dominant academic journals, and the countries that focus on research in this area. Furthermore, directions for future research are also presented.

AB  - Smallholder farmers are key contributors to food security globally, and more so in developing countries. Despite their critical role in food security, smallholder farmers are highly constrained by specific contextual challenges such as climate change, productivity, cost of production, credit access, and financial resources constraints that impact their sustenance, sustainability, and growth. Digital agriculture has emerged as a viable solution to addressing smallholder farmers' contextual challenges, with many digital solutions already existing and developed to serve the agriculture sector. However, many smallholder farmers are beyond the reach of these digital solutions due to underdeveloped or nonexistent digital ecosystems. This paper reports on a systematic review conducted to examine the research that has been undertaken regarding digital agriculture ecosystems in relation to smallholder farmers and to identify challenges, usage, benefits, access, and uptake of the systems. The key findings reveal very limited research directed at digital literacy or skills, affordability, and business model innovation. Most of the challenges concern digital infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy or skills. The findings also reveal that although digital agriculture is still a nascent concept to smallholder farmers, there are a few early adopters who access information mainly related to agriculture, selling, and marketing. There is, nonetheless, a lack of understanding of the value of digital agriculture systems. The study develops a research agenda that could facilitate digital transformation for smallholder farmers.

AB  - Purpose Continuous quality improvement (CQI) programmes have been taken up widely by indigenous primary health care services in Australia, but as yet there has not been a systematic assessment of their focus and achievements. A scoping review of the literature from studies of CQI in indigenous primary health care services was undertaken to explore impacts on service systems, care and client outcomes with the aim of providing guidance on future evaluation efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues,
   Design/methodology/approach Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to December 2016 and handsearching of key websites and publications. Studies of CQI programs or activities in Indigenous primary health care services which demonstrated some combination of CQI characteristics, as described by Rubenstein (2013) were included. A two-stage approach to analysis was undertaken. Stage 1 identified the range and scope of literature, and Stage 2 investigated impacts to service systems, care and client outcomes. The Framework for Performance Assessment in Primary Health Care was used to frame the Stage 2 analysis.
   Findings The majority of Aboriginal community controlled health services have been involved in CQI but there are gaps in knowledge about uptake in general practice and government clinics. There are as many baseline studies as studies on impacts over time. Of the 14 studies included for further analysis, 6 reported on impacts on service systems; all 14 reported on impacts on care and 6 on client outcomes. Changes to services systems are variable and studies of impacts on care and client outcomes show promising though uneven improvements. There are no economic studies or studies addressing community engagement in CQI activities.
   Research limitations/implications To supplement existing limited knowledge about which service system change strategies are effective and sustainable for which problems in which settings, there needs to be investment in research and development. Research needs to be grounded in the realities of service delivery and contribute to the development of CQI capacity at the service level. Knowledge translation needs to be built into implementation to ensure maximum benefit to those endeavouring on a daily basis to constantly reflect on and improve the quality of the care they deliver to clients, and to the stewardship structures supporting services at regional, state/territory and national levels.
   Practical implications Improved approaches, methods, data capture and reporting arrangements are needed to enhance existing activity and to ensure maximum benefit to services endeavouring to reflect on and improve quality of care and to the stewardship structure supporting services at regional, state/territory and national levels.
   Originality/value Although there is a growing body of research evidence about CQI both nationally and internationally, and considerable investment by the federal government in Australia to support CQI as part of routine practice, there has not been a systematic assessment of the achievements of CQI in Indigenous primary health care services. Many unanswered questions remain about the extent of uptake, implementation and impacts. This is a barrier to future investment and regional and local programme design, monitoring and evaluation. The authors conducted a scoping review to address these questions. From this, the authors draw conclusions about the state of knowledge in Australia with a view to informing how future CQI research and evaluation might be intensified.

AB  - Building sector is responsible for approximately 40% of global carbon dioxide emission. Accordingly, any measures for reducing building energy consumption or providing it with renewable sources would substantially benefit sustainable development. A major approach towards this goal could be the application of photovoltaic modules in buildings, which could be conducted in various configurations. Integrating phase change materials with photovoltaic panels could simultaneously provide thermal regulation for the panel as well as thermal energy storage for the building. During the last two decades, research efforts on photovoltaic-phase change material systems for building applications have considerably grown. A systematic review of the current state of knowledge on photovoltaic-PCM modules applied in buildings could greatly benefit future research in this area. With this purpose in mind, the present study reviews the building applications of photovoltaic-phase change material units. The study aims to classify the existing literature on the field for acquiring a better understanding of the technological progress as well as identifying the existing gaps and future research prospects. Research attempts are categorized in four experimental, numerical, optimization, and economic sections. Each category is thoroughly analyzed and discussed in terms of current state of knowledge. Finally, technical analysis and possible future subjects are introduced and discussed.

AB  - Co-produced practices and publications in the healthcare sector are gaining momentum, since they can be a useful tool in addressing the sustainability and resilience challenges of health systems. However, the investigation of positive and, mainly, negative outcomes is still confused and fragmented, and above all, a comprehensive knowledge of the metrics used to assess these outcomes is lacking. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically review the extant literature to map the methods, tools and metrics used to empirically evaluate co-production in health services. The search took place in six databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Psych INFO, PubMed, Cochrane and CINAHL. A total of 2311 articles were screened and 203 articles were included in the analysis, according to PRISMA guidelines. Findings show that outcomes are mainly investigated through qualitative methods and from the lay actor or provider perspective. Moreover, the detailed categorisation of the quantitative measures found offers a multidimensional performance measurement system and highlights the impact areas where research is needed to develop and test new measures. Findings should also promote improvements in empirical data collection on the multiple faceted co-produced activities and spur the consciousness of the adoption of sustainable co-productive initiatives.

AB  - The interior environment as the place where people spend nearly 95% of their time in, has recently received considerable attention within the domain of the built environment. The concept of Sustainable Interior Architecture and Design (SIAD) and its significance have been recognized given its potential for energy conservation, and its impacts on occupants' satisfaction, comfort, as well as their physical and psychological wellbeing. Although the adoption of SIAD is crucial in achieving the sustainable development goals, its practice is still hindered by numerous deterrents. A number of studies have reported on these deterrents; however, there is no comprehensive review of the literature on this topic. Thus, as a first step toward addressing the present gap, this article provides a two decade (2000-2021) systematic review of the relevant literature that investigates a total of 51 publications. Furthermore, a scientometric analysis was conducted, and the co-citation and co-occurrence of journals and keywords were analyzed to illustrate the scientific landscape. A comprehensive summary table is provided consisting of 61 deterrents to the practice of SIAD that are categorized into five main categories: (1) economic; (2) attitude, knowledge, and awareness; (3) market, information, and technology; (4) education and training; as well as (5) government and professional bodies. Finally, the findings are deliberated upon and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and the disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the synergism between urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Koppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural land use is transforming rapidly in Southeast Asia, often supported by development policies aiming primarily at economic growth. However, the socioeconomic outcomes of these changes for smallholder farmers remain unclear. Here, we systematically review cases of agricultural land use change in Southeast Asia to assess their socioeconomic outcomes and potential trade-off and synergies in these outcomes. Of the 126 reviewed cases, we find mostly positive outcomes for income (SDG 1, 100 cases) and employment (SDG 8, 11 cases), while outcomes on health (SDG 3, 9 cases) were mixed, and outcomes for food security (SDG 2, 44 cases), gender equality (SDG 5, 13 cases), and economic equality (SDG 10, 14 cases) were mostly negative. Studies describing multiple outcomes show indications of synergies between income and food security, and between income and employment, but also potential trade-offs between income and economic equality. In addition, we find that economic land concessions result in multiple negative outcomes more often than other types of land governance regimes. The results provide evidence that economic gains from agricultural land use change often come at a cost of other dimensions of sustainable development.

AB  - Sport fishing has ecological, economic, and social importance, but there are few studies that characterize it according to the sustainability tripod. Due to this gap, we present a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the current situation of sport fishing in Brazil. The papers on the subject were systematically evaluated based on quantitative criteria. Additionally, in order to create a list of the species of interest of sport fishers, the survey of 22 papers was carried out regarding the species caught. A total of 70 complete papers published between 1994 and 2021 were included in the study. Since the 1990s, publications have increased quantitatively, with most studies coming from the South-Eastern region of Brazil (39.19%). The papers published discussed, in the majority, the sport fishing carried out in marine environment (55.38%), and the focus was "fishing and fishers" (30%). Evaluating the sustainability tripod, most of the papers provided only information regarding the ecological aspect (58.57%). About 330 species of marine and freshwater fish of interest to sport fishers were dealt with in the studies. This information reflects the current state of knowledge about Brazilian sport fishing, and it can serve as a basis for the management of the activity and the target species used by fishers. Additionally, the present review can serve as an aid for future research on this topic.

AB  - This article aims to review and systematize prior works that investigate how the presence of women in top echelon positions of firms affects sustainability and to create an agenda to guide future research in this promising area. In contrast to previous reviews, ours examines how women in top echelon positions affect sustainability by distinguishing both the position women held in the firm (i.e. Board of Directors-BoD, top management team, CEO and relevant committees) and the specific elements of sustainability (i.e. activity, performance, and disclosure). Our structured systematic review resulted in 187 publications retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus and revealed that the presence of women in top echelon positions is associated with greater engagement in social and environmental projects. Their presence also positively influences the environmental and social performance and increases the level, quality, and transparency of sustainability disclosure. Furthermore, the presence of women in top echelon positions and the implementation of sustainable activities improve both the firm financial performance and value. However, conflicting results have also emerged. On the basis of these findings, research gaps and future research agenda are identified and presented.

AB  - Humanity will always be indebted to plants. In the ongoing scientific era, the 'Herbal Revolution' has helped discover several valuable medicinal plants and associated novel secondary metabolites from the diverse unexplored ecosystems, treating several diseases via phytotherapy. The Aconitum genus comprises several economically-important poisonous mountainous medicinal plant species whose unique biodiversity is on the verge of extinction due to illegal human intervention triggered habitat loss, over-harvesting, and unrestricted trading. Owing to its vast diversity of diterpene alkaloids, most species are extensively used to treat several ailments in rural parts of the world. Irrespective of this, many unexplored and intriguing prospects exist to understand and utilize this critical plant for human benefit. This systematic review tries to fill this gap by compiling information from the sporadically available literature known for similar to 300 Aconitum spp. regarding its nomenclature and classification, endangerment, plant morphology, ploidy, secondary metabolites, drug pharmacokinetics, conservation, and omics-based computational studies. We also depicted the disparity in the studied model organisms for this diverse genus. The absence of genomic/metagenomic data is becoming a limiting factor in understanding its plant physiology, metabolic pathways, and plant-microbes interactions, and therefore must be promoted. Additionally, government support and public participation are crucial in establishing conservation protocols to save this plant from endangerment.

AB  - General practitioners (GPs) are increasingly expected to provide palliative care as ageing populations put pressure on specialist services. Some GPs, however, cite barriers to providing this care including prognostication challenges and lack of confidence. Palliative care content within clinical practice guidelines might serve as an opportunistic source of informational support to GPs. This review analysed palliative care content within Australian guidelines for life-limiting conditions to determine the extent to which it might satisfy GPs' stated information needs and support them to provide quality end-of-life care. Six databases and guideline repositories were searched (2011-2018). Eligible guidelines were those for a GP audience and explicitly based on an appraisal of all available evidence. Content was mapped against an established palliative care domain framework (PEPSI-COLA) and quality was assessed using AGREE-II. The nine guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were heterogenous in scope and depth of palliative care domain coverage. The 'communication' needs domain was best addressed while patient physical and emotional needs were variably covered. Spiritual, out-of-hours, terminal care and aftercare content was scant. Few guidelines addressed areas GPs are known to find challenging or acknowledged useful decision-support tools. A template covering important domains might reduce content variability across guidelines.

AB  - The uncertain fate and transport pathways of applied pesticides are the key hidden threats with respect to the safety and quality evaluation of foodstuffs in Bangladesh. The risk assessment of and uncertainty about applied pesticides are poorly explored due to weak regulatory systems, farmer ignorance, intensive agricultural practices, and lack of available research data on improper handling of pesticides on farming lands with poor phytosanitary management. However, increasing evidence suggests that the prevalence of pesticides in common foodstuffs is due to their uptake by crops and improper management of crop protection practices. Besides, the biotransformation of pesticides in common Bangladeshi food products is poorly understood. Several studies have reported higher concentrations of pesticides than allowed by European Union guidelines in Bangladeshi foodstuffs. However, to date, no systematic review with critical discussion on current research findings and knowledge gaps concerning fate, uncertainty, and health risks of pesticides in the foodstuffs of Bangladesh is published. Therefore, this review summarizes the findings of existing literature on pesticide residue in foodstuffs and points out the weaknesses in the regulatory system and risk assessments for highlighting the critical challenges to food safety in Bangladesh as compared to global food policy. In addition, strategies for the sustainable management of residual pesticides are also discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, the research community focuses on sustainability studies that are at the severe phase in the transformation towards a sustainable world. In addition, reducing the human impact on the environment requires a shift from traditional energy to renewables, which have increased significantly during recent decades as sustainable energy sources. Hence, this study assesses renewable energy sources and their related production phases from a supply chain management perception, screening and reviewing the integration between the supply chain management within the area of energy production focusing on renewable energy resources. The study executes a systematic review of English literature published on international scientific databases, focusing on the previous decade 2010-2020, to congregate the recently updated knowledge related to such research area. Thus, this study provides an authentic review of the literature that points to the relationship between supply chain operations and the area of renewable energy manufacturing from another side. Several literature reviews have been available concentrating on particular areas of managing renewable energy supply chains; however, no review has highlighted the practices of supply chain processes in energy production, focusing on renewables. The searching process relies on the published works that focus on such an area to be analyzed and characterized based on different methodologies they propose; thus, prospective and future research interests are delineated.

AB  - It gives me great pleasure to announce the sixth regular issue of 2022. First of all, I would like to welcome all the new members of our editorial board and also express my sincere gratitude to all the members who have recently retired. It is only thanks to the expertise of our editorial board and volunteer guest reviewers, as well as the generous support of the J.UCS consortium and the novel contributions of our authors, that we are able to maintain this high standard and even improve the impact factor over the years. In this issue, various topical aspects of computer science are covered by 12 authors Larra??aga and Ana Arruarte from Italy present a systematic review of the literature on the use of augmented reality applications in primary and secondary schools, with a specific focus on collaborative, multi-user, and interactive applications. In their article, describe an approach to add a new data structure, binary decision diagrams (BDD), to the TRIAS algorithm and retrieve triadic concepts for high dimensional contexts. In a collaborative research between Croatia and Ukraine, Igor Tomicic, Markus Schatten, and Vadym Shkarupylo propose an open ontology for self-sustainable human settlements in an effort to find a common language for modeling self-sustainable systems and address issues of heterogeneity of physical devices, protocols, software components, data and message formats, and other relevant factors for the implementation of smart systems. Last but not least, Derya Yiltas-Kaplan from Turkey presents her research on traffic optimization with software-defined network controllers.

AB  - Due to the rapid development of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things, the volume of generated data keeps growing. The topic of data quality has gained increasing attention recently. Numerous studies have explored various data quality (DQ) problems across several fields, with corresponding effective data-cleaning strategies being researched. This paper begins with a comprehensive and systematic review of studies related to DQ. On the one hand, we classify these DQ-related studies into six types: redundant data, missing data, noisy data, erroneous data, conflicting data, and sparse data. On the other hand, we discuss the corresponding data-cleaning strategies for each DQ type. Secondly, we examine DQ issues and potential solutions for a public bus transportation system, utilizing a real-world traffic big data platform. Finally, we provide two representative examples, noise filtering and filling missing values, to demonstrate the DQ improvement practice. The experimental results show that: (1) The GPS noise filtering solution we proposed surpasses the baseline and achieves an accuracy of 97%; (2) The multi-source data fusion method can achieve a 100% missing repair rate (MRR) for bus arrival and departure. The average relative error (ARE) of bus arrival and departure times at stations is less than 1%, and the correlation coefficient (R) is also close to 1. Our research can offer guidance and lessons for enhancing data governance and quality improvement in the bus transportation system.

AB  - Background: Children represent a significant percentage of casualties in modern conflict. Yet, the epidemiology of conflict-related injury among children is poorly understood. A comprehensive analysis of injuries sustained by children in 21st-century armed conflict is necessary to inform planning of local, military, and humanitarian health responses.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, World Health Organization Catalog, and Google Scholar to identify records that described conflict-related injuries sustained by children since 2001.
   Results: The search returned 5,264 records. 9 eligible reports without potentially duplicative data were included in analysis, representing 5,100 pediatric patients injured in 5 conflicts. Blast injury was the most frequent mechanism (57%), compared to 24.8% in adults. Mortality was only slightly higher among children (11.0% compared to 9.8% among adults; p <0.05). Non-uniform reporting prevented pooled analysis and limited the conclusions that could be drawn.
   Conclusions: Children sustain a higher proportion of blast injury than adults in conflict. Existing data do support the conclusion that child casualties have higher mortality than adults overall; however, this difference is slighter than has been previously reported. Specific subpopulations of children appear to have worse outcomes. Overall, non-uniform reporting renders currently available data insufficient to understand the needs of children injured in modern conflict. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change probably has severe impacts on animal populations, but demonstrating a causal link can be difficult because of potential influences by additional factors. Assessing global impacts of climate change effects may also be hampered by narrow taxonomic and geographical research foci. We review studies on the effects of climate change on populations of amphibians and reptiles to assess climate change effects and potential biases associated with the body of work that has been conducted within the last decade. We use data from 104 studies regarding the effect of climate on 313 species, from 464 species-study combinations. Climate change effects were reported in 65% of studies. Climate change was identified as causing population declines or range restrictions in half of the cases. The probability of identifying an effect of climate change varied among regions, taxa and research methods. Climatic effects were equally prevalent in studies exclusively investigating climate factors (more than 50% of studies) and in studies including additional factors, thus bolstering confidence in the results of studies exclusively examining effects of climate change. Our analyses reveal biases with respect to geography, taxonomy and research question, making global conclusions impossible. Additional research should focus on under-represented regions, taxa and questions. Conservation and climate policy should consider the documented harm climate change causes reptiles and amphibians.

AB  - Smart building technology has received a broad audience due to digitalisation and benefits in the construction industry. With global interest, the construction of smart buildings has become a new trend in development. Many studies identified a significant interest in the smart building technology application more than in conventional buildings. However, in developing countries, construction professionals have paid little attention to the adoption of smart building technology. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the benefits that are attached to the adoption of smart building technology (SBT) in the construction industry. The study is based on a systematic review of published articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. A total of 55 papers comprising conferences and journal articles retrieved from Scopus database were utilised for the study. The study's findings revealed efficient energy consumption, cost-effective building maintenance and operation, job creation, health care management, real-time monitoring, safety and security, among others, as benefits of smart building technologies (SBTs). For smart building technology to thrive in emerging economies, a comprehensive understanding of its benefits is highly imperative. This will not only promote construction professionals' knowledge of its concept but also enhance its successful adoption in these regions. Thus, the paper provides some insights into the benefit of smart building technology in developing countries while suggesting the formation of a synergic structure between the research community and practitioners in the construction sector.

AB  - BackgroundThere are many controversies related to bariatric surgery. This review explores selected areas.
   MethodsA combination of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and expert opinion have been brought together to highlight areas of importance or conflict.
   Results and ConclusionMetabolic surgery is an increasingly preferred term rather than bariatric or obesity surgery. Reporting should be standardized to include appropriate weight measures, valid disease measures and data on loss to follow-up. There are many putative mechanisms of effect of key bariatric procedures, but satiety and early satiation appear central. Weight loss must be durable. Long-term outcome studies (more than 10-year follow-up) show that biliopancreatic diversion is most effective, with 72 per cent excess weight loss (EWL). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) are equally effective, with 54 per cent EWL. There are no long-term data on vertical sleeve gastrectomy. Type II diabetes is a common and serious disease, usually associated with increased weight. Multiple RCTs have shown that bariatric surgery provides clear benefits over continuing with non-surgical therapies. The earlier the treatment, the more likely and durable will be the remission. Bariatric surgery should be available to all who are obese (body mass index over 30kg/m(2)). LAGB, a safe, effective, reversible outpatient procedure, is the author's preferred primary option.

AB  - The oil refining industry, which was established in the mid-19th century, has become a foundation of modern society. While the refining of crude oil to produce transportation fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and a variety of other products has brought manifold benefits, it has also led to the global proliferation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as local air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels. The industry is therefore confronted with a growing need to decarbonize its operations, as well as to support decarbonization of the end use sectors that it directly enables. This paper provides a systematic and critical literature review to uncover the means by which the oil refining industry can decarbonize and evolve as part of an increasingly carbon constrained future. A sociotechnical perspective is used to understand the full range of industrial and economic activities where a decarbonized oil refining industry is expected to remain important and to provide the framework to assess key technical, economic, social and political factors that will likely impact the evolution of the oil refining industry. We highlight key opportunities for this industry to decarbonize while also exposing gaps in the existing literature concerning its decarbonization. The insights provided are expected to support policy makers, researchers and practitioners with the tools needed advance a low-carbon transition of the oil refining industry.

AB  - Energy-saving and efficiency represent a crucial role in achieving a clean environment as well as economic and social development, providing substantial benefits to stakeholders, including householders. Better cost savings can be achieved by simply changing behavior. However, real energy users lack proper technical energy knowledge, awareness, and education in most cases. In most countries, women are involved in a higher percentage of energy activities in household chores but have less gender participation in energy decisions. In this regard, a gender perspective effectively understands energy users' pragmatic and strategic needs for energy-saving behavior improvement. Previous literature reviews have been focusing on specific aspects of energy sustainability; however, no review has focused on energy-saving from a gender perspective to the best of our knowledge. It aims to provide a systematic review of literature on energy-saving and management, highlighting the importance of gender roles and fulfilling the literature's study gaps that provide future possible research streams. The review finds that females use lower energy than males in household activities that has supported in household energy-saving behavior. In addition, gender, income, family composition, ownership, and education are significant influencing factors in energy-saving behavior, and gender differences are rooted in socialization, responsibility, and choice of energy appliances that have impacted energy decisions influencing energy-saving behavior and sustainability goals.

AB  - Air transportation systems are an important part of the critical infrastructure in our connected world. Accordingly, a better understanding and improvements in the resilience of the overall air transportation system are essential to the well-functioning of our society and overall sustainability of human beings. In the literature, network science is increasingly used to better understand the resilience dynamics of air transportation. Given the wide application of tools for network science and the importance of designing resilient air transportation systems, a rich body of studies has emerged in recent years. This review paper synthesizes the related literature that has been published throughout the last 15 years regarding the robustness of air transportation systems. The contributions of this work consist of two major elements. The first part provides a comprehensive discussion and cross-comparison of the reported results. We cover several major topics, including node importance identification, failure versus attack profiles, recovery and improvement techniques, and networks of networks approaches. The second part of this paper complements the review of aggregated findings by elaborating on a future agenda for robust air transportation research. Our survey-style overview hopefully contributes toward a better understanding of the state of the art in this research area, and, in turn, to the improvement of future air transportation resilience and sustainability.

AB  - Despite the official end of colonialism in the twentieth century, neocolonial structures of power have kept influencing the political, socio-cultural and economic arenas worldwide. Within this scenario, the tourism academy has seen its landscape develop with its own set of power structures, which have shaped its knowledge production and dissemination. However, whether and how neocolonial forces have exerted their influence on tourism knowledge production and dissemination is still a subject of debate among scholars. This paper was conceived as an attempt to cast additional light on the nexus between tourism knowledge and neocolonialism. More specifically, through a systematic review of the articles published in tourism journals in the last decade (2007-2017), this work assesses the status of the current tourism knowledge through the lens of neocolonialist theory. Overall, this critical review highlights that with some exceptions, most of the previous reviews concerning tourism knowledge only evaluate the work published in English in highly ranked tourism journals and tend to neglect knowledge systems outside the English-speaking global centres. Furthermore, previous studies exploring structures of power affecting tourism knowledge production and dissemination present limitations in terms of the themes and perspectives identified.

AB  - The quality and extent of the 'matrix' in terrestrial fragmented landscapes may influence the persistence and behaviour of patch-associated fauna. Butterflies are a popular target group for fragmentation studies and represent an ideal assemblage to explore the impact and role of the matrix in patchy landscapes. To date, there has been no attempt to synthesise available research and assess the extent to which the matrix is included in studies of fragmented butterfly populations. Addressing this issue is important for improved understanding of habitat use in fragmented landscapes, and for the successful management and conservation of butterfly biodiversity. Our systematic review of 100 empirical research papers spans 50 years, and identifies how (and indeed if) the matrix is recognised in studies of butterfly populations in fragmented landscapes. We found that it was significantly more likely for studies not to include the matrix in their experimental design. This is of particular concern given 60 % of papers that excluded the matrix in their research did so in systems where the matrix was expected to contain resources of value for patch-associated species (as it was either a heterogeneous landscape or had similar structure to patches). Of the papers that did consider the matrix, 80 % (n = 24) reported a negative effect of the matrix on butterfly species and/or communities. Matrix effects may influence the survival and persistence of faunal groups in a world increasingly dominated by fragmented habitats. Our review suggests that future research should clearly define the matrix, and incorporate it in appropriate experimental designs.

AB  - Sustainability issues are becoming increasingly important in the hospitality sector during crisis times such as COVID-19 and post-pandemic. In order to synthesize the literature on sustainable practices in hospitality, we developed a systematic literature to illustrate the dominant sustainable practices in hospitality. We present a comprehensive review of the 48 articles on sustainable practices in hospitality through the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases; spanning over 2 years (2020-2021) pre-and amid the COVID-19 pandemic and extending the scope in distinctive ways. Our review has demonstrated that sustainable practices in hospitality have made progress in the years 2020 and 2021. However, there are conceptual and empirical overlaps among sustainable practices in hospitality. Additionally, hospitality sustainable practices research is restricted in research contexts. There is a lack of research on antecedents, outcomes, and integrating theories in studies. By following the guidance presented in this review, we expect to advance and maintain sustainable practices research to provide substantive insights over the coming years post-COVID-19. The current research is one of the first studies to systematically review sustainable practices in hospitality pre-and amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The research ends with a comprehensive research agenda and a framework to apprise future theoretical and empirical advances in the area.

AB  - Biological invasions pose significant challenges in the Anthropocene, impacting ecosystem biodiversity and functioning. Ecological Niche Modeling is widely used to evaluate potential areas at risk of invasions, aiding in the prevention of invasive-species expansion and guiding conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. The main objectives of this study were to model the ecological niche and evaluate remaining suitable habitat areas for the occurrence of five potentially invasive species of freshwater decapods in South America: Dilocarcinus pagei, Macrobrachium amazonicum, M. jelskii, M. rosenbergii, and Procambarus clarkii. Occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility were complemented with a literature systematic review. Variables used in the models were obtained from the Worldclim and EarthEv databases. Ecological Niche Modeling was performed using the Biomod2 and sdm package algorithms. Our results indicated a suitable area of up to 11% of South America. Model evaluations yielded favorable TSS and AUC values (>0.7 and >0.8). The suitable areas projected for South America included several hydrographic basins and Protected Areas. The information generated in our study can help identifying areas susceptible to decapod invasion in South America and support local management and decisions.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) have gained traction in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region over the last decade. While the benefits of NbS are established for most urban contexts, more research is necessary to examine the potential of these solutions in the Global South, particularly in historically disadvantaged contexts such as informal settlements. Responding to this gap, we analyse both grey and academic sources to examine past NbS projects in informal settlements in Southeast Asian and Pacific countries. We identified six main types of NbS that are used to address various social, ecological, and cultural challenges in informal settlements. Some NbS are different from those described in the Global North, ranging from the use of traditional community gardens to enhance food security to the implementation of constructed wetlands as wastewater treatment systems. NbS in the region are often framed as grassroots initiatives spearheaded by local communities or as technical systems implemented within "upgrading programs" delivered by multilateral banks, researchers or international orga-nisations. Analysing the motivations behind these projects, we provide insights into which systems have been used in response to specific needs such as efforts to promote climate adaptation, support food security or compensate residents for disruptions. We outline important social and political implications of the imple-mentation of NbS still understudied in the literature, such as the framing of NbS as "placeholders" for future development or as "compensation" for the disruptions caused by resettlement projects.

AB  - Over one hundred governments are currently negotiating a new legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). The new agreement is to address four broad themes: marine genetic resources (MGRs); area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs); environmental impact assessments (EIAs); and capacity building and the transfer of marine technology (CB&TT). Although a large corpus of scientific BBNJ literature exists, a comprehensive overview and critical analysis of the academic debate is currently missing. This systematic review seeks to fill this gap by examining the main priority topics and recommendations in a sample of 140 multidisciplinary, geographically diverse publications. As an up-to-date summary and analysis, it is intended for researchers from diverse academic disciplines in the natural and social sciences, policy-makers, and practitioners. It untangles the complex BBNJ negotiations, highlights the policy relevance of existing work, and facilitates links between science, policy, and practice. It presents recommendations made in the literature sample for each of the four package elements of the future treaty and identifies four overarching themes: ocean connectivity, institutional design, the role of science, and digital technology. This paper identifies two important gaps that need to be addressed if we are to conserve marine biodiversity in international waters: the science-policy interfaces and the need for transformative change.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to structure research on water resources in the hotel industry, identifying the key areas and research gaps in this field.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review of water use in the hotel industry has been performed using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. From 515 articles selected between the years 2000 and 2019, a sample of 58 articles was used to structure existing research on this subject.
   Findings - Research is classified into four groups: water consumption, water management, impacts of water use and good practices, with different research methods and topics within each one. Existing research gaps and their causes are also discussed. The results show how academic research can help strengthen international methodologies that measure sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the search process, some publications on water consumption in the hotel industry may have been missed; also book chapters and conference papers were excluded. Furthermore, the authors recognise some subjectivity in the classification of articles.
   Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis focussed on water use in the hotel industry. The findings can be used to build a research framework for this area, establishing an approach to cover research gaps and to connect academic research with general methodologies and indicators of sustainability, as well as improving data collection techniques in this field.

AB  - Sustainable production of fish and seafood products contributes to achieving the economic, social, and environmental goals in fisheries. Different sustainability strategies are applied to achieve these three goals. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the status and implementation of various sustainable fishery management strategies in the Philippines over the past 20 years. We identified various management themes and the extent these themes are related to economic, social and environmental sustainability goals using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and text mining. Six sustainability management themes were identified. The analysis shows that overall, the sustainability management themes appear to be socio-economic in nature based on the relative occurrences of indicators belonging to the three sustainability goals. When comparing the strength of the three sustainability goals in each management theme, the social goal appears to be most prominent in four management themes, the economic goal in one theme, and a balance of the three sustainability goals in another theme. Furthermore, this study shows which fishery management themes are most (dis-)similar based on clustering. Policy makers and other fishery management bodies can use these insights to optimize the sustainability goals in fisheries by not only relying on a single management theme in each fishery, by improving focus on large scale fishers, by incorporating underexplored sustainability indicators, and by adapting current trends and proven-to-be effective management themes.

AB  - The objective of this work is to identify the relationship between the behavior of IT professionals and the resistance of users to the use of a new information system. For the elaboration of the data collection instrument, a systematic review of the literature was developed in order to list the reactions already studied and propose a new model. As for the method, the survey was used as a research strategy, applying an online questionnaire as a data collection instrument. The questionnaire obtained 151 valid responses. For data analysis, paraconsistent logic techniques and data mining algorithms (association rules and data grouping) were applied. The results show that, regarding the perception of user resistance, IT professionals believe that the change in workflow is the main reason for resistance to new systems. As for the reaction of IT professionals, the data allowed us to verify that most respondents try to take actions related to dissuasion, in its support persuasion subcategory, and also actions related to rectification, in its two subcategories: congruent and non-congruent. This research brought a different look to the phenomenon of user resistance: the perception of IT professionals. This contributes to the development of research in the area of user resistance, especially by bringing the categorization of professionals' reactions found in the literature, aggregating them and explaining them conceptually, providing a basis for both new research and the adoption of new ones. measures in organizations.

AB  - Over the past few decades, city centres and their retail spaces have undergone significant changes and have struggled to remain economically viable. The COVID-19 pandemic and the public health response to the crisis have exacerbated this situation and posed a serious challenge to the already economically struggling city centres. Recommendations for how city centres should respond to the current crisis are urgently needed, but despite this, few studies have focused on the impact of COVID-19 on retailing in city centres. This paper conducts a systematic review to provide a better understanding of how retail in city centres has been affected by the pandemic. It also offers insights to support better decision making about the future of retailing in city centres and provides recommendations for ensuring a sustainable future for city centres. The review, conducted between the 20th of November 2021 and the 20th of January 2022, shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health response have intensified some considerable changes in customer preferences and the role of city centres. As a result of these changes, more retailers have adopted multichannel retailing and repositioning strategies. This paper concludes that in order to create vibrant and sustainable city centres post-pandemic, decision makers should support the repurposing of vacant and underperforming retail spaces, promote an experience economy, and create episodic retail spaces.

AB  - Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB  - Continuous missions to Low-Earth Orbit, Moon and even Mars missions are the prospect for the coming decades of especially human spaceflight. The actors in these missions are commercial and institutional, public and pri -vate. The bandwidth of planned missions is wide, ranging from scientific exploration to commercial exploitation. In-situ resource utilization is planned to support such missions and thus reduce the amount of effort needed for transportation of goods to mission regions, e.g. by supplying water or fuel on the lunar or Martian surface. In the past decades the concept of sustainable development and sustainability has been evolved and became more and more relevant for many aspects of human life and society. These terms have also migrated into more specialized fields such as spaceflight. This paper systematically reviews the concepts of sustainable development and sus-tainability which have been formulated in a spaceflight context implicitly and explicitly. For this purpose, four perspectives are defined which originate from either Earth or space and alternate with the addressed object between Earth and space as well. It is explained and discussed how these concepts manifest in a spaceflight context, how they evolved over time and which implications result from the respective point of view. Subse-quently, the formulation of space in-situ sustainable development is coined and an outlook is given how to further evolve this centric idea to enable a comprehensive evaluation of mission scenarios and roadmaps with regard to their sustainability.

AB  - Tanker water markets (TWM) supply water services in many urban areas, including those unconnected to public infrastructures. Notwithstanding, they have been associated with outcomes in conflict with sustainability goals of water policy, e.g., through inequitable and unaffordable supply or by contributing to groundwater overexploitation. So far, the literature dedicated to TWM has primarily conducted case studies embedded in diverse local contexts, which impedes the comparison and transfer of insights. In this article, we systematically summarize existing empirical knowledge on TWM and assess to what extent normative claims about the impacts of TWM on sustainability goals are supported by evidence. We use the concept of sustainable access, which combines notions of what constitutes access to water and what characterizes sustainable supply of services. The available evidence suggests that TWM have two key functions in urban water systems: (1) They provide services at otherwise unavailable levels, particularly with respect to the temporal availability and spatial accessibility of the service, and (2) they extend access to areas without or with low-quality network supply, typically low-income communities on the fringe of cities. From the perspective of sustainable access, we find that TWM can provide high service levels and thus fill a specific gap in the landscape of urban water services. Due to comparatively high prices, however, it is unlikely that these services are affordable for all. The combination of heterogeneous access to cheaper (subsidized) piped water and marginal pricing in TWM results in allocation outcomes that are not coherent with existing notions of equitable access to water. However, there is little convincing evidence that TWM necessarily result in unsustainable water use. The literature indicates that urban water governance in the studied areas is frequently characterized by a lack of effective institutions, which impedes the regulation or formalization of TWM.

AB  - Archetypes are increasingly used as a methodological approach to understand recurrent patterns in variables and processes that shape the sustainability of social-ecological systems. The rapid growth and diversification of archetype analyses has generated variations, inconsistencies, and confusion about the meanings, potential, and limitations of archetypes. Based on a systematic review, a survey, and a workshop series, we provide a consolidated perspective on the core features and diverse meanings of archetype analysis in sustainability research, the motivations behind it, and its policy relevance. We identify three core features of archetype analysis: recurrent patterns, multiple models, and intermediate abstraction. Two gradients help to apprehend the variety of meanings of archetype analysis that sustainability researchers have developed: (1) understanding archetypes as building blocks or as case typologies and (2) using archetypes for pattern recognition, diagnosis, or scenario development. We demonstrate how archetype analysis has been used to synthesize results from case studies, bridge the gap between global narratives and local realities, foster methodological interplay, and transfer knowledge about sustainability strategies across cases. We also critically examine the potential and limitations of archetype analysis in supporting evidence-based policy making through context-sensitive generalizations with case-level empirical validity. Finally, we identify future priorities, with a view to leveraging the full potential of archetype analysis for supporting sustainable development.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The trade in marine ornamental fishes appears to have commenced around the 1930s, and the number and diversity of species traded remain unclear. Figures currently available are based on estimates or are inferred using limited information from various formal and trade organisations. Almost all marine ornamental fishes are wild-caught from coral reefs, and mortality rates throughout the supply chain can be high. The consequences of removing these fishes from their ecosystems are poorly understood. This article collates and examines available information including scientific studies and publications from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation, as well as from other formal and trade organisations, in order to create a more accurate picture of the extent of commercial activities. We demonstrate that it is an almost impossible task to analyse the trade in marine ornamental fishes due to a lack of data on commerce, as well as the fact that available data for marine species is frequently combined with that for freshwater species. This review highlights the urgent need for a global monitoring system to gather accurate and timely information on the number and species of ornamental fishes in commerce, where specimens originated, and whether they were wild-caught or captive-bred.
   The multi-billion dollar trade in ornamental fishes has rarely been reliably monitored. Almost all coral reef fishes are wild-caught, and few scientific analyses have attempted to elicit exact quantities and identify species involved. The consequences of the removal of millions of these fishes are poorly understood. This article collates and examines available information, including scientific studies and formal publications, in order to create a more accurate picture of this commerce. We demonstrate that it is almost impossible to analyse the trade in marine ornamental fishes due to a lack of data, and that available data for marine species is frequently combined with that for freshwater species. Figures range from 15 to 30 million coral reef fishes being traded annually, but could be as high as 150 million specimens. The global value of this trade was only estimated for 1976 and 1999 between USD 28-40 million. This review highlights the urgent need to introduce a specific harmonised system tariff code and for a global monitoring system, such as the Trade Control and Expert System already in use in Europe, in order to gather accurate and timely information on the number and species of marine ornamental fishes in commerce, where specimens originated, and whether they were wild-caught or captive-bred.

AB  - With affordable and clean energy being one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG7), most developing economies are still caught up with the dilemma of inadequate power supply and heavy dependence on fossil fuel. This social menace is premised on rapid population growth, industrialization, modernization, etc. Even though these sources of power appear to be far-fetched from being sufficient, they are noted for creating a significant level of environmental pollution, global warming, and health-related risks. The Conference of Parties 26 (COP26) assembly held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, stressed the need to bring down the rising annual global temperatures to 1.5 degrees, with developing economies having a significant role in achieving this target. This article has presented a review with insight into certain power generation metrics within the context of (SDG7). This span across the investigation of different energy modelling tools, their depth of effectiveness, the general pros and cons of energy policies premised on these tools, and progress made so far towards the development of an affordable and clean power sources mix in developing economies. A deduction was reached that there is an immense potential for power generation from affordable and clean energy sources as this bridges the enormous gap between power demand and supply as well as mitigates greenhouse gases (GHGs) effects.

AB  - Pasture-based and small-scale livestock farming systems are the main source of livelihood in the mountain primary sector, ensuring socioeconomic sustainability and biodiversity in rural communities throughout Europe and beyond. Mountain livestock farming (MLF) has attracted substantial research efforts from a wide variety of scientific communities worldwide. In this study, the use of text mining and topic modelling analysis drew a detailed picture of the main research topics dealing with MLF and their trends over the last four decades. The final data corpus used for the analysis counted 2 679 documents, of which 92% were peer-reviewed scientific publications. The number of scientific outputs in MLF doubled every 10 years since 1980. Text mining found that milk, goat and sheep were the terms with the highest weighed frequency in the data corpus. Ten meaningful topics were identified by topic analysis: T1-Livestock management and vegetation dynamics; T2-Animal health and epidemiology; T3-Methodological studies on cattle; T4-Production system and sustainability; T5-Methodological studies; T6-Wildlife and conservation studies; T7-Reproduction and performance; T8-Dairy/meat production and quality; T9-Land use and its change and T10-Genetic/genomic studies. A hierarchical dustering analysis was performed to explore the interrelationships among topics, and three main clusters were identified: the first focused on sustainability, conservation and socioeconomic aspects (T4; T6 and T9), the second was related to food production and quality (17 and T8) and the last one considered methodological studies on mountain flora and fauna (T1 ; 12; T3; TS and T10). The 10 topics identified represent a useful and a starting source of information for further and more detailed analysis (e.g. systematic review) of specific research or geographical areas. A truly holistic and interdisciplinary research approach is needed to identify drivers of change and to understand current and future challenges faced by livestock farming in mountain areas.

AB  - Due to the increasing energy demand worldwide and the resulting rising costs of conventional fuels, alternative energy sources could play a significant role towards global energy sustainability. Geothermal near-surface systems based on heat pumps have already proved to be a feasible option for the heating and cooling of buildings, while offering low CO2 footprint. In this study, the concept of using abandoned mines for geothermal heat recovery with either closed- or open-loop configurations is systematically reviewed based on 18 projects worldwide. Key engineering parameters such as temperature on depth, circulation flow rate, mine water quality, and end-users' location and demand have been used to characterize and classify the different projects. The study shows that the projects significantly differ from one another, thus highlighting the attractive versatility of this geothermal concept. A key outcome of this work is the development of a systematic procedure to evaluate future projects, followed by an example of a preliminary system design for a synthetic case scenario in the Harz region in Germany. After China's energy administration's recent announcement that the country will close 1,725 small-scale coal mines over the course of 2014 and considering the alarming levels of air pollution in the country, the concept of geothermal heat recovery from abandoned mines could become even more significant in the near future.

AB  - With the ever-increasing climate change, actions to reduce its negative impact while improving food and nutrition security are critical. This review is a retrospective analysis of climate adaptation strategies and implications for food and nutrition security among small-scale farmers in South Africa. The review used bibliometric analysis and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis to track research on implications of adaptation on food and nutrition security, identify adaptation strategies with implications on food and nutrition security and discuss the implications. The analysis shows a steady growth in the research field; however, whether the pace will accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 by 2030 is unknown. Institutional research collaboration is notable, although weak. The co-occurrence of keywords reflects Climate-Smart Agriculture and food and nutrition linkages, emphasizes the importance of farmers' perceptions on adopting measures to enhance food and nutrition security and illustrates the risk-vulnerability-resilience nexus. Adaptation measures with implications on food and nutrition security are varied, ranging from individual efforts to government-led initiatives. We recommend strengthening institutional research collaboration to accelerate the pace towards achieving zero hunger, food security and nutrition by 2030. It is also important to have an inclusive policy framework that addresses farmers' adaptation needs.

AB  - The evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture closely relate to ongoing studies of carbon budget, biological diversity, ecosystem services, indigenous wellbeing, and ethnic identities. Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture.

AB  - Due to increasing human transformation of virtually all habitats on Earth, setting global priorities for conservation is essential. The emerging disciplines of macroecology and macroevolution (MEE) can provide a global perspective and information for such prioritization but remain relatively separated from conservation prioritization, partly because MEE researchers are unaware of the requirements for effective conservation prioritization and existing approaches implementing these. Indeed, existing approaches for conservation prioritization at large scale are scattered across literature. Here, we systematically review this literature and provide a guideline for researchers in MEE as to which of approaches might be suitable for their needs. From >11 000 scientific publications, we identified 134 methods suitable for commonly used MEE data and geographic scale. Furthermore, we use a 'trait matrix' to identify families of similar approaches and to design a guideline to select the most suitable method, given a user-defined set of data and analysis scope. The guidelines are freely available via the conserveR R-package (<>). Finally, we used our review to identify increasing scalability, continuous monitoring and the integration of molecular, remote sensing and animal movement data as key areas for future impacts of MEE in conservation prioritization. We anticipate that our review can serve as a guide to MEE researchers interested in linking their data to conservation as well as for conservation scientists interested in using MEE approaches.

AB  - This systematic literature review is designed to evaluate the current state of knowledge in rural homestays and tourism academic literature. With reference to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart, we reviewed 94 studies published in the selected journals from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Our review explores how sustainable rural homestays have been previously researched in terms of the context, topic, sample, method, geographical location, and theoretical framework. The review provides insights on sustainability and rural homestay tourism from the perspective of co-occurrence beside highlighting the valuable content addressed by authors and suggesting future research directions. In a sustainable rural tourism context, only 51% of the reviewed studies had considered homestay as the core and independent area of inquiry. This review notes an increasing number of researchers from developing countries are working on community-based rural homestays, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Unfortunately, important topics-like homestay branding, homestay and entrepreneurship, homestays and information and communication technology (ICT) competency, homestay operator's training and development about sustainability-are rarely addressed in the existing literature.

AB  - Decent work and economic growth are fundamental elements for the sustainable development of a society, with Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG8) being one of the key objectives of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. The 5G network has great potential to contribute significantly to the achievement of SDG8, offering faster and more reliable connectivity, which opens up new possibilities for innovation, operational efficiency, and job creation. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 5G technologies concerning decent work and economic growth (SDG8). As part of the method, 265 articles extracted from main databases such as Scopus, IEEExplore, and ScienceDirect were analyzed using the PRISMA methodology, resulting in 74 relevant articles after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, a greater contribution to the use of the 5G network was identified in sectors such as manufacturing, health, and transportation, generating greater economic growth and job creation. It was also found that the technological applications with the greatest contributions are "Internet of Things" and "Artificial intelligence". Finally, it was concluded that the results of this review are useful for future research on technologies that support 5G networks, contributing to economic growth and equitable and sustainable decent work in a wide range of sectors and rural areas.

AB  - Urban areas continue to be the center of action for many countries due to their contribution to economic development. Many urban areas, through the urbanization process, have become vulnerable to climate risk, thereby making risk mitigation and adaptation essential components in urban planning. The study assessed the impacts of IPCC Assessment Reports (ARs) on academic research on risk mitigation and adaptation concerns in urban areas. The study systematically reviewed literature through searches of the Web of Science and Scopus databases; 852 papers were retrieved and 370 were deemed eligible. The results showed that the East Asia and Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia regions were most interested in IPCC ARs, while Sub-Saharan Africa showed little interest. Several urban concerns, including socio-economic, air quality, extreme temperature, sea level rise/flooding, health, and water supply/drought, were identified. Additionally, studies on negative health outcomes due to extreme temperatures and air pollution did not appear in the first four IPCC ARs. However, significant studies appeared after the launch of the AR5. Here, we must state that climate-related problems of urbanization were known and discussed in scientific papers well before the formation of the IPCC. For instance, the works of Clarke on urban structure and heat mortality and Oke on climatic impacts of urbanization. Though the IPCC ARs show impact, their emphasis on combined mitigation and adaptation policies is limited. This study advocates more combined risk mitigation and adaptation policies in urban areas for increased resilience to climate risk.

AB  - Studies of avian area sensitivity have been prolific over the last 3 decades, yet general conclusions about the phenomenon are lacking. We undertook a systematic literature review to determine how widespread area sensitivity is; whether published information is biased toward certain geographic regions, habitat types, or taxonomic groups; whether the nature of area effects varies with respect to these criteria; and whether tests of area effects for individual species produce consistent results. Analysis of over 2700 area sensitivity tests, from more than 870 species, indicated the phenomenon is widespread across regions, habitats, and taxonomic groups, but that significant biases in research focus exist. North American forest habitats and Passeriformes (especially Fringillidae, Regulidae, and Paridae) are disproportionately represented in the literature. Detection of area effects was more common in tests of occurrence (47%) than in those for abundance (25%) and varied significantly among regions, habitats, and taxonomic groups. Inconsistent results for species studied multiple times and between tests of occurrence and abundance were common. These results suggest a need for future research to focus more on why area sensitivity patterns differ among studies and less on simple pattern description.

AB  - The biofuel supply chain (BSC) management has received considerable attention in recent years for diversifying the energy matrix and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, despite the robust body of literature in studies addressing sustainable management and optimization, research integrating scarce resources in the production process still needs to be developed. Also, problems concerning the basic demands of water, energy, food, and land (WEFL) involve different levels of decision-making, multiple scales, and numerous stake-holders with different objectives. The synergistic management of these resources is called WEFL Nexus approach and constitutes one of the most complex sustainability challenges. Understanding the practical contributions of each dimension of the WEFL Nexus approach to biofuel supply chain management can make the concept more accessible to decision-makers and enable the formulation of practical and implementable programs. Based on this analysis, this article presents a systematic literature review and a meta-synthesis to highlight how the nexus approach contributes to the sustainable management of the biofuel supply chain. The results obtained in the research show that the WEFL Nexus approach can provide social and economic solutions for managing BSCs through the diversification of energy biomass sources, decontamination, use of wastewater, choosing the most appropriate locations for planting and installations according to geography, climate, and society, and meeting regional social demands for resources. Furthermore, this research shows that it is possible to optimize the use of resources while production flows are optimized.

AB  - While there is growing agreement on the competencies sustainability professionals should possess as well as the pedagogies to develop them, the practice of assessing students' sustainability competencies is still in its infancy. Despite growing interest among researchers, there has not yet been a systematic review of how students' sustainability competencies are currently assessed. This review article responds to this need by examining what tools are currently used for assessing students' sustainability competencies to inform future practice. A systematic literature review was conducted for publications through the end of 2019, resulting in 75 relevant studies that detail the use of an assessment tool. We analyzed the described tools regarding their main features, strengths and weaknesses, as well as potential improvements. Based on this analysis, we first propose a typology of eight assessment tools, which fall into three meta-types: self-perceiving, observation, and test-based approaches, providing specific examples of practice for all tools. We then articulate strengths and weaknesses as well as potential improvements for each tool (type). This study structures the field of sustainability competency assessment, provides a criteria-based overview of the currently used tools, and highlights promising future developments. For the practice, it provides guidance to sustainability (science) instructors, researchers, and program directors who are interested in using competencies assessment tools in more informed ways.

AB  - Supercapacitors are energy storage devices with high power density, rapid charge/discharge rate, and excellent cycle stability. Carbon-based supercapacitors are increasingly attracting attention because of their large surface area and high porosity. Carbon-based materials research has been recently centered on biomass-based materials due to the rising need to maintain a sustainable environment. Cellulose and lignin constitute the major components of lignocellulose biomass. Since they are renewable, sustainable, and readily accessible, lignin and cellulose-based supercapacitors are economically viable and environmentally friendly. This review aims to systematically analyze published research findings on electrospun lignin, cellulose, and lignin/cellulose nanofibers for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. A rigorous scientific approach was employed to screen the eligibility of relevant articles to be included in this study. The research questions and the inclusion criteria were clearly defined. The included articles were used to draw up the research framework and develop coherent taxonomy of literature. Taxonomy of research literature generated from the included articles was classified into review papers, electrospun lignin, cellulose, and lignin/cellulose nanofibers for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. Furthermore, challenges, recommendations, and research directions for future studies were equally discussed extensively. Before this study, no review on electrospun lignin/cellulose nanofiber-based supercapacitors has been reported. Thus, this systematic review will provide a reference for other researchers interested in developing biomass-based supercapacitors as an alternative to conventional supercapacitors based on petroleum products.

AB  - Pollution in urban environments has a direct impact on urban topsoils, which act as sinks and sources of trace elements. This article reviewed the contamination by trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni and Zn) in studies of 31 cities in Latin America, including the countries of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Cuba, and Mexico, between 2011 and 2020. The sample collection, analytical tools, references guidelines, range levels of trace elements and their related sources in urban topsoils are presented and were widely compared and discussed in this study. The results showed a great variation in methodologies approach related to sample collection and analytical tools. The type of occupation in urban areas, land use, local geological setting, historical development of anthropogenic actives and the distance of the sources were the most important factors that explain the levels of contamination found. The elements As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, were the most frequently pointed trace elements, with Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in high concentrations, related to anthropogenic sources (vehicular traffic, industrial emissions, and combustion of fossil fuels). On the other hand, Ni and Co were related to mixed sources (anthropogenic and natural). Among the studies, the highest concentrations of trace elements associated with industrial sources occur in Mexican cities. Vehicular traffic is pointed out as one of the main sources of contamination in Brazilian cities. Moreover, we discussed literature gaps and propose suggestions for future related studies.

AB  - Recent developments in manufacturing processes and automation have led to the new industrial revolution termed "Industry 4.0". Industry 4.0 can be considered as a broad domain which includes: data management, manufacturing competitiveness, production processes and efficiency. The term Industry 4.0 includes a variety of key enabling technologies i.e., cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and digital twins which can be considered as the major contributors to automated and digital manufacturing environments. Sustainability can be considered as the core of business strategy which is highlighted in the United Nations (UN) Sustainability 2030 agenda and includes smart manufacturing, energy efficient buildings and low-impact industrialization. Industry 4.0 technologies help to achieve sustainability in business practices. However, very limited studies reported about the extensive reviews on these two research areas. This study uses a systematic literature review approach to find out the current research progress and future research potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve manufacturing sustainability. The role and impact of different Industry 4.0 technologies for manufacturing sustainability is discussed in detail. The findings of this study provide new research scopes and future research directions in different research areas of Industry 4.0 which will be valuable for industry and academia in order to achieve manufacturing sustainability with Industry 4.0 technologies.

AB  - Knowledge translation (KT) is a set of activities or processes for synthesising, disseminating, and applying research evidence in decision-making for the benefit of society. For KT to be successful, it is paramount for researchers to play an active role in encouraging evidence uptake and use in decision -making. We carried out a mapping exercise and interviews with research cluster heads at Cochrane South Africa (CSA) of the KT activities and processes being implemented (or are planned for implementation). We organized the mapping and interview results according to the KT themes described in the Cochrane KT Framework. The KT framework comprises six themes, namely, (i) prioritization and co-production of research evidence; (ii) building a sustainable infrastructure for knowledge translation; (iii) engaging with audiences for knowledge exchange or dialogue; (iv) packaging, communication and dissemination which entails disseminating research to users; (v) building audience capacity to use evidence or training activities; and (vi) advocacy or improving the culture of using evidence. Through the mapping exercise and interviews, we learned that CSA researchers excelled in implementing activities and processes linked to most of the KT themes, including producing different types of systematic reviews and providing reliable evidence for health decision-making. Cochrane South Africa (CSA) researchers are also involved in mentoring and training postgraduate students and various health decision-makers (e.g., health professionals, guideline panels and policy-makers). While they excel in the above-mentioned activities, "packaging, communication, and dissemination of research evidence" (theme iv) was identified as an area of improvement.

AB  - Natural forests were increasingly replaced by plantations globally. While plantations support less biodiversity compared to natural forests, they can serve as an important habitat for forest-dependent species. Understanding the key drivers of the habitat function of plantations is necessary to reconcile both forestry and biodiversity. Planted tree species is one of the important factors determining biodiversity of plantations. Here, we systematically collected studies comparing the biodiversity between conifer plantations and natural forests, and conducted meta-analyses to quantify the effects of planted tree family/species (cypress family: Japanese cedar Cryptomeria japonica, Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtuse; pine family: Japanese larch Larix kaempferi, Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora, Todo fir Abies sachalinensis) on abundance and species richness of a wide range of taxa (all taxa, vertebrates, birds, invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, plants, and understorey plants) in plantations in Japan. Abundance and species richness in plantations relative to natural forests differed among planted tree family/species. In plantations of pine family (mainly larch), abundance or richness did not significantly differ from those in natural forests for many taxa, suggesting the important role as habitats. By contrast, in cypress family (mainly cedar), abundance or richness was significantly lower than in natural forests for all analysis groups except understorey abundance. These results indicate that the habitat function of plantations and its management should be considered for each planted tree species, separately. Nevertheless, since our literature review identifies some research gaps, e.g. studies on vertebrates in western Japan were scarce, more comprehensive research efforts should be made in the future.

AB  - In coastal ecosystems, non-indigenous species (NIS) are recognized as a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and socio-economic activities. Here we present a systematic review on the use of metabarcoding for NIS surveillance in marine and coastal ecosystems, through the analysis of 42 publications. Metabarcoding has been mainly applied to environmental DNA (eDNA) from water samples, but also to DNA extracted from bulk or- ganismal samples. DNA extraction kits have been widely used and the 18S rRNA and the COI genes the most employed markers, but less than half of the studies targeted more than one marker loci. The Illumina MiSeq platform has been used in >50% of the publications. Current weaknesses include potential occurrence of false negatives due to the primer-biased or faulty DNA amplification and the incompleteness of reference libraries. This is particularly concerning in the case of NIS surveillance, where proficiency in species level detection is critical. Until these weaknesses are resolved, ideally NIS metabarcoding should be supported by complementary approaches, such as morphological analysis or more targeted molecular approaches (e.g. qPCR, ddPCR). Even so, metabarcoding has already proved to be a highly sensitive tool to detect small organisms or undifferentiated life stages across a wide taxonomic range. In addition, it also seems to be very effective in ballast water management and to improve the spatial and temporal sampling frequency of NIS surveillance in marine and coastal ecosystems. Although specific protocols may be required for species-specific NIS detection, for general monitoring it would be vital to settle on a standard protocol able to generate comparable results among surveillance campaigns and regions of the globe, seeking the best approach for detecting the broadest range of species, while minimizing the chances of a false positive or negative detection.

AB  - Background Gestational diabetes (GDM) is the commonest metabolic disorder of pregnancy. Most women with GDM are treated with nutritional management alone. There are conflicting guidelines surrounding its dietary management and this has resulted in a lack of conformity to the dietary advice currently prescribed. There is also conflicting opinions to the effectiveness of dietary management of GDM on pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this review was to examine the scientific evidence for the optimal nutritional management of GDM.
   Methods A Medline search of all English papers published between 1995 and 2001 that cross-referenced GDM with diet was under taken. Because of the poor quality of many of these papers, literature prior to 1995 known to the authors and considered relevant to the review were also included.
   Results The evidence base in this area is of poor quality. One systematic review based on randomized control trials failed to show any benefit from dietary intervention in GDM. However, that review did not include informative clinical and observational studies that are not classified as randomized controlled trials. Overall current evidence points to the effectiveness of dietary advice as a means of improving maternal hyperglycaemia and reducing the risk of accelerated foetal growth. The evidence surrounding energy restriction, carbohydrate and fat manipulation in GDM remains controversial.
   Conclusions Current but limited evidence supports dietary alterations to reduce rates of accelerated foetal growth. There is a clear need for good quality randomized control trials in this area.

AB  - Retired electric-vehicle lithium-ion battery (EV-LIB) packs pose severe environmental hazards. Efficient recovery of these spent batteries is a significant way to achieve closed-loop lifecycle management and a green circular economy. It is crucial for carbon neutralization, and for coping with the environmental and resource challenges associated with the energy transition. EV-LIB disassembly is recognized as a critical bottleneck for mass-scale recycling. Automated disassembly of EV-LIBs is extremely challenging due to the large variety and uncertainty of retired EV-LIBs. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) provide new ways for addressing these problems.
   This study aims to provide a systematic review and forward-looking perspective on how AI/ML methodology can significantly boost EV-LIB intelligent disassembly for achieving sustainable recovery. This work examines the key advances and research opportunities of emerging intelligent technologies for EV-LIB disassembly, and recycling and reuse of industrial products in general. We show that AI could benefit the whole disassembly process, particularly addressing the uncertainty and safety issues. Currently, EV-LIB state prognostics, disassembly decision-making as well as target detection are indicated as promising areas to realize intelligence. The challenges still exist for extensive autonomy due to present AI's inherent limitations, mechanical and chemical complexities, and sustainable benefits concerns. This paper provides the practical map to direct how to implement EV-LIB intelligent disassembly as well as forward-looking perspectives for addressing these challenges.

AB  - The concept of a smart city is widely implemented all over the world, and this fact creates both possibilities and new challenges for all participants and stakeholders of the process. This study examines the implementation of smart governance in the context of smart cities. The goal of the research is to distinguish between the effects and externalities of the smart governance domain, both positive and negative ones; the effects and externalities are elicited from the outcomes of smart governance implementation revealed from a review of scientific publications devoted to the results, barriers, and facilitators of smart governance functioning. The publications were selected according to a systematic review methodology, then the selected articles were analyzed and the factors that foster the processes of smart governance implementation (facilitators) or vice versa hamper the acquisition of results (barriers), as well as the outcomes of smart governance, were extracted. The extracted factors were attributed to six areas: Information, Efficiency, Citizen-Centricity, Transparency, Digital Divide, and Regulation. Further, the outcomes of smart governance implementation were distinguished as effects and externalities, which were both positive and negative.

AB  - As climate change is exacerbated and existing resources are depleted, the need for sustainable industries becomes ever so important. Aviation is not an exception. Despite the overall carbon dioxide emissions related to the aviation sector accounts for 2%-4% currently, forecasts for air travel indicate an annual growth of 3%- 5% and other industries present more potential to reduce carbon emissions once they recur to an increasing use of renewable energies. This option is more difficult in aeronautics since an efficient and lighter energy storage system is required and the current state of the art in battery technology is far from the specific energy densities of fossil fuels and its production is not friendly to the environment. Thus, a herculean effort to integrate several promising mitigation strategies in an efficient way is required. In this paper, a review of the most upfront solutions towards greener aviation is presented and categorized as follows: concepts of operations, energy storage, propulsion systems, aerodynamics, structures, materials, and manufacturing processes. In the end, potential synergies between the different technologies to achieve green aviation are proposed.

AB  - The processes related to solid waste management (SWM) are being revised as new technologies emerge and are applied in the area to achieve greater environmental, social and economic sustainability for society. To achieve our goal, two robust review protocols (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context (PICOC) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)) were used to systematically analyze 62 documents extracted from the Web of Science database to identify the main techniques and tools for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) as applied to SWM and explore the technological potential to optimize the stages of collecting and transporting waste. Moreover, it was possible to analyze the main challenges and opportunities of KDD and DM for SWM. The results show that the most used tools for SWM are MATLAB (29.7%) and GIS (13.5%), whereas the most used techniques are Artificial Neural Networks (35.8%), Linear Regression (16.0%) and Support Vector Machine (12.3%). In addition, 15.3% of the studies were conducted with data from China, 11.1% from India and 9.7% of the studies analyzed and compared data from several other countries. Furthermore, the research showed that the main challenges in the field of study are related to the collection and treatment of data, whereas the opportunities appear to be linked mainly to the impact on the pillars of sustainable development. Thus, this study portrays important issues associated with the use of KDD and DM for optimal SWM and has the potential to assist and direct researchers and field professionals in future studies.

AB  - Systematic reviews are the method of choice to synthesize research evidence. To identify main topics (so-called hot spots) relevant to large corpora of original publications in need of a synthesis, one must address the "three Vs" of big data (volume, velocity, and variety), especially in loosely defined or fragmented disciplines. For this purpose, text mining and predictive modeling are very helpful. Thus, we applied these methods to a compilation of documents related to digitalization in aesthetic, arts, and cultural education, as a prototypical, loosely defined, fragmented discipline, and particularly to quantitative research within it (QRD-ACE). By broadly querying the abstract and citation database Scopus with terms indicative of QRD-ACE, we identified a corpus of N = 55,553 publications for the years 2013-2017. As the result of an iterative approach of text mining, priority screening, and predictive modeling, we identified n = 8,304 potentially relevant publications of which n = 1,666 were included after priority screening. Analysis of the subject distribution of the included publications revealed video games as a first hot spot of QRD-ACE. Topic modeling resulted in aesthetics and cultural activities on social media as a second hot spot, related to 4 of k = 8 identified topics. This way, we were able to identify current hot spots of QRD-ACE by screening less than 15% of the corpus. We discuss implications for harnessing text mining, predictive modeling, and priority screening in future research syntheses and avenues for future original research on QRD-ACE.

AB  - In the past 5 years, scholarly and policy attention to relational values, a concept that articulates plural values of nature, has grown steadily. To date, there are no published syntheses of empirical research that explicitly addresses relational values. We perform a systematic literature review of n = 72 empirical studies of relational values to summarize the state of current research and to identify opportunities for future research and conceptual development. In our analysis, we categorize what authors identify as relational values and summarize study characteristics (e.g. study location, methods approach). Authors collectively report n = 312 unique relational values. Categories of identity, social cohesion, livelihoods, connection to place/human-nature connection and sacred are most common. Scholarship that explicitly addresses relational values has increased since 2017 and exhibits substantial diversity: in how relational values are conceptualized (or not); in disciplinary associations; in geographical location and in data collection methods. We find that most empirical research on relational values does not justify how its results reflect characteristics that establish the relational values concept as unique from other environmental values concepts. As a result, diverse interpretations of the relational values concept pose the risk of the relational values concept being so broad and inclusive that it becomes meaningless, or at least meaning-light. Policy implications. Understanding why and how nature matters to people is critical to inform effective and just conservation. Relational values can offer nuanced perspectives on the significance associated with people-nature relationships. We argue that empirical relational values research that grounds itself in the concept's 'core' characteristics can foster conceptual coherence and bolster the relevance of research findings to sustainability and conservation science.

AB  - The possibilities of applying Operations Research (O.R.) techniques in the design of real-world systems are vast. The optimization and design of the supply chain network (SCN) is one of the relevant topics that has directed the attention of many scholars. Sound decisions in this regard, including the proper selection of the facility's location, transportation modes and routes and inventory management policies, can noticeably improve the systems performance. Over 380 articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the ISI/ Web of Science database have applied advanced O. R. techniques in SCN optimization studies. This paper offers a systematic review of these published contributions by focusing on two categories of O. R. approaches most recently applied for the design of SC systems: integrated mathematical modeling and simulation-optimization (S-O) frameworks. A taxonomy analysis of the mentioned approaches is presented based on the supply chain elements. A bibliometric analysis is also conducted to provide technical insights into the possible gaps in the field. Moreover, the relevant studies on SC sustainability are highlighted. The research results are supportive of the S-O frameworks as either an alternative approach or an effective solution method for the integrated problems. The research outcomes can provide researchers in the field with useful details of the integrated problems and S-O frameworks as the most recent O. R. methodologies in the field of SC optimization.

AB  - Objective: Prevalence estimates of delayed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have varied widely in the literature. This study is the first to establish the prevalence of delayed PTSD in prospective studies and to evaluate associated factors through meta-analytic techniques.
   Data sources; Studies were located by an electronic search using the databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Search terms were posttraumatic stress disorder [include all subheadings] AND (delayed OR prospective OR longitudinal OR follow-up). Results were limited to journal articles published between 1980 and April 4, 2008.
   Study selection: We included longitudinal, prospective studies of humans exposed to a potentially traumatic event that assessed participants at I to 6 months after the event, that included a follow-up of at least 12 months after the event, and that specified rates of new onset and remission between assessments in study completers.
   Data extraction: Data were extracted concerning the study design, demographic features, and event-related characteristics and the number of PTSD cases at first assessment, the number of PTSD cases among study dropouts, and the number of new event-related PTSD cases at each subsequent assessment among study completers. Data from 24 studies were included. Four of these provided additional data on initial subthreshold PTSD and subsequent risk of delayed PTSD.
   Data synthesis: The proportion of PTSD cases with delayed PTSD was 24.8% (95% CI = 22.6% to 27.2%) after adjusting for differences in study methodology, demographic features, and event-related characteristics. Military combat exposure, Western cultural background, and lower cumulative PTSD incidence were associated with delayed PTSD. Participants with initial subthreshold PTSD were at increased risk of developing delayed PTSD.
   Conclusions: Delayed PTSD was found among about a quarter of PTSD cases and represents exacerbations of prior symptoms. J Clin Psychiatry 2009,70(11):1572-1582 (C) Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the effects of roads on wildlife have been extensively studied. Theoretically, railways cause similar effects as well, yet ecologists do not understand the magnitude of these effects. Despite the field of road ecology rapidly expanding and the large footprint created by railways, there is a prominent lack of research related to railways and their effects on wildlife. To emphasize gaps between road and railway wildlife studies, we performed a thorough systematic review of twelve peer-reviewed journals in which ecologists and conservation biologists commonly publish. We found a clear underrepresentation of railway studies despite the potential negative ecological effects associated with this important anthropogenic feature. We found 259 road-wildlife articles and only 17 railway-wildlife articles in the journals we assessed with the majority of road studies focused in North America and the majority of railway studies in Europe. Although road-wildlife studies have increased through time, railway-wildlife studies have remained stagnant. In our opinion, the development of research pertaining to 'Railway Ecology' is long overdue. (C) 2016 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - For decades, lightweight concrete has been used in various civil engineering applications. Cellular concrete is a type of lighweight concrete that is an emerging composite in materials engineering still. However, due to its low weight, it can be integrated with industrial by-products to develop more advanced composites such as ultra-lightweight cellular concrete (ULCC). ULCC is sustainable and regarded as a potential candidate due to its simplicity of use and other benefits. A systematic review of the potential applications of ULCC in geotechnical construction are presented in this review article. Due to technological breakthroughs and changes in environmental conditions, and their material property is one of the variables that influence the degradation of roadway. Several investigations have been conducted by incorporating different materials into pavement structures to achieve longer-lasting and better pavement infrastructures than those at present. Sustainability benefits, workability, low prices, time, and structural capacity are factors that have been widely focused. This study focuses on the raw materials, production techniques, types, and properties of the ULCCs. The boundary densities of the ULCCs were considered from 400 to 1600 kg/m3. Structures all across the globe have benefited from the usage of cellular concrete in some form or another. However, much work in this field should be focused on, particularly in geotechnical applications. Geotechnical applications need specific attention to develop this kind of concrete with enhanced qualities. In order to address this need, this review

AB  - The Water-Food Nexus (WF) has been proposed to reach equitable, balanced, and sustainable access to water and food resources in the face of the growing population demand. Therefore, developing models to assess them has become more relevant. This work systematically reviews the literature on the tools used to evaluate water and food resources between 2002 and 2020. Furthermore, it reports a critical analysis of the software used to assess the WF Nexus quantitatively. The models analyzed were Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact (CAPRI), Global Food and Water System (GFWS), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Water Evaluation And Planning system (WEAP), and Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP). We deduced that the following are necessary in evaluating the WF Nexus: (1) the capacity to generate future scenarios, (2) a global application, and (3) the application in case studies. The present paper is the first review to provide an overview of the software applied to evaluate WF Nexus, including the advantages and disadvantages of the tools found. They can help build sustainability criteria when designing policies that reduce water and food security risks and promote efficient water and food use.

AB  - A meta-analysis is a statistical treatment of a dataset derived from a literature review. Meta-analysis appears to be a promising approach in agricultural and environmental sciences, but its implementation requires special care. We assessed the quality of the meta-analyses carried out in agronomy, with the intent to formulate recommendations, and we illustrate these recommendations with a case study relative to the estimation of nitrous oxide emission in legume crops. Eight criteria were defined for evaluating the quality of 73 meta-analyses from major scientific journals in the domain of agronomy. Most of these meta-analyses focused on production aspects and the impact of agriculture activities on the environment or biodiversity. None of the 73 meta-analyses reviewed satisfied all eight quality criteria and only three satisfied six criteria. Based on this quality assessment, we formulated the following recommendations: (i) the procedure used to select papers from scientific databases should be explained, (ii) individual data should be weighted according to their level of precision when possible, (iii) the heterogeneity of data should be analyzed with random-effect models, (iv) sensitivity analysis should be carried out and (v) the possibility of publication bias should be investigated. Our case study showed that meta-analysis techniques would be beneficial to the assessment of environmental impacts because they make it possible to study between site-year variability, to assess uncertainty and to identify the factors with a potential environmental impact. The quality criteria and recommendations presented in this paper could serve as a guide to improve future meta-analyses made in this area. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The circular economy (CE) is an evolving subject transitioning from conceptualization to empirical testing. Over the past decade, researchers have done an exhaustive study to understand the concept of CE and its realized values both financially and environmentally on organizations that have traditional business models based on linear consumption. For understanding the transitional phenomena completely, the paper aims to review the current and emerging research trends in CE to ascertain future direction. Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted on 91 articles published in the study area during the past decade (2016-2021) in renowned peer-reviewed journals. The criteria set to review literature are based on the following assortment: CE drivers, CE barriers, definitions by different authors, yearly distribution of the publication, research publisher and journals, google citation and methodology used in the selected research articles. Findings The study suggests that researchers from the selected years are keen to understand the transition and its critical factors by bringing forward frameworks and incorporating CE with digital technologies. The digital technology implied are Industrial Technology (IR) 4.0, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Data Analytics to increase organizational and environmental performance. CE researchers need to use empirical testing in different sectors to understand and bring forward more improvised business models and practices according to the dynamics of the industry. Originality/value The literature review suggests gaps exist to integrate the micro, meso and macro levels to get CE implementation's system-wide benefits. The study has also identified that many CE frameworks available in the literature for implementation must be empirically tested to yield performance results.

AB  - In many areas of the world, maintaining grapevine production will require adaptation to climate change. While rigorous evaluations of adaptation strategies provide decision makers with valuable insights, those that are published often overlook major constraints, ignore local adaptive capacity, and suffer from a compartmentalization of disciplines and scales. The objective of our study was to identify current knowledge of evaluation methods and their limitations, reported in the literature. We reviewed 111 papers that evaluate adaptation strategies in the main vineyards worldwide. Evaluation approaches are analyzed through key features (e.g., climate data sources, methodology, evaluation criteria) to discuss their ability to address climate change issues, and to identify promising outcomes for climate change adaptations. We highlight the fact that combining adaptation levers in the short and long term (location, vine training, irrigation, soil, and canopy management, etc.) enables local compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine productivity. The main findings of the paper are three-fold: (1) the evaluation of a combination of adaptation strategies provides better solutions for adapting to climate change; (2) multi-scale studies allow local constraints and opportunities to be considered; and (3) only a small number of studies have developed multi-scale and multi-lever approaches to quantify feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation. In addition, we found that climate data sources were not systematically clearly presented, and that climate uncertainty was hardly accounted for. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed the economic impacts of adaptation, especially at farm scale. We conclude that the development of methodologies to evaluate adaptation strategies, considering both complementary adaptations and scales, is essential if relevant information is to be provided to the decision-makers of the wine industry.

AB  - Background
   Marine species can demonstrate strong genetic differentiation and population structure despite the hypothesis of open seas and high connectivity. Some suggested drivers causing the genetic breaks are oceanographic barriers and the species' biology. We assessed the relevance of seven major oceanographic fronts on species connectivity while considering their dispersal capacity and life strategy.
   Methods
   We systematically reviewed the scientific articles reporting population genetic differentiation along the Mediterranean Sea and across the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition. We retained those considering at least one sampling locality at each side of an oceanographic front, and at least two localities with no-front between them to correctly assess the effect of the front. To estimate the impact of life history characteristics affecting connectivity we considered the planktonic larval duration (PLD) and adult life strategy.
   Results
   Oceanographic barriers in the Mediterranean Sea seem to reduce gene flow globally; however, this effect is not homogeneous considering the life history traits of the species. The effect of the oceanographic fronts reduces gene flow in highly mobile species with PLD larger than 2-4 weeks. Benthic sessile species and/or with short PLD (< 2 weeks) have more significant genetic breaks between localities than species with higher motility; however, genetic differentiation occurs independently of the presence of a front.
   Conclusion
   Genetic connectivity is important for populations to recover from anthropogenic or natural impacts. We show that species with low mobility, mostly habitat-formers, have high genetic differentiation but low gene flow reduction mediated by the front, therefore, considering the importance of these species, we emphasize the vulnerability of the Mediterranean ecosystems and the necessity of protection strategies based on the whole ecosystem.

AB  - Several factors have led to an increase in the focus on sustainable development. In this context, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) has gained tremendous momentum in research and implementation. Fitted into CE's concept, the Life Extension Strategies (LES) have been popular among industrial practitioners, regulators, policymakers, and academics from different industries due to the several benefits of these strategies. The general scope of this study is to approach LES within the industrial environment. The main goal is to understand how Remanufacturing and Refurbishment (R/R) strategies have been applied in different industry types. To achieve this goal, we carried out a systematic literature review whereby we captured some examples of R/R applications that demonstrate the potential of application to various industries (e.g., aerospace/aeronautics, energy power, and automotive industries) and equipment types (e.g., nuclear reactor, hydropower plant, and turbine blades). We also described some strategies to implement LES (e.g., economic analysis and life cycle assessment) and the different impacts achieved or expected (life extension, cost-saving, and efficiency enhancement). Moreover, we discussed three specific points concerning R/R application, the LES categorization, and the inexistence of a multi-dimensional framework to LES.

AB  - Although Urban Underground Space (UUS), regarded as a new dimension of cities, is one of the efficient responses to urbanisation issues and the overall sustainability agenda, many sustainable issues remain, such as high energy consumption. To maximise the prospects for the sustainable development of UUS, numerous scholars are devoted to exploring the energy-saving potential of UUS and the feasibility of utilising clean underground energy while preserving a pleasant environment. However, most of these studies are from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning perspectives, with an emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of the active system. Given the potential for energy savings at the early planning and design stages, it is significant for architects and planners to further research on green building design strategies and technologies to reduce energy consumption and realise sustainable development. Hence, a comprehensive study that collects and analyses the relevant literature based on a set of precisely defined criteria to comprehend the development and present status of the design considerations for low-carbon UUS would make a timely and valuable contribution to advancing the understanding of this topic. Through exploring the rationale behind the high energy consumption in UUS, metrics for evaluating the performance and the relationship between the form and performance, this study seeks to provide researchers and practitioners with an up-to-date understanding of the sustainability framework of low-carbon UUS and the critical messages regarding the challenges and successes associated with its contribution to global sustainable development.

AB  - Quantitative genetic traits provide insights into the evolutionary potential of populations, as heritability estimates measure the population's ability to respond to global changes. Although wild and managed bees are increasingly threatened by the degradation of natural habitats and climate change, risking plant biodiversity and agriculture production, no study has yet performed a systematic review of heritability estimates across the group. Here we help fill this knowledge gap, gathering all available heritability estimates for ants, bees, and wasps, evaluating which factors affect these estimates and assessing the reported genetic correlations between traits. Using a model selection approach to analyze a dataset of more than 800 heritability estimates, we found that heritability is influenced by trait type, with morphological traits exhibiting the highest heritability estimates, and defense and metabolism-related traits showing the lowest estimates. Study system, sociality degree, experimental design, estimation type (narrow or broad-sense heritability), and sample size were not found to affect heritability estimates. Results remained unaltered when correcting for phylogenetic inertia, and when analyzing social bees separately. Genetic correlations between honeybee traits revealed both positive coefficients, usually for traits in the same category, and negative coefficients, suggesting trade-offs among other traits. We discuss these findings and highlight the importance of maintaining genetic variance in fitness-related traits. Our study shows the importance of considering heritability estimates and genetic correlations when designing breeding and conservation programs. We hope this meta-analysis helps identify sustainable breeding approaches and conservation strategies that help safeguard the evolutionary potential of wild and managed bees.

AB  - The wide knowledge gaps in invasion biology research that exist in the developing world are crucial impediments to the scientific management and global policymaking on biological invasions. In an effort to fill such knowledge gaps, we present here an inventory of the alien flora of India, based on systematic reviews and rigorous analyses of research studies (ca. 190) published over the last 120 years (1890-2010 AD), and updated with field records of the last two decades. Currently, the inventory comprises of 1,599 species, belonging to 842 genera in 161 families, and constitutes 8.5% of the total Indian vascular flora. The three most species-rich families are Asteraceae (134 spp.), Papilionaceae (114 spp.) and Poaceae (106 spp.), and the three largest genera are Eucalyptus (25 spp.), Ipomoea (22 spp.), and Senna (21 spp.). The majority of these species (812) have no report of escaping from cultivation. Of the remaining subset of 787 species, which have either escaped from intentional cultivation, or spread after unintentional introduction, casuals are represented by 57 spp., casual/naturalised by 114 spp., naturalised by 257 spp., naturalised/invasive by 134 spp., and invasive by 225 spp. Biogeographically, more than one-third (35%) of the alien flora in India has its native ranges in South America, followed by Asia (21%), Africa (20%), Europe (11%), Australia (8%), North America (4%); and cryptogenic (1%). The inventory is expected to serve as the scientific baseline on plant invasions in India, with implications for conservation of global biodiversity.

AB  - PurposeThis research aims to use meta-analytical structural equation modeling to look into how hospitality employees use technology at work. It further investigates if the relationship between the constructs of the technology acceptance model (TAM) is moderated by job level (supervisory versus non-supervisory) and different cultures (eastern versus western). Design/methodology/approachIn total, 140 relationships from 30 empirical studies (N = 6,728) were used in this study's data analysis in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. FindingsThe findings demonstrated that perceived usefulness had a greater influence on "user attitudes" and "acceptance intention" than perceived ease of use. This study also identified that the effect sizes of relationships among TAM constructs appeared to be greater for supervisory employees or in eastern cultures than for those in non-supervisory roles or western cultures. Practical implicationsThe findings provide valuable information for practitioners to increase the adoption of employee technology. Practitioners need to focus on the identification of hospitality employee attitudes, social norms and perceived ease of use. Moreover, hospitality practitioners should be cautious when promoting the adoption of new technologies to employees, as those at different levels may respond differently. Originality/valueThis is the very first empirical investigation to meta-analyze the predictive power of the TAM in the context of hospitality staff technology adoption at the workplace. The findings also demonstrated differences in the predictive power of TAM constructs according to job level and cultural differences.

AB  - The agro-food system needs a genuine sustainability transition to achieve sustainable food and nutrition security in the face of climate change, population growth, ecosystem degradation and increasing resource scarcity. Agro-food sustainability transitions refer to transformation processes needed to move towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. There is a broad range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks that have been used to understand and promote transition towards sustainability. These include the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, transition management (TM), strategic niche management (SNM), technological innovation system (TIS) and social practice approach (SPA). The paper analyses the use of these heuristic frameworks in research on agro-food sustainability transitions. A search carried out in March 2018 on Scopus yielded 791 documents, and 127 research articles underwent a systematic review. Results show that more than three-fifths of research papers dealing with sustainability transitions in agriculture, food processing, distribution and consumption use at least one of the five heuristic frameworks (MLP, TM, SNM, TIS and SPA). The MLP is the most prominent framework in research on agro-food sustainability transitions, followed by TM, SPA, SNM and then TIS. Nevertheless, MLP is increasingly complemented with frameworks that focus on human-related and social factors (SPA), management and governance (TM, SNM) or agency and interactions between actors (TIS) in sustainability transitions processes. Therefore, the paper makes the case for more integration of transition frameworks in order to better nurture and foster transitions towards sustainable agro-food systems.

AB  - The present work presents a review of literature reviews in the area of recycling/reusing/re-manufacturing supply chain research. It also highlights the contribution of the review papers published in this area. To collect the sample, we use the well-reputed search engine: SCOPUS and then screening it categorically and descriptively to finalise the sample for the study. A category, impact, and topic-related classification schemes are developed, and the 67 review works existed in our final sample are discussed in the light of these classification schemes. Sustainability has three different facets: environmental, economic, and social. Achieving sustainability for enhancing the quality of the environment, cost-effective economic concern, and benefit of society is the priority in most of the articles. The study identifies several emerging issues like ways of utilisation of food and vegetable waste, ways of collection of rare earth metals from secondary sources, integration of reverse and forward supply chain, sustainable smart and flexible production system, etc., to give higher preferences for future research. The classification framework presented in this article may assist researchers to realise research gaps and help them in writing high-quality research work in the future.

AB  - A technique called biofloc technology (BFT) is an environmentally friendly method for aquaculture in which a successful growing cycle depends on the maintenance and monitoring of water quality parameters. Studies have revealed that improving water quality in BFT and maintaining the safety range of the parameters can help to increase the growth performance of cultured species. Following a systematic review of the literature, a meta-analysis was performed to explore how some important water parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrite (NO2-N), nitrate (NO3-N), ammonia (NH3-N), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total suspended solids (TSS), and alkalinity were influenced by different BFT systems. The PRISMA screening process was followed, and 33 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The meta-analyses showed that NO2-N and TSS were significantly affected by BFT, while pH, DO, NO3-N, NH3-N, TAN, and alkalinity were not significantly influenced by this system. The analyses revealed that NO2-N had a significant negative effect size due to BFT, whereas TSS showed a significant positive effect size. The study also revealed some publication bias in which few experiments of some studies showed extremely positive and negative effect sizes due to BFT application in the system. Overall, the findings suggest clear evidence of the profound influence of BFT on the water quality parameters in different aquaculture systems, suggesting the future development of BFT for sustainable and environmentally friendly aquaculture production.

AB  - Background There is a striking latitudinal gradient in multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence, but exceptions in Mediterranean Europe and northern Scandinavia, and some systematic reviews, have suggested that the gradient may be an artefact. The authors sought to evaluate the association between MS prevalence and latitude by meta-regression.
   Methods and findings Studies were sourced from online databases, reference mining and author referral. Prevalence estimates were age-standardised to the 2009 European population. Analyses were carried out by means of random-effects meta-regression, weighted with the inverse of within-study variance. The authors included 650 prevalence estimates from 321 peer-reviewed studies; 239 were age-standardised, and 159 provided sex-specific data. The authors found a significant positive association (change in prevalence per degree-latitude) between age-standardised prevalence (1.04, p<0.001) and latitude that diminished at high latitudes. Adjustment for prevalence year strengthened the association with latitude (2.60, p<0.001). An inverse gradient in the Italian region reversed on adjustment for MS-associated HLA-DRB1 allele distributions. Adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies did not appreciably alter the gradient in Europe. Adjustment for some potential sources of bias did not affect the observed associations.
   Conclusion This, the most comprehensive review of MS prevalence to date, has confirmed a statistically significant positive association between MS prevalence and latitude globally. Exceptions to the gradient in the Italian region and northern Scandinavia are likely a result of genetic and behavioural-cultural variations. The persistence of a positive gradient in Europe after adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies strongly supports a role for environmental factors which vary with latitude, the most prominent candidates being ultraviolet radiation (UVR)/vitamin D.

AB  - Offshore oil and gas drilling operations are going to remote and harsh arctic environments with demands for heightened safety and resilience of operational facilities. The remote and harsh environment is characterized by extreme waves, wind, storms, currents, ice, and fog that hinder drilling operations and cause structural failures of critical offshore infrastructures. The risk, safety, reliability, and integrity challenges in harsh environment op-erations are critically high, and a comprehensive understanding of these factors will aid operations and protect the investment. The dynamics, environmental constraints, and the associated risk of the critical offshore infras-tructures for safe design, installation, and operations are reviewed to identify the current state of knowledge. This paper introduces a systematic review of harsh environment characterization by exploring the metocean phenomena prevalent in harsh environments and their effects on the floating offshore structures performance and supporting systems. The dynamics of the floating systems are described by their six degrees of freedom and their associated risk scenarios. The systematic methodology further explores the qualitative, quantitative, and consequences modeling techniques for risk analysis of floating offshore systems in a harsh environment. While presenting the current state of knowledge, the study also emphasizes a way forward for sustainable offshore op-erations. The study shows that the current state of knowledge is inexhaustive and will require further research to develop a design that minimizes interruption during remote harsh offshore operations. Resilient innovation, IoT and digitalization provide opportunities to fill some of the challenges of remote Arctic offshore operations.

AB  - Reverse Logistics (RL) of end-of-use/end-of-life products has become a vital part of circular economy practices for manufacturers. However, significant quantities of resources are still landfilled instead of being recovered. With mounting pressure on businesses to address the sustainability crises (resources, climate change, waste, toxicity) on account of the take-make-dispose-based linear economy, companies today realise the importance of RL but face several barriers to implementing it, including a lack of knowledge. Although several studies have investigated different aspects of RL in various industries in different country settings, less attention has been devoted to developing a systematic and holistic approach for designing and implementing RL. To address these gaps, this paper reviews 116 scholarly articles published between 2011 and 2021 to identify attributes related to the design and implementation of RL systems. Based on a systematic literature review, a conceptual framework is presented covering the key activities, drivers and barriers, stakeholder engagement and performance manage-ment in RL. Such a framework can support companies evaluate different approaches and strategies, as well as the opportunities and challenges of designing and implementing RL and transitioning towards a Circular Economy.

AB  - Bike-sharing is known as a sustainable form of transportation. This travel mode is able to tackle the "last mile" transit issue and deliver financial, well-being, and low-carbon lifestyle advantages to users. To date, many studies have analysed the influence of various factors, including built environments, on bike-sharing ridership. However, no study has exclusively synthesised these findings regarding the association between built-environment attributes and bike-sharing ridership. Thus, in this study, a systematic literature review was conducted on 39 eligible studies. These studies were assessed with respect to (1) bike-sharing usage, (2) studies' geographical distribution, (3) data collection and analysis method, and (4) built environment factor type. Most studies were carried out in the US and Chinese cities. Variables associated with diversity, density, and distance to public transport stations and public transport infrastructure were frequently employed by the studies reviewed. It was found that BS stations with an average capacity of 24.63 docks and street network systems with an average length of 12.57 km of cycling lanes had a significant impact on the bike-sharing ridership. The findings of these studies were combined, and a series of recommendations were proposed based on them for bike-sharing service providers and researchers in academia. The findings of this evaluation can help practitioners and scholars understand the important built environment elements that influence bike-sharing ridership. Knowledge in this field will enable bike-sharing service providers to direct their resources sufficiently to enhance the more essential aspects of bike-sharing users' satisfaction.

AB  - Storks are a conspicuous pan-global freshwater flagship taxon with 20 extant species, all of which have been accorded IUCN Red List status. Red List assessments use a combination of scientific evidence and expert inputs to develop species-level status, but there is little careful evaluation of whether these assessments are comparable across species. Using standard literature databases, we compiled and analysed patterns of research in peer-reviewed literature for all 20 stork species. Our search yielded 989 publications between 1950 and 2022, showing bias in both the coverage of species (66 % covered three stork species) and geographical locations (53.8 % from Europe and the United States of America) despite the highest stork species richness being present in Africa and Asia. Publications on storks, especially from Asia, have increased over time, with 81 % of all studies published since 2000. Most stork research focused on breeding ecology, but was skewed toward only three species. Growing research in Asia showed significant populations of several stork species amid farmlands, sug-gesting the need to advance similar research in anthropogenically modified landscapes elsewhere. The popula-tion and behaviour ecologies of 15 (75 %) stork species remain unstudied. Our review showed scientific evidence varying enormously across stork species, with sparse scientific understanding being the norm. Red List statuses must be made more robust for storks, especially highlighting data-deficient species to help prioritize conserva-tion research, particularly in Africa and Asia, thereby facilitating the development of accurate status assessments for these species.

AB  - This study addresses the pressing need to evaluate the life cycle assessment (LCA) of electric vehicles (EVs) in comparison to traditional vehicles, amid growing environmental concerns and the quest for sustainable transportation alternatives. Through a systematic four-stage literature review, it strives to provide essential insights into the environmental impact, energy consumption, and resource utilization associated with EVs, thereby informing well-informed decisions in the transition to more sustainable transportation systems. The study's findings underscore a compelling environmental advantage of EVs. They emit a staggering 97% less CO2 equivalent emissions when compared to petrol vehicles, and a significant 70% less compared to their diesel counterparts, rendering them a crucial instrument in the battle against climate change. These environmental benefits are intricately linked to the adoption of clean energy sources and advanced battery technology. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential for additional emissions reduction through the extension of EV lifespans achieved by recycling and advanced battery technologies, with Li-ion batteries enjoying a second life as secondary storage systems. However, challenges remain, most notably the scarcity of rare earth materials essential for EV technology. The study's policy recommendations advocate for a swift shift towards clean energy sources in both EV production and usage, substantial investments in advanced battery technology, and robust support for recycling initiatives. Addressing the rare earth material shortage is paramount to the sustained growth and viability of EVs, facilitating a greener and more sustainable future in the realm of transportation.

AB  - BackgroundBurn injury is associated with significant mortality and disability. Resilient and responsive health systems are needed for optimal response and care for people who sustain burn injuries. However, the extent of health systems research (HSR) in burn care is unknown. This review aimed to systematically map the global HSR related to burn care. MethodsAn evidence gap map (EGM) was developed based on the World Health Organization health systems framework. All major medical, health and injury databases were searched. A standard method was used to develop the EGM. ResultsA total of 6586 articles were screened, and the full text of 206 articles was reviewed, of which 106 met the inclusion criteria. Most included studies were cross-sectional (61%) and were conducted in hospitals (71%) with patients (48%) or healthcare providers (29%) as participants. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, while only 13% were conducted in low-and middle-income countries, accounting for 60% of burns mortality burden globally. The most common health systems areas of focus were service delivery (53%), health workforce (33%) and technology (19%). Studies on health policy, governance and leadership were absent, and there were only 14 qualitative studies. ConclusionsMajor evidence gaps exist for an integrated health systems response to burns care. There is an inequity between the burden of burn injuries and HSR. Strengthening research capacity will facilitate evidence-informed health systems and policy reforms to sustainably improve access to affordable, equitable and optimal burn care and outcomes.

AB  - Micronutrient deficiency is a major problem affecting many people in developing countries who solely depend on maize as their single source of calories. Vitamin A deficiency is one of the health problems associated with micronutrient deficiency. It is caused by insufficient intake of food rich in vitamin A among vulnerable groups leading to impaired growth, reduced life span, and economic losses among resource-poor families. Strategies such as vitamin A supplementation, food fortification, and diet diversification have been adapted to combat vitamin A deficiency (VAD). However, these approaches have benefited urban dwellers leaving rural residents with deficiency sufferings, as they lack access to these alternatives. Biofortification of maize by breeding with higher provitamin A content holds immense promise as a cost-effective and sustainable approach in alleviating VAD in sub-Saharan African maize consumers. Biofortified maize has a greater potential to alleviate vitamin A deficiency in these countries. Despite the existence of biofortification programs in Africa, there is little docu-mentation on what has been conducted, challenges, and future of maize biofortification programs in Africa; this limits any strategic planning required to produce maize varieties rich in micronutrients, including vitamin A. Therefore, the present study is a detailed systematic review to highlight the past, present, and future success of provitamin A maize biofortification and its adoption challenges in sub-Sahara Africa as a strategy for combating vitamin A deficiency.

AB  - The global road network is rapidly growing associated with human economic development. This growth also entails a high toll for biodiversity, with several well-documented negative impacts on different species. However, there is still a great lack of knowledge about the effects of roads on the persistence of wildlife populations. Here, we aimed to summarize our current knowledge on this topic, based on systematic reviews. We found that only a small proportion of studies (8%) focused on the effects of roads on population persistence. Most of these studies were about large mammals and were performed in high income countries. Furthermore, these works studied only 2% of those species identified by the IUCN Red List as threatened by roads. Overall, our results show that we are far from understanding how roads affect the long-term viability of wildlife populations inhabiting road-effect zones. Addressing this challenge will require modifying our conceptual perspective, from short-term to long-term studies, from single road sections to focusing the landscape scale, and strive to obtain empirical data to support sound analyses to assess how road impacts affect the survival of wildlife populations, namely with information required to perform approaches such as population viability analyses. We highlight some key studies from our reviews that have addressed this global conservation concern with population-oriented approaches.

AB  - Background: Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder defined as pain and soreness, muscle tension, or stiffness in the lumbosacral area of the spine which does not have a specific cause. Low back pain results in high health costs and incapacity to work causing an economic burden to society. The optimal management of non-specific low back pain appears to be undecided. Recently published guidelines support the use of acupuncture for treating non-specific low back pain and it has become a popular alternative treatment modality for patients with low back pain.
   Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted through Medline using Ovid and Medical Subject Headings for randomized controlled trials published in the last 10 years. The outcomes scored were subjective pain scores and functional outcome scores.
   Results: Eighty two randomized studies were identified, of which 7 met our inclusion criteria. Three studies found a significant difference in pain scores when comparing acupuncture, or sham acupuncture, with conventional therapy or no care. Two studies demonstrated a significant difference between acupuncture treatment and no treatment or routine care at 8 weeks and 3 months. Three studies demonstrated no significant difference between acupuncture and minimal/sham acupuncture with no difference in pain relief or function over 6 to 12 months.
   Conclusions: This review provides some evidence to support acupuncture as more effective than no treatment, but no conclusions can be drawn about its effectiveness over other treatment modalities as the evidence is conflicting.

AB  - During the last several decades, the diversification of economic activities has become a paramount policy for nations and cities with heavy dependence on a single economic driver. Particularly island economies, relying mainly on tourism income, are among the most vulnerable ones to the shocks of global financial crises. In the recent years, some of these tourist islands had attempts to diversify their economic activities by moving towards a knowledge and innovation economy. This paper places one of these islandsFlorianopolis, the capital city of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarinaunder the microscope to address the question of what it takes to transform a tourist island into an innovation capital'. In order to tackle this question, the study examines economic, social, spatial, and governance conditions and performances, along with the plans and processes of Florianopolis in moving towards an internationally recognized smart innovation island. The methodologic approach includes systematic review of the literature and qualitative analysis of the key development domains of Florianopolis through the lens of knowledge-based urban development. The results of this study provide insights into how to transform a resource-based economy into a knowledge-based oneby disclosing the transition journey of Florianopolis, including progress, challenges, and the new path creation processes. The findings are particularly useful for tourist islands that are aiming for an aspiring knowledge-based urban development and smart city transformation.

AB  - The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is an iconic large carnivore that has increasingly been recognized as an apex predator with intrinsic value and a keystone species. However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human-carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the 'pre-genomic era' and the first insights of the 'genomics era'. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650-850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.

AB  - AimTreatment of perianal fistula has evolved with the introduction of new techniques and biologicals in Crohn's disease (CD). Several guidelines are available worldwide, but many recommendations are controversial or lack high-quality evidence. The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the current available national and international guidelines for perianal fistula and to analyse areas of consensus and areas of conflicting recommendations, thereby identifying topics and questions for future research.
   MethodMEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on perianal fistula. Inclusion was limited to papers in English less than 10years old. The included topics were classified as having consensus (unanimous recommendations in at least two-thirds of the guidelines) or controversy (fewer than three guidelines commenting on the topic or no consensus) between guidelines. The highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (level 3a or higher of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence 2009, ) or insufficient.
   ResultsTwelve guidelines were included and topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, consensus was present in 15 topics, whereas six topics were rated as controversial. Evidence levels varied from strong to lack of evidence.
   ConclusionEvidence on the diagnosis and treatment of perianal fistulae (cryptoglandular or related to CD) ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions wereidentified and proposed as topics for future research.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: This review documents the wide and varied repertoire of traditional practices and remedies based on the use of domestic animals in Spanish ethnoveterinary medicine (EVM) from the early 20th century to the present. Empirical practices, both ritual and magical, are recorded, and these EVM data are compared with those of other countries in the Mediterranean region and Latin America. The data collected here could form a scientific foundation for future inventories of local veterinary knowledge (LVK) and research addressing the discovery of new drugs for livestock and the validation of the effects.
   Materials and methods: A qualitative systematic review of the most important databases in the fields of ethnobiology, ethnoveterinary medicine, folklore and ethnography was performed. Information and use-reports were obtained from more than 60 documentary sources. Results: We recorded the use of nine domestic animal species and one hybrid (the mule) and a total of 171 empirical remedies based on the use of a single species. A wide diversity of body parts or derivative products were/are used. Fat was/is the most commonly used product, being used in 71 remedies (42%). These zootherapeutic resources were/are used to treat or prevent a total of 69 animal diseases or medical conditions, in particular dermatological, reproductive and digestive ailments, together with some infectious diseases. Sheep, cattle, goats and equines form the group of domestic animals in which the greatest number of useful species is employed. In addition, many remedies and practices of the magical-religious type are documented. In comparison with other culturally related areas, there is a greater parallelism in the animals and body parts and derivative products used, and the ailments treated. Conclusions: Contemporary Spanish EVM practices amass a great richness of domestic animal-based remedies. A diversity of body parts or derivative products has been used, offering a cultural heritage that could be a fundamental step in the discovery of new and low-cost drugs for treating livestock and alternative materials for pharmaceutical purposes, and it can contribute to the creation of new strategies for the conservation of natural resources and management of endangered species. The usage of zootherapeutic products derived from wild animals can be replaced by the use of products isolated from domestic animals. Finally, this overview contributes to the inventory of some uses, traditional practices and rituals seriously threatened by the progressive loss of LVK.

AB  - Agricultural intensification and landscape homogenisation are major drivers of biodiversity loss in European agricultural landscapes. Improvements require changes in farming practices, but empirical evidence on farmers' motivations underlying their on-farm biodiversity management remains fragmented. To date, there is no aggregated overview of behavioural determinants that influence European farmers' decisions to implement biodiversity-friendly farming practices. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 150 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022. We identified 108 potential determinants of farmers' behaviour, which were integrated into a multilevel framework. The results show that the farmers' decisions are complex and often non-directional processes, shaped by numerous external (at a society, landscape, community, and farm level) and internal factors. These factors are embedded in regional and cultural contexts. However, the analysis of study sites indicates that the spatial coverage of scientific evidence on biodiversity-friendly farming measures is uneven across Europe. Given the diversity of local and socio-cultural conditions, there is a need for public policies, including the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, to address more specifically determinants encouraging biodiversity-friendly farm management. This entails reflecting culture-specific perspectives and incorporating experiential knowledge into multilevel policy design processes, as well as offering regionally adapted advice on measure implementation and biodiversity impacts.

AB  - Solar home systems are being increasingly used for energy access in Africa, and claims have been made about their ability to enhance human wellbeing. Therefore, this paper systematically and critically assesses the human wellbeing effects of these systems in Africa. According to the systematic review, these small-scale renewable energy systems have positive effects in terms of education, health, safety and security, entertainment, and social connectedness. In the realms of income and firm productivity, the results were mixed, with some studies showing that the adoption of solar home systems contributed to increases in income and firm productivity, and others finding little or no evidence to support this view. However, a critical review indicates that some of the positive effects are often based on self-reporting, and rigorous evidence regarding the nature and the magnitude of the wellbeing effects of these systems is currently scarce and at times inconclusive. These systems will continue to play a role in Africa's energy landscape in the foreseeable future due to limited access to and uncertainties related to centralised grid electrification for a significant segment of the population; but, based on the weak evidence base, we are daydreaming if we think that solar home systems can improve human wellbeing in a significant way due to their low energy-generation capacity. Accordingly, future research opportunities are suggested, which could help to address some of the shortcomings in the evidence base.

AB  - Natural resources are recognized among the key determinants for the improvement of wellness, and thus the development and sustainability of health tourism destinations. This study applied a systematic review to investigate the contributions mapping and analyzing under different perspectives the value of the natural resources of a destination and related activities for health tourism. The main research topics identified from a review of 52 papers include the analysis and exploitation of natural resources in health tourism, the nature-based factors considered in clustering of tourists and their motivations, the development of value offer and marketing, as well as the cultural issues. Research gaps and future directions are summarized in a research agenda laying the foundations for the development of a multidisciplinary research stream focused on nature-based health tourism. Results also represent a key reference for managers and policy makers to identify key issues, areas of intervention and practices for industry development in the health tourism destinations through an effective and sustainable exploitation of natural resources.

AB  - Water quality impairment, due to anthropogenic activities and limited enforcement capacity, is a rapidly growing threat to water security as well as public health in developing countries. Cumulative effects of deteriorating water quality undoubtedly put pressure on public health and socio-economic developments. For example, most industries in Ethiopia discharge their effluent directly into freshwater systems without any treatment process. The problem is severe for rivers such as the Awash that pass through major cities. Although there were a few studies that looked into the issue, there is a lack of comprehensive water quality impact assessment on agriculture, health, and socio-economics. This article systematically summarizes current research on water quality issues in the Awash River Basin to generate comprehensive information that captures the water quality status of the river and impacts of water contamination, and identify information and management gaps. Results showed that water quality degradation along the river course and in selected tributaries exceeds water quality standards by the WHO and national guidelines. For example, E-coli bacteria concentration in two tributaries, Tinishu and Tiliku Akaki, reach up to 6.68 and 6.61 billion CFU 100 ml/L. Virological profile of creeks receiving wastewater from hospitals in the City of Addis Ababa contains coliphages levels reaching as high as 5.2 x 10(3) pfu/100 ml for urban rivers and up to 4.92 x 10(3) pfu/100 ml. Heavy metals that far exceed the tolerable levels for humans were also detected in vegetables produced using impaired water. Heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn were detected in potato, Zn and Hg in Cabbage, and Cr in onion and red beet. Lettuce irrigated with Akaki river water found to contain 0.263 (Cd), 420 (Fe), 13.44 (Zn), 7.87 (Cr), 7.49 (Cu), and 6.55 (Pb) in mg/kg both in excess of WHO guideline. In addition, a high concentration of Cr has been also found in fish tissues. There has never been a systematic evaluation of the impact of contaminated water in the Awash Basin. Comprehensive impact of water quality investigation that takes into account the different pollutants dynamic needs to be made to protect the well being of downstream beneficiaries including the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion the systematic review has shown that for a river that cross-through emerging mega-city like Addis Ababa, the human and ecosystem health impact of aquatic ecosystems pollution should not afterthought action

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to describe and explore the current state-of-the-art of sport mega-event knowledge management research. Methods: Following the PRISMA protocol, the authors conducted a systematic search of academic and gray literature in sport, social sciences, and humanities databases. From the initial 1,751 studies reviewed, 16 met the inclusion criteria. Findings: In these studies, knowledge management in sport mega-events was mainly researched in the context of the Olympic Games. Compared with other events, the Olympic Games built a more formal knowledge management programme, which may explain why it attracted more attention. Discussion: Most of the studies highlighted the importance of tacit knowledge and individuals, as well as the needs of different stakeholder groups. Findings showed that social, cultural, political, and historical differences between hosts weaken the effect of knowledge management. Many of the published empirical studies are descriptive investigations and lack support of related theories or conceptual frameworks. The impacts of knowledge management process on the host regions and knowledge transfer between events and local stakeholders have been little explored.

AB  - Research on sustainability was ignited by the Brundtland Report and further fueled by the recognition that sustainability is a critical challenge for the twenty-first century. The explosion of sustainability literature necessitates continuous review and synthesis. This targeted review focuses on sustainable rural land use in Latin America and the Caribbean. A systematic selection process yielded 57 articles published between 1980 and 2016. The articles were categorized based on the definition of sustainable land use, measure(s), and their contributions to sphere(s) of knowledge-environment, economic, and/or social. Almost half of the articles were categorized into one sphere of knowledge, one-fifth in two spheres, and the remaining third in all three spheres. Generally, the definitions of sustainability matched the measures of sustainability and the spheres of knowledge. This results in high variation in definitions and measures across studies depending on which sphere or combination of spheres is emphasized. Recent studies are applying complex indicators of sustainability that cross all three spheres, thereby addressing the limitations of using a reductionist approach to measure the complexity of studying of multiple intersecting and overlapping land uses. This important trend will support the comparison of current landuse practices to sustainable goals and facilitate comparison across land uses. The development and incorporation of theoretical frameworks are generally absent from these studies limiting the generalizability across study sites.

AB  - Whilst the economic costs and benefits of mega-events to host cities and countries are well documented, the evaluation and nature of the social impacts of such events are less clear. Although these social impacts typically include education and skills, destination branding, social cohesion, environmental sustainability and sport development, there is currently a lack of consensus on their measurement and focus upon both benefits and costs. In an evolved mega-event landscape which must align with political, social and cultural priorities, sports governing bodies, industry partners, residents and governments are increasingly concerned with qualitative impacts. Accordingly, through a systematic review of the existing literature, this paper assesses the current state of knowledge of the social costs and benefits of mega-events, including how they are identified, defined and measured, highlighting a need for further research to fully understand the social impacts of mega-events. To our knowledge, this is the first review to examine mega-event social impact evaluation, and we therefore provide a useful evidence-based guide to mega-event stakeholders in determining cases for host bids, event planning and related legacy evaluation. Our review culminates in a research agenda, providing practical guidance for future mega-event assessment.

AB  - The arid region in China with rich mineral resources are belongs to ecological fragile region with inadequate recovering capacity. Hundred years of continues mining of mineral resources for economic purposes, leads to the problem of land degradation caused by the spatial coupling of large-scale mining disturbance and arid fragile ecological environment. The environmental problems created by mining have not been addressed promptly, while at the same time, new problems have emerged. On the basis of our 20 years of practical experience on ecological restoration in mining areas, review and synthesis of selective literature, with interpretation and perspective, the mining situation and its ecological impacts, the factors impeding ecological restoration capability in the arid region in China were examined, the key challenges and promotion strategy were presented. The main findings of this study are as follows: Land degradation is the most prominent problem resulting in mining activities, and mainly reflected by immediate disturbance, long term effects and ecological degradation. The main challenges faced by mining area restoration in arid areas are unclear objectives of ecological restoration, lack of ecological water consumption, unreasonable selection of indigenous plants, serious land degradation and wide restoration area. Our restoration experiments in typical mining areas have proved that the microtopography reconstruction measures can increase surface roughness, redistribute limited precipitation resources (especially snow), and make soil water and nutrients carried by surface runoff and collected in valleys to regulate soil infiltration and water supply, so as to achieve water-saving and non-irrigated vegetation restoration. The ideal restoration effects are the improvement of vegetation coverage, the increase of available land resources, and the improvement of ecosystem services in mining areas.

AB  - Remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) platforms are able to optimize the process of acquiring aerial images and improve the quality of the products generated in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. The exponential advance of the use of RPAS platforms in forestry, especially from the year 2010, is noteworthy. In this review, we present the global state of the art of the development and applications of RPAS technology in forestry, structured from a systematic review. Our results reveal a trend towards the use of multirotor RPAS platforms compared with fixed-wing platforms and that sensors that register in the visible spectral range are still the most widely used. More recent research has shown applications geared especially for areas such as forest inventory, with many innovations based on the detection of individual trees. Special focus has also been given to new alternatives for pest and disease mapping and phenological phenomena that occur at short intervals, as well as the monitoring of fires and postharvest areas. Therefore, there is a great potential for the use of RPAS platforms in a wide range of forest applications, whether linked to the productive sector or to the conservation of biodiversity, with great advances for spatiotemporal forest monitoring and expectations of further progress for the coming years.

KW  - Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Peru
AB  - It is necessary to understand the terms of biodiversity and ecosystem from their definition to their use and how they have transcended into technical fields to be deeply integrated into sociopolitical and cultural discussions. These terms, being linked to a region, are considered necessary for their conservation and knowledge, which is why this article sets the objective of carrying out a study on Peruvian scenarios conceived from biodiversity and activities on ecosystems. For this reason, a systematic review of the information was carried out, extracting the information from "Google Scholar" and considering a period between 2010 and 2020. From this it is concluded that an essential part of the national natural capital of Peru is its biodiversity, and historically it is the basis and support of its development. Likewise, the great diversity of Peruvian ecosystems has its foundation in the tropical location, the primordial marine currents and its intricate orography. Despite the efforts that have been carried out to date worldwide and, of course, in the country, there is an evident deterioration of the ecosystems, due to consequences derived from climate change and its impact on Peruvian biodiversity. From there, it is essential that the official institutions in charge of programming and evaluating the plans, associated with the investigations on the biodiversity of Peru, focus on it. With this panorama, the Peruvian scenarios are looked at from the perspective of biodiversity and activities on ecosystems.

AB  - Biological indicators of soil quality express the capacity of a soil to maintain its ecosystem functions and services between socio-ecosystem inflection thresholds; therefore, they are determinants in management and land use decisions. However, their development until a few decades ago was limited for several reasons: reductionism and early development of other dimensions, such as physical and chemical indicators or their methodological complexity, thus affecting the importance given to biological factors and the integral evaluation of soil quality or health. Thus, this review presents a mapping of the scientific contributions of the last 50 years oriented to the theoretical and methodological development of biological indicators of soil quality, identifying their development and application in these decades. We conducted a bibliometric analysis that allowed us to present an overview of the field with respect to scientific production: temporality, geographical origin, institutional origin, journals that promote the development of the field, articles with greater influence by citation in the field of study, and the co-occurrences of these indicators in research. This analysis was complemented at the second stage by a systematic review of the literature with the greatest impact by citation. We found 2320 scientific papers distributed mainly in the United States (17.8%), China (12.2%), Brazil (8.3%), India (6.3%), and European Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, France, and Italy (14.2%). Our review showed 25 biological indicators with the highest occurrence; for example, microbial biomass (118), enzymatic activity (90), and organic matter (78); other indicators, such as earthworms, nematodes, or springtails, are also reported. All indicators showed relationships, to a greater or lesser extent, with soil biodiversity and its functions in the landscape. Important advances in soil indicators have developed gradually in the last few decades, with scientific efforts mainly concentrated in developed and emerging countries. In the last decade, the production curve continues with a growth trend., and research questions in the field revolve around the linkage of diversity and function from a molecular point of view. The scope goes beyond productivity, manifesting the real need to conserve and manage the ecosystem services of a limited and non-renewable natural resource. Pioneering research should begin to report on the scope of soil biological monitoring and its influence on policy, management, and land use. Finally, the promotion of research networks with developing countries can foster the development of regional and local soil monitoring policies in these regions.

AB  - The efficient deployment of resources in home-based care is considered crucial for the sustainability of health and social care systems worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify and review operational research approaches to support decision-making in home health care. We identified a set of linked decisions at different planning levels (strategic, tactical, operational) and conducted a systematic review of operational research approaches used to address these decisions. We also sampled OR literature applied to analogous decisions in other settings. The 77 papers selected focused predominantly on solutions for staff-to-patient allocation, visit scheduling and staff routing, few of which were adopted by organisations. Few studies dealt with tactical decisions of team size and composition or strategic decisions of districting, and we found no studies on contract design for commissioning home health care, on staff role definitions or on reassessment of patient need. Integrative work is scarce and the aspects of system performance considered are variable and diverse. For these reasons the literature does not provide guidance for home health care services aspiring to effective and coherent decisions across planning levels. OR approaches from other areas of application provide some insights for future research aimed at addressing this shortfall.

AB  - A full understanding of the concept of landscape plays a paramount role in sustainable management of natural resources and an increase of landscape studies. However, little is known about the concept of landscape, landscape research and its application in Ethiopia. Hence, the overall objective of this paper is to explore the concept of landscape and review available literatures on landscape research in Ethiopia and to identify research gaps. A questionnaire (n=30) was administered to explore the concept of landscape. A systematic review of available studies on landscape and related concepts has also been made. Out of the 398 papers in which the terms landscape' and Ethiopia' appeared in the title, keywords or abstract, 26 papers, having 10 or more keywords related to landscape research were included in this in-depth review. An exploratory study of art and media has been made to examine the perception of artists on landscapes. The results of the study show that the perception of Ethiopian artists on landscape is highly associated with concept of the landscape. The findings of the survey also reveal that the meaning of the term landscape differs semantically. The findings of the review also indicate that landscape studies carried out in Ethiopia do not fully cover the holistic concept of landscape; as they mostly focus more on physical features of the landscape. Moreover, the interdisciplinary approach that integrates landscape ecology, perception and history, which is important for understanding landscapes and landscape changes, is also lacking. Generally, the concept of landscape seems to be misconceived in most studies undertaken in Ethiopia, mainly because it is interchangeably used with land use and land cover. Hence, there is a need for a better understanding of the concept of landscape and the applications of a holistic landscape approach.

AB  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) can be a valuable tourism resource for both government and local communities. However, the complex definition and the massive and fragmented nature of ICH data make it hard to review and conclude research trends and future directions of ICH tourism. In this study, 85 keywords extracted from ICH definitions are input in the Web of Science database before collecting papers indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science and Humanities. Later, a systematic literature review of 418 ICH tourism studies from 76 countries published between 2000 and 2021 were conducted based on three groups of questions. The findings mainly illustrated that: (1) Currently research in ICH tourism is mainly composed of three themes: resource planning and sustainability, the impact of tourism development, and tourist behavior and destination marketing; (2) topics related to food tourism, sacred knowledge, traditional management systems, traditional management systems, legends, and myths can achieve high impact; (3) in the last five years, scholars have reduced using the official full name of ICH in tourism studies, while the category of "social practices, rituals and festive events" has become a hot topic since 2010; (4) ecotourism, culinary tourism, festival tourism, and religious tourism are the most discussed in ICH tourism research, and they will still be intensive topics in near future; (5) future directions in ICH tourism research are resultant of three vectors: place making, technology, and environment. The results present a comprehensive picture of current popular ICH topics and predict future directions in the field of ICH tourism. The systematic review of literature can help contribute to both theoretical construction, heritage preservation, and tourism practices.

AB  - Due to the rapid increase in the use of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) worldwide, e-waste has become a critical environmental issue for many governments around the world. Several studies have pointed out that failure to adopt appropriate recycling practices for e-waste may cause environmental disasters and health concerns to humans due to the presence of hazardous materials. This warrants the need for a review of the existing processes of e-waste management. In view of the growing e-waste generation in the Asia Pacific region and the importance of e-waste management, this study critically reviews previous research on e-waste generation and management practices of major e-waste producing nations (Australia, China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia) in the Asia Pacific region, provides an overview of progress made and identifies areas for improvement. To fulfil the aims of this research, previous studies from 2005 to 2020 are collected from various databases. Accordingly, this study focuses on e-waste generation and environmental management of these countries. This study found that e-waste management practices of the selected countries need to be enhanced and recommends several best practices for effectively managing e-waste.

AB  - Educational technologies have experienced unprecedented prominence on university agendas with many institutions motivated to keep the lessons learned from the COVID-19 sparked transition with regard to online teaching. In response to this renewed interest in ensuring the longevity of educational technologies in higher education, this systematic review analysed the various organisational factors-for example, leadership, infrastructure, strategy-considered essential in the literature for the successful implementation of educational technologies. Specifically, we reviewed 1614 papers published in five prominent educational technology journals in the last decade. From this sample, we identified 47 papers that discussed organisational factors. Drawing on these studies, we constructed an organisational framework, which outlines the different organisational factors, actors and processes involved in implementing educational technologies. The identified organisational factors are structured into three main categories: (1) Leadership and Strategy, (2) Infrastructure and Resources and (3) Recognition and Motivation. Our aim was to further the scholarly understanding of the organisational layer involved in digital change as well as provide concrete recommendations for practitioners. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Previous research has stressed the importance of taking organisational factors such as infrastructure, leadership, strategy and staff commitment into account when implementing educational technologies.However, review papers have failed to systematically organise these studies to create a comprehensive understanding of the organisational factors involved in implementing educational technologies and ensuring their longevity at an institution.There is currently a high level of interest in how educational technologies can be implemented in the higher education landscape, as many institutions are facing the question of what lessons they can learn from the crisis and how they can continue on their path of digitalisation.What this paper adds This review paper addresses a gap in our scholarly understanding of the organisational layers involved in the implementation of educational technologies in higher education institutions (HEIs). This paper provides a framework on organisational factors, which influence the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. This review paper demonstrates that bottom-up and opinion leadership, support structures tailored to the need and time of faculty as well as recognition and incentives have the largest impact on a sustainable implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. Implications for practice and/or policy Universities should create structures that enable innovation and creativity by promoting bottom-up and opinion leadership as well as shared decision-making processes as they are important for the successful implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. Besides providing a reliable and suitable infrastructure, institutional support and resources in terms of technical advice and training tailored to specific needs, should be in place when planning the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. The additional workload instructors face when implementing digital teaching should be recognised and incentivised as it strengthens instructor engagement which is crucial for the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs.

AB  - The adverse impact that restaurants have on the environment has received widespread attention in the last decade from both practice and academia. The current study aims to find, catalog, and synthesize the research body addressing green issues in the restaurant industry. We utilize the systematic literature review method to identify and analyze 68 research articles addressing environmental unsustainability problems in the restaurant industry. The research profile identifies the time trends of publication, key journals, countries studied, methods used, and restaurant types discussed in these studies. The results indicate that green restaurant research has grown exponentially recently and is now past its infancy. Through a detailed qualitative content analysis, we uncover five key thematic foci: stakeholders and their roles, sources of environmental unsustainability, green initiatives adopted by restaurants to address environmental unsustainability, outcomes of adopting green practices, and various ways of measuring greening practices. Research limitations and gaps of each of the themes are presented, with potential future research questions proposed for each gap. We then summarize the results of our review in a green restaurant ecosystem research framework.

AB  - The increasing global focus on sustainability is bringing the question of the sustainability of transport systems-which are still exhibiting numerous negative effects as evidence of their unsustainability-to the fore. While sustainability is an often-discussed concept, tools to guide the practical implementation thereof are limited. This paper presents a framework for an inventory of indicators against which to measure the sustainability of transport systems. While the framework is validated for urban transport systems for increased mobility (here referenced as microtransit systems), the concept is investigated in the context of transport systems in general. A systematic review of the literature was used to develop a framework of 12 areas and 50 indicators of sustainability. Expert reviews, an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), and an Equally Weighted Average (EWA) method were employed to allocate weights to the indicators and to validate the framework for microtransit systems. The framework contributes to the literature by identifying, categorizing, and integrating concepts related to sustainability in transport systems. It is intended to aid short-term decision-making in the design of urban transport systems, to continuously monitor the long-term progress of transport systems against sustainability goals, and to guide policy development. Future work would include enhanced empirical validation of the framework in the context of other types of transport systems, beyond microtransit.

AB  - The convergence of technology and the city is commonly referred to as the 'smart city'. It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities-community, technology, policy which are linked to five desired outcomes-productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice.

AB  - Climate change is already having adverse impacts, with place- and problem-based implications due to higher temperatures, prolonged droughts, and more frequent extremes. Despite uncertainty about the full extent of future change, adaptation will be required. Adaptation pathways (APs) planning is increasingly used as a methodological approach to identify, evaluate, and sequence adaptation options over time. Pathways link critical decisions to future conditions, providing a road map to support planning in the face of uncertainty. This systematic review identifies and assesses the rapidly growing APs literature, focusing on its definition, and application in diverse contexts. Using bibliometric and thematic analysis, we highlight scholarly networks driving innovation in this area, characterise theoretical and conceptual differences in framing, and derive insights for best practice. Results show the evolution in interpretation, framing and practice; from an initial focus on managing uncertainty with technological- and engineered-based approaches, through to more participatory, policy- and decision-relevant pathways. Pathways planning has become increasingly collaborative, and is now used to address climate adaptation outcomes, within the broader context of interacting and compounding stressors. Results also highlight challenges in conceptualising and operationalizing APs, including comprehensive accounting for costs, and navigating social dynamics involved in process development. Based on these findings we propose new avenues for research, to develop methodologies to better engage with stakeholders' social, political, and economic concerns, and enhance learning for climate adapted futures.

AB  - Paper presents a systematic global review of Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudoacacia invasions focusing on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We examined the data on papers, study areas, habitat studied, topic discussed. We hypothesized that these species were studied evenly throughout their invaded ranges and, as such, indexed by international databases. We asked whether four selected species are presented evenly in publications related to their invaded ranges, and whether both selected databases cover well a content of these papers. We found 48 papers for A. negundo, 14 - for F. pennsylvanica, 83 - for A. altissima, 96 - for R. pseudoacacia. A high percentage of the studies were conducted in Central Europe and USA (for A. altissima), while Eastern Europe, Russia, Western United States were poorly represented. Most studies were conducted in forests, and focused on impacts or distribution of aliens in invaded range, and their control and management. We encountered habitat types invaded by trees, factors influencing tree invasions, consequences of invaders' impact on ecosystems, counteracting measures. We concluded that the use only Web of Science and Scopus is not sufficient to obtain the complete data about the invasion biology.

AB  - Legal protection has become essential for managing the world's surf breaks much as it has for other marine and coastal protected areas. This paper presents the first systematic review of global developments in this field. We used a keyword literature search and thematic content analysis to characterise legal protection mech-anisms that are designed for surf breaks or have been specifically applied to address surf break protection needs. They are currently found in six countries, protect over 500 surf breaks, and include examples of single-location mechanisms (e.g., Malibu in USA, Punta de Lobos in Chile) and national-level protection mechanisms addressing multiple surf breaks (e.g., New Zealand and Peru). Across all examples we identified 63 discrete themes that can be drawn upon to design and communicate protection measures and present these in a typology that highlights contributing ideas. Thematic analysis identified a major distinction between process and outcome-based requirements. More comprehensive protections can be recognised by attention to a wider range of threat classes and in the detail provided for decision support, with the two ideally working together to identify the minimum assessment requirements for development proposals. Variation in levels of protection is a key topic for consideration as is the process by which locations are identified or qualified for legal protections to apply. There is also a need to evaluate the effectiveness of provisions already in place, carrying with it the need for outcomes-based monitoring which is currently rare.

AB  - Digital interventions have emerged as a promising tool for preventing youth violence, although the evidence base supporting their effectiveness lacks a cohesive framework. The aim of this review was to consolidate existing strategies for preventing youth violence through technology, providing insights into the current landscape, emerging trends, gaps, and the effectiveness of these strategies. Several databases were searched for evaluation studies of digital interventions specifically designed for children and adolescents up to the age of 18, without imposing any restrictions on the publication dates (e.g., APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo). The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The review covered 26 studies, which included a total of 24 distinct digital interventions targeting general aggression (N = 9), bullying and/or cyberbullying (N = 11), and violence in intimate partner relationships (N = 4). These interventions, encompassing interactive games, online activities, and video training, have shown promising potential in preventing youth violence by targeting essential skills such as conflict resolution, emotion regulation, knowledge and awareness, empathy, and self-efficacy. Key areas for the improvement of digital interventions in youth violence prevention involve conducting careful evaluations, refining strategies, and considering cultural factors during intervention design. Also, efforts must be prioritized to ensure their longevity and sustained accessibility.

AB  - Agricultural systems must identify fertilization strategies in line with the principles of sustainable development and the circular economy to achieve environmentally friendly food production and to meet the fertilizer-reduction targets set by some territories, such as the European Union (EU). The objective of this work was to identify the multifunctionality and cost-effectiveness in the use of the biodisinfection technique in greenhouse horticultural crops. For this purpose, a cost comparison of the different cultivation strategies was conducted, based on a systematic review of the existing literature. The results of this work suggest that the biodisinfection of soil containing agricultural biomass serves as a fertilization strategy that allows a reduction in a large part of inorganic fertilizers in protected horticultural crops of intensive nature, in addition to mitigating the expression of soil pathogens. Reducing the use of fertilizers and phytosanitary products, management fees, and important means of production, such as water, allows a reduction of up 6.1% in production costs. The biodisinfection technique is a methodology that can promote circularity in farms while favoring the use of waste, such as agricultural biomass, which can damage the environment when not properly treated.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that lack of facilities, equipment, and expertise in district hospitals across many low- and middle-income countries constitutes a major barrier to accessing surgical care. However, what is less clear, is the extent to which people perceive barriers when trying to access surgical care.
   PubMed and EMBASE were searched using key words ("access" and "surgery," "barrier" and "surgery," "barrier" and "access"), MeSH headings ("health services availability," "developing countries," "rural population"), and the subject heading "health care access." Articles were included if they were qualitative and applied to illnesses where the treatment is primarily surgical.
   Key barriers included difficulty accessing surgical services due to distance, poor roads, and lack of suitable transport; lack of local resources and expertise; direct and indirect costs related to surgical care; and fear of undergoing surgery and anesthesia.
   The significance of cultural, financial, and structural barriers pertinent to surgery and their role in wider health care issues are discussed. Immediate action to improve financial and geographic accessibility along with investment in district hospitals is likely to make a significant impact on overcoming access and barrier issues. Further research is needed to identify issues that need to be addressed to close the gap between the care needed and that provided.

AB  - Network analysis is a useful tool to analyse the interactions and structure of graphs that represent the relationships among entities, such as sectors within an urban system. Connecting entities in this way is vital in understanding the complexity of the modern world, and how to navigate these complexities during an event. However, the field of network analysis has grown rapidly since the 1970s to produce a vast array of available metrics that describe different graph properties. This diversity allows network analysis to be applied across myriad research domains and contexts, however widespread applications have produced polysemic metrics. Challenges arise in identifying which method of network analysis to adopt, which metrics to choose, and how many are suitable. This paper undertakes a structured review of literature to provide clarity on raison d'etre behind metric selection and suggests a way forward for applied network analysis. It is essential that future studies explicitly report the rationale behind metric choice and describe how the mathematics relates to target concepts and themes. An exploratory metric analysis is an important step in identifying the most important metrics and understanding redundant ones. Finally, where applicable, one should select an optimal number of metrics that describe the network both locally and globally, so as to understand the interactions and structure as holistically as possible.

AB  - Droughts, or severe reductions of water flow, are expected to become more frequent and intense in rivers in many regions under the ongoing climate change scenario. It is therefore important to understand stream ecosystem functioning under drought conditions. We performed a meta-analysis of studies addressing drought effects on litter decomposition in streams (50 studies contributing 261 effect sizes) to quantify overall drought effects on this key ecosystem process and to identify the main moderators controlling these effects. Drought reduced litter decomposition by 43% overall, which can impact energy and matter fluxes along heterotrophic food webs. The magnitude of drought effects on litter decomposition depended on the type of drought (natural drought > human-induced drought), type of decomposer community (microbes + macroinvertebrates > microbes) under natural drought, climate (warm and humid > temperate and Mediterranean) under human-induced drought, and on litter identity. The magnitude of drought effects on litter decomposition also increased with the severity of the drought. The effects of ongoing climate change will likely be strongest in streams with abundant shredders undergoing natural drought, especially if the streams become temporary. The composition of the riparian vegetation may modulate the magnitude of drought effects on litter decomposition, which may have management applications.

AB  - Research on sustainability or sustainable development has emerged significantly over the past two decades, evidenced by an increasing interest and publication momentum by academic scholars. Given the importance of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), that constitute similar to 99% of all firms, this paper adopts a three-stage systematic review protocol to present a state of art literature review on sustainable development in SMEs. Four different analysis-synthesis approaches (bibliometric analysis, methodological analysis, qualitative content analysis, and logical reasoning of authors) were used on the literature data of 117 relevant papers (from 37 journals) identified from mainstream academic databases. This review provides insights not previously fully captured or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. The findings provide several implications on the current state of literature on sustainable development in SMEs, leading to research gaps and directions for future research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simultaneous environmental changes challenge biodiversity persistence and human wellbeing. The science and practice of restoration ecology, in collaboration with other disciplines, can contribute to overcoming these challenges. This endeavor requires a solid conceptual foundation based in empirical research which confronts, tests and influences theoretical developments. We review conceptual developments in restoration ecology over the last 30 years. We frame our review in the context of changing restoration goals which reflect increased societal awareness of the scale of environmental degradation and the recognition that inter-disciplinary approaches are needed to tackle environmental problems. Restoration ecology now encompasses facilitative interactions and network dynamics, trophic cascades, and above- and below ground linkages. It operates in a non-equilibrium, alternative states framework, at the landscape scale, and in response to changing environmental, economic and social conditions. Progress has been marked by conceptual advances in the fields of trait-environment relationships, community assembly, and understanding the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Conceptual and practical advances have been enhanced by applying evolving technologies, including treatments to increase seed germination and overcome recruitment bottlenecks, high throughput DNA sequencing to elucidate soil community structure and function, and advances in satellite technology and GPS tracking to monitor habitat use. The synthesis of these technologies with systematic reviews of context dependencies in restoration success, model based analyses and consideration of complex socio-ecological systems will allow generalizations to inform evidence based interventions. Ongoing challenges include setting realistic, socially acceptable goals for restoration under changing environmental conditions, and prioritizing actions in an increasingly space-competitive world. Ethical questions also surround the use of genetically modified material, translocations, taxon substitutions, and de-extinction, in restoration ecology. Addressing these issues, as the Ecological Society of America looks to its next century, will require current and future generations of researchers and practitioners, including economists, engineers, philosophers, landscape architects, social scientists and restoration ecologists, to work together with communities and governments to rise to the environmental challenges of the coming decades.

AB  - Municipal water and wastewater services have complicated sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and quantifying their roles is critical for tackling global environmental challenges. In this study we provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art on GHG emission characterizations of China's urban water infrastructure with the aim of shedding light on global implications for sustainable development. We started by synthesizing a framework on GHG emissions associated with water and wastewater infrastructure. Then we analyzed the different sources of GHG emissions in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. In drinking water services, electricity consumption is the largest source of GHG emissions. A particular concern in China is the common use of secondary pumping for high-rise buildings. Optimized pressure management with an efficient pumping system should be prioritized. In wastewater services, non-CO2 emissions such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are substantial, but vary greatly depending on regional and technological differences. Further research directions may include GHG inventory development for urban water systems at the plant level, quantifications of GHG emissions from sewer systems, emission reduction measures via water reclamation, renewable energy recovery, energy efficiency improvement, cost-benefit analyses, and characterizations of Scope 3 emissions.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to stress the importance of practical wisdom (phronesis) for the knowledge management field. It is a relevant intellectual and ethical resource for responding to recent changes in the business environment and for responsibly and sustainably aligning organizations for the future. Organizations must find ways to reconcile social, environmental and economic goals and meet different and conflicting stakeholder needs. To this end, the authors challenge knowledge management researchers to feature practical wisdom as an enabler for responsible knowledge management built on solid ethical foundations. Design/methodology/approach The authors introduce the concept of phronesis, reaching from Aristotle's The Nicomachean Ethics to Nonaka and Takeuchi's The Wise Company. Based on a systematic review of the literature, the authors performed a bibliometric analysis. Moreover, the authors discuss the findings and offer avenues for future research. Findings The results provide an overview of the research on phronesis in the knowledge management field. It points out the leading articles and journals (e.g. Journal of Business Ethics and Journal of Knowledge Management). Likewise, it identifies thematic areas, i.e. knowledge management field, knowledge dynamics, organizational wisdom, leadership and followership, corporate social responsibility and red flags. Originality/value In this essay, the authors advise practical wisdom as a promising candidate for advancing the field of knowledge management towards responsible knowledge management. To pursue this, the authors propose to address instability and continuous change through practical wisdom and outline a research agenda to guide further research.

AB  - As cities expand to accommodate a growing human population, their impacts to natural ecosystems and the wildlife residing within them increase. Some animals that persist in urban environments demonstrate behaviors distinct from their non-urban counterparts. These potential behavioral changes are the subject of a growing body of research in the areas of wildlife ecology, biology, and conservation. In spite of increasing urban wildlife research, studies focused specifically on changing behavior in urban mammals is limited. We conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize current research on behavior changes in wild urban mammals. We included 83 papers published between 1987 and March 2020. Omnivores were the leading subject of study, closely followed by carnivores and the specific behaviors most widely studied were home range and vigilance. Among the reviewed studies, there were 166 observations of 44 distinct behaviors with 155 occurrences of behavior change relative to conspecifics in non-urban areas. The most commonly studied and observed type of behavior change was alert behavior. Results indicate urban environments drive adaptive responses in behavior including changes in home range and diet preference, shifts in activity budget and vigilance, decreased flight initiation distance, and increased nocturnal activity. Some urban mammal species even demonstrated the ability to modulate behaviors based on environmental cues. Our results highlight the need for long-term wildlife behavior studies across a variety of urban settings to promote successful urban wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Despite being a significant issue, there has been a lack of systematic reviews on gambling and problem gambling (PG) among the Chinese. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this theoretical gap. A literature search of social sciences databases (from 1840 to now)yielded 25 articles with a total sample of 12,848 Chinese community participants and 3397 clinical participants. The major findings were: (1) Social gambling is widespread among Chinese communities as it is a preferred form of entertainment. (2) Prevalence estimates for PG have increased over the years and currently ranged from 2.5% to 4.0%.(3) Chinese problem gamblers consistently have difficulty admitting their issue and seeking professional help for fear of losing respect. (4) Theories, assessments, and interventions developed in the West are currently used to explain and treat PG among the Chinese. There is an urgent need for theory-based interventions specifically tailored for Chinese problem gamblers. (5) Cultural differences exist in patterns of gambling when compared with Western samples; however, evidence is inconsistent Methodological considerations in this area of research are highlighted and suggestions for further investigation are also included. (6) Much of gambling research has focused on identifying risk factors and at-risk individuals. It is essential to balance this knowledge with a focus on fundamental character strengths, which act as protective factors and motivate one to refrain from gambling. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Scholarly peer review relies on rigorous yet fair assessments of articles by qualified referees in a timely manner. We considered the extent to which a prolonged peer-review process can delay the dissemination of results in a conservation context by combining insight from a survey with our own perspectives. A survey of authors who published peer-reviewed articles in biodiversity and conservation in 2012 and 2013 yielded 461 responses from participants in 119 countries. Approximately 44% of respondents thought that slow review times might hamper conservation, while only similar to 5% provided specific examples of how slow reviews had actually impeded conservation actions or policy formation. When queried about the value of expediting the review process for studies of high policy or conservation relevance, ca. 1/3 of respondents thought it was a worthwhile idea in principle, though mechanics of implementing such practices are unclear. Author self-identification of potentially important papers could lead to requesting a rapid review provided that a paper meets certain criteria-an approach already used by some generalist journals. Given the urgency of many conservation-oriented initiatives, we encourage the entire editor ial team (staff, editors, referees, authors) to make a concerted effort towards improving the speed of the peer-review process while maintaining quality. Such efforts would reflect the notion that timeliness is a key component of scientific relevance to practitioners and policy makers in a crisis discipline. We conclude that there is a 'need for speed' and advocate that rapid, rigorous and thorough peer review can be accomplished and can provide collective benefits to the scientific community and global biodiversity.

AB  - In landscape planning and policy-making, environmental sounds have only negative impacts on human health. The natural sounds that promote healthy and supportive environments remain neglected. Although the sound-scape concept and approach have considered natural sounds as a resource, the related knowledge has not been employed in landscape planning yet. The purpose of this study is to advance existing state of knowledge to synthesize common preferences for soundscape resources, and then to propose an assessment method for landscape planning. We introduce a planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation framework to guide a PRISMA systematic literature review. The review includes an in-depth analysis of 74 peer-reviewed journal articles and a meta-analysis for 21 of them. We find that (1) current research has under-explored the soundscape with regard to spatiotemporal evolution, health benefits, and preferences and values; (2) in green spaces, people from different sociocultural contexts exhibit common preferences for soundscape resources. According to these, soundscape formal characters tend towards naturalness, diversity, and appropriateness; (3) exposure to natural sounds does have positive effects on human health and well-being, but the degree of the effects was varied. In addition to birdsongs and water sounds, wind-induced vegetation sounds also have high values. Based on these findings, we suggest basic natural sound scores and categorized indicators for evaluating NSES. It can be implemented in Geographic Information System to produce place-based and comparable results under uncer-tainty. The results can help landscape planners better consider the contribution of the acoustic environment to human health, well-being, and quality of life, protect the areas of high-quality soundscape resources without actual human uses, and reveal the differences between the actual provision of aesthetic values and demands for nature-based recreation.

AB  - Water resources which is formed of surface and groundwater, are considered as one of the pivotal natural resources worldwide. Since last century, the rapid population growth as well as accelerated industrialization and explosive urbanization lead to boost demand for groundwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. In fact, better management of groundwater can play crucial role in sustainable development; therefore, determining accurate location of groundwater based groundwater potential mapping is indispensable. In recent years, integration of machine learning techniques, Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are popular and effective methods employed for groundwater potential mapping. For determining the status of the integrated approach, a systematic review of 94 directly relevant papers were carried out over the six previous years (2015-2020). According to the literature review, the number of studies published annually increased rapidly over time. The total study area spanned 15 countries, and 85.1% of studies focused on Iran, India, China, South Korea, and Iraq. 20 variables were found to be frequently involved in groundwater potential investigations, of which 9 factors are almost always present namely slope, lithology (geology), land use/land cover (LU/LC), drainage/river density, altitude (elevation), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from river, rainfall, and aspect. The data integration was carried random forest, support vector machine and boost regression tree among the machine learning techniques. Our study shows that for optimal results, groundwater mapping must be used as a tool to complement field work, rather than a low-cost substitute. Consequently, more study should be conducted to enhance the generalization and precision of groundwater potential map.

AB  - The study assesses the women's personal safety and security in public transport, it examines gender inclusiveness in public transport in Mekelle, Tigray. Both primary and secondary data of target women in Mekelle city have been collected in a period before the recent conflict began. Multi-stage stratified cluster sampling was used as sampling technique strategy to draw representative target women. Mixed research method was also instrumented; exploratory and confirmatory data analysis for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data was utilized to obtain the findings, and extract evidences from the data. Besides, a systematic review was used to strengthen the analysis. The findings of the research revealed that Mini-bus taxi is found the most preferred mode of transport due to its accessibility across the city. Public transport service provision in the city remains to be largely gender insensitive. Women's safety and security is often compromised due mainly to cultural norms and values that reflect in their daily trips. Harassments in the form of verbal and psychological abuse become rampant especially inside Mini-bus taxi. The result further shows that women have been harassed while waiting for means of transportation and while walking in the streets to catch public transport vehicles. Despite the modest progress on legal protection, harassment against women and girls is still widespread. Harassments in the urban public transport sector can be deterred through ethical training and awareness creation and strict rule enforcement mechanisms.

AB  - yThe Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) model has been seen as a potential solution to solve various problems related to forest degradation and the creation of inclusive forest governance. However, in practice, CBFM does not always implement smoothly, with some studies highlighting the weaknesses of CBFM in term of accountability, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, empowerment, monitoring, law enforcement, and dependency on external actors. Accordingly, this paper revisits the concept of CBFM from the perspective of New Institutional Economics and the proper governance concept. The data collection process was conducted through literature studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) methodology. It may be argued that the implementation of CBFM has weaknesses in terms of, amongst other things, business and organizational activities, inclusivity, community empowerment, community income, and sustainability. In reference to the various flaws encountered in the implementation of CBFM, and to put in place proper governance in forest business activities, this paper proposes a new model - the so-called Community-Government and Private Partnership model (CGPP). This developed model has positioned the cooperative as "core institutions" whose role is to orchestrate five main governance functions, namely: organizational, business activities, human resource development, and corporate and environmental sustainability. This CGPP model is expected to contribute to the existing literature of institutional analysis and forest management with a different approach, as well providing concrete recommendations for the implementation of the CGPP model in CBFM.

AB  - Climate change adaptation research is dominated by in-depth, qualitative, single- or small-n case studies that have resulted in rich and in-depth understanding on adaptation processes and decision making in specific locations. Recently, the number of comparative adaptation policy cases has increased, focusing on examining, describing, and/or explaining how countries, regions, and vulnerable groups are adapting across a larger sample of contexts and over time. There are, however, critical empirical, conceptual and methodological choices and challenges for comparative adaptation research. This article systematically captures and assesses the current state of larger-n (n 20 cases) comparative adaptation policy literature. We systematically analyze 72 peer-reviewed articles to identify the key choices and challenges authors face when conducting their research. We find among others that almost all studies use nonprobability sampling methods, few existing comparative adaptation datasets exist, most studies use easy accessible data which might not be most appropriate for the research question, many struggle to disentangle rhetoric from reality in adaptation, and very few studies engage in critical reflection of their conceptual, data and methodological choices and the implications for their findings. We conclude that efforts to increase data availability and use of more rigorous methodologies are necessary to advance comparative adaptation research.

AB  - This paper aims to gain insights into how heritage destinations have adopted innovative technologies (e.g., AI, immersive technology, 3D technology, big data) into their daily operations, and to reveal future research directions that can guide technology studies in the heritage tourism domain. Innovative technologies are crucial for heritage tourism management and marketing as they provide interactive experiences for visitors, improve efficient management of resources, and enhance effective communication among all stakeholders, resulting in increased engagement and sustainability for the heritage tourism industry. To achieve this objective, we propose a conceptual framework for Technology-Destination Interaction. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, resulting in the selection of 111 articles being analyzed and discussed, drawing on the framework. Based on the results, this study proposes seven future research directions that include, but are not limited to, the latest technologies (e.g., ChatGPT, Metaverse, Geo AI) and potential challenges in technology adoption (e.g., tourism leakage, technology waste, or ethnical concerns). Thirty research questions were developed for future studies. The paper contributes to both researchers and practitioners who are interested in investigating the impact of innovative technologies on heritage tourism.

AB  - This research investigates the occurrence of Pinna nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Mediterranean Sea, where it is an endemic and the largest bivalve species. Such a species is protected under the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC since 1992, being exposed to anthropogenic impacts. The distribution of this species has been known, in the past, only from reports in scientific literature. Presently, the concerns, threats and risks for P. nobilis are increasing and a more detailed mapping of the actual distribution from a largest to a local spatial scale is essential for the implementation of monitoring, management and conservation actions. Here we provide a systematic review on the occurrence of P. nobilis, employing and combining different sources of information, such as scientific and grey literature, NATURA 2000 geodata and citizen science records. The methodological approach is a pilot test based on a scaling down of the geographical area of study, from the whole of the Mediterranean Sea to the Italian and Apulian coastline (South-East Italy); accordingly, the above mentioned sources of data have been gradually included. The results show that the combination of multiple sources of information provide a more exact determination of the species distribution at a local scale, identifying sites where in-depth actions are required to ensure the species conservation and restoration. Also, the IUCN has recently underlined that the conservation of P. nobilis has become a difficult challenge, so that each of the spatial scales for the investigation is crucial to enable a better preservation and conservation of the species in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Cities globally are grappling with the negative externalities of car travel and are therefore striving to move towards a more sustainable urban transportation system. The introduction and popularity of new personal transport modes, such as e-scooters and electric bicycles, could potentially accelerate this transition as they become more commonplace and are accepted into regulatory frameworks. The integration of these new modes and vehicles into public transport systems, for example, could enhance accessibility and lead to potential modal shifts away from private car use. In order to assess the potential for change that micromobility holds, it is key to study these new modes in the context of access and egress trips to and from public transport.
   This paper presents an extensive systematic literature review of studies that focus specifically on the integration of micromobility and public transport systems and is, to the knowledge of the authors, the first review focusing on this specific aspect of micromobility. This paper offers an understanding of how this topic has been studied to date, which factors and aspects have been considered and analysed, which causalities have been identified in the research, in addition to identifying gaps in the literature and providing guidance for future research on this topic. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive collection and critical discussion of suggestions and recommendations included in the literature which are analysed in this study, aimed at improving and further promoting the effective integration of micromobility and public transport services.

AB  - Edible insects have emerged in the past decade as a sustainable alternative to agro-industrial production systems and livestock-based diets. Despite the expansion of the market and increases in academic publications, a review of the rapidly changing field of edible insect research has yet to be published. Here we present a comprehensive and systematic review of the research on edible insect industrialization, the mass rearing of insects for human consumption, published in the year 2018. Our review provides an overview of the edible insect industry, as the field becomes more industrialized, and research addresses health, safety, and other concerns of consumers and legislators. This review provides an understanding of the scales of edible insect industrialization from (a) the microbiological level of insect rearing, to (b) the external production factors within rearing facilities, (c) the development of insect products, (d) consumer acceptance of industrially reared insects, and (e) social and moral concerns with the industry. We contextualize reviewed works in relation to earlier and subsequent publications on edible insects, providing a view of the bigger picture as insect-based products are poised to become more widely available to global consumers. Overall, this review provides an overview of the edible insect industry for environmental researchers and policymakers interested in the linkages between food, agriculture, and climate change, as well as recent progress, remaining challenges, and trade-offs of an industry with potential to contribute to more sustainable diets.

AB  - Event business is constantly growing in frequency and size, attracting people from nearby areas and different countries as well. Transportation plays a key role in a successful event, especially for major ones, where the large number of participants requires ad hoc designing of event mobility and might include implementation of new infrastructures. In recent decades, environmental issues have emphasized event negative externalities, leading to the design of green events. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review on studies investigating the sustainable practices related to event mobility. The methodology showcases a selection of 32 articles, which were classified according to their main contributions into five categories, for which gaps and trends were shown. Our findings indicate that there are not enough studies to draw conclusions about good practices that can be generalized to each kind of event. Additionally, strong limitations in the reviewed papers are the different contexts of the analysis and the lack of a validation through empirical data. The research presented in this paper adds a contribution to the sustainable event transportation literature reporting the most established models, methods, and interventions. In detail, the most promising interventions involve mass transit and demand-oriented services that rely on intelligent transportation systems and user information.

AB  - The industrial energy matrix in several countries is formed by several primary sources, such as fossil fuels. However, the advancement of technologies, equipment and industrial machinery results in growing demand for environmental and energy impacts, resulting in the demand for clean energy sources. This study aims to analyze applications and the environmental, economic and social impacts of photovoltaic solar energy in the industrial sector. The methodology used was based on the application of Methodi Ordinatio, with the databases Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science, resulting in the complete analysis of 21 articles without time frame. Among the results, we highlight the applications of clean energy in water heating for industrial restaurants and bathrooms, in the generation of electricity for equipment, and as a vehicle fuel in the internal fleet, as well as for the substitution of natural gas. From the analyzed articles, the following results were obtained: 19.7% found technical benefits for the use of clean sources of photovoltaic energy in industry; 12.8% affirm that human and economic development requires the availability of energy resources for the production of renewable electric energy close to the end customer, minimizing losses in distribution lines; and 67.5% the diversification of the industrial energy matrix, which demonstrates several economic, environmental and social advantages, thus reducing the dependence on fossil resources. The use of green energy sources favors the industrial sector, resulting in increased production, reduced costs and a sustainable and competitive performance.

AB  - We present a systematic review of historical, political, and epidemiologic aspects of AIDS in Brazilian children. Over 25 years, Brazil has developed different strategies to control AIDS in children. Three revisions of criteria for defining AIDS cases in children and nine national guidelines on antiretroviral therapy administration for management of HIV infection were published. These guidelines represent important progress, including aspects of HIV/AIDS surveillance, antiretroviral treatment, opportunistic conditions, prophylaxis, and laboratory testing. Brazil has significantly expanded access to free therapy with different classes of antiretroviral drugs. Initially focusing on treatment for HIV and opportunistic conditions, the scope of treatment guidelines gradually expanded to comprehensive health care for children and adolescents. From 1996 to 2008, the number of AIDS cases and deaths in children has been reduced by 67% and 65%, respectively, as a result of different strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and highly active antiretroviral therapy administration to infected children. Improved morbidity, mortality, and survival of Brazilian children with AIDS demonstrate clear benefits of adopting a policy of free and universal access to antiretroviral drugs associated with comprehensive care. However, important issues remain to be resolved, mainly concerning social, operational, and regional inequalities in coverage and quality of care, and epidemiological surveillance in different regions of the country. This broad review shows that the overall situation of pediatric AIDS in Brazil represents an incomplete process of epidemiologic and demographic transition, with the coexistence of old and new clinical and epidemiologic challenges.

AB  - Cosponsoring Associations: The European Society of Endocrinology and the Pediatric Endocrine Society. This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society.
   Objective: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity.
   Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.
   Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.
   Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.
   Conclusion: Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting; similar to 17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in themost seriously affected mature teenagers who have failed lifestyle modification, but the use of surgery requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total dailymobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy bodymass index changes, is of importance.

AB  - Coffee is one of the most important commodities globally and the Coffee Berry Borer (CBB) is its main pest, causing losses of more than half a billion dollars annually. In this systematic review, we quantify the available evidence of successful biological control in coffee agroforestry. There is a recent research trend of switching from the traditional focus on classical biological control to conservation biocontrol, considering a broad range of enemy groups inhabiting the cropping system. We found 19 papers proving CBB biocontrol success in the field and 25 studies suggesting potential biocontrol. Most papers showed effects of fungal infections, followed by papers on ant communities, parasitic Hymenoptera, birds, and nematodes. With respect to local coffee management, arboreal canopy cover providing shade as well as organic practices enhances biocontrol success. Landscape-scale studies are almost missing, although CBB predation by birds can be significant and benefits from the presence of forest patches in the surrounding landscape. Insectivorous birds successfully reduce yield losses by CBB, whereas in many other taxa there is a need for identifying economic impacts of biocontrol. In conclusion, understanding successful coffee management to reduce CBB pest pressure requires more studies on conservation biocontrol, and analyzing the relative importance of local and landscape management for fungal infections as well as for invertebrate and vertebrate predators.

AB  - The concept of Woodland Key Habitats (WKH, small-scaled presumed hotspots of biodiversity) has become an essential component of biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian and Baltic forests. There have been debates over the importance of WKHs in relation to the conservation of biodiversity in production forests. We applied a systematic review protocol and meta-analysis to summarize knowledge on comparisons of biodiversity qualities, such as dead wood and species richness, between WKHs and production forests in relevant countries. We also summarized the knowledge on the impact of edge effects by comparing WKHs surrounded by production forests to WKHs surrounded by clear cuts. Studies had been conducted in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on our meta-analysis, WKHs seem to be relative hotspots for dead wood volume, diversity of dead wood, number of species and number of red-listed species. There were some differences also between countries in these biodiversity qualities. Only two studies compared WKHs surrounded by production forests and clear cuts, respectively. Hence, the capability of WKHs to maintain their original species composition and support species persistence over time remains to be addressed, as well as their role in relation to other conservation tools.

AB  - Discussion around anthropogenic climate change has occurred for over 100 years. However, in recent decades, these discussions have intensified due to increased confidence in scientific research highlighting adverse effects, increased knowledge breadth in climate science, and heightened public and political awareness and engagement on the topic. Climate change is now acknowledged as one of the biggest challenges and threats to modern lifestyles. Nature-based solutions (NBS), as a mediator and mitigator to adverse climate change effects, is an emerging area of expanding research collateral and practitioner literacy. To highlight current NBS knowledge, existing knowledge gaps, and research trends, a Quantitative Systematic Literature Review (QSLR) was undertaken (n = 54). This QSLR reveals the short temporal span of articles relating to NBS as a response to climate change, with most articles being of a research style format. NBS research focus areas were found to be dominated by ecological and infrastructure approaches to climate change mitigation, and ecological and technical positions were found to be most topical across the current climate change literature. Multiple knowledge gaps were identified by the review, namely the lack of broader conceptual approaches and knowledge acquisition regarding climate change responses via NBS, as well as the psychological relationship humans share with NBS and climate change, adverse or otherwise. These knowledge gaps highlight where future research inquiry may be directed to increase the value and completion of this research area. It is hoped that this QSLR will assist in increasing the profile of NBS in the multidisciplinary and complex response to anthropogenic climate change, as well as contribute to the growth in investment and implementation of NBS assets for a rigid and resilient global future.

AB  - (1) Background: Green and open spaces are conducive to physical activity for the elderly. However, it is unclear how different landscape characteristics relate to the physical activity of the elderly. (2) Methods: following the PRISMA method, this study reviewed the existing literature on the landscape characteristics correlated with the elderly's physical activity (PA) from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We conducted a systematic full-text review of 25 eligible reports and studies related to the linkage between the characteristics of green and open spaces and the elderly's physical activity (PA); (3) Results: Nature/greenery, safety, road/path conditions, aesthetics, PA facilities, accessibility, amenity, water, and elderly accessibility facilities were found to be positively associated with elderly's PA. Pavement conditions (gravel), the presence of water, poor maintenance, neighborhood aesthetics, and GVI are negatively correlated with the elderly's PA; (4) Conclusions: We close the paper by making a few recommendations for future policy-making, practice, and research. It is suggested that the landscape characteristics be applied in evidence-based policy-making and design, and in tackling health inequality. Future research should be more specific about the impact of site-scale factors, include landscape characteristics specifically needed by the elderly to conduct PA, and involve a wider scope of green and open space on top of neighborhood green and open space and parks. Additionally, these studies should take into consideration different cultural settings and geographical scales to reveal the different effects of various aspects of green and open space.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 provides a vision for the world's oceans; however, the management interventions that are needed to achieve SDG 14 remain less clear. We assessed the potential contributions of seven key area-based management tools (such as fisheries closures) to SDG 14 targets. We conducted a rapid systematic review of 177 studies and an expert opinion survey to identify evidence of the ecological, social and economic outcomes from each type of tool. We used these data to assess the level of confidence in the outcomes delivered by each tool and qualitatively scored how each tool contributes to each target. We demonstrate that a combination of tools with diverse objectives and management approaches will be necessary to achieve all of the SDG 14 targets. We highlight that some tools, including fully and partially protected areas and locally managed marine areas, may make stronger contributions to SDG 14 compared with other tools. We identified gaps in the suitability of these tools to some targets, particularly targets related to pollution and acidification, as well as evidence gaps for social and economic outcomes. Our findings provide operational guidance to support progress toward SDG 14.
   An analysis of 177 studies and expert opinions about instruments for ocean protection shows that a combination of tools is needed to achieve all of the ocean SDG targets.

AB  - Participatory Land use planning (PLUP) has recently become a significant element of planning in developing countries. Nevertheless, despite the appropriate goals, implementation still needs to be clarified in practical cases that jeopardize effective participation. Also, the formation of the necessary grounds for discussing the concept of the right to the city (RTTC) is crucial due to the significance of the rule of urban land use planning and participation to achieve citizenship rights. This qualitative research aims to provide a systematic review and a conceptual framework for the connection between RTTC and PLUP. We systematically reviewed 72 articles in English and specific documents available in Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, DOAJ, and JSTOR databases that have considered PLUP and RTTC subjects from 1968 to 2020. In this context, we have defined a step-by-step search protocol that clearly defines the process of achieving the goal. The results show these concepts have gone through three time periods together: Examination of the conceptual basis and the theoretical basis (1968-2000), Mounting different dimensions and characteristics on the previous basis and leading to more mature concepts (2000-2010), and Emergence of spatial justice in the right to the city concept, forming a suitable platform for implementing and monitoring PLUP (2010-now). Also, we classified characteristics into two thematic areas (Context & Practice) and the related sub-areas in the proposed conceptual framework.

AB  - New agricultural practices and land-use intensification in the Cerrado biome have affected the soil carbon stocks. A major part of the native vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado, a tropical savanna-like ecoregion, has been replaced by crops, which has caused changes in the soil carbon (C) stocks. To ensure the sustainability of this intensified agricultural production, actions have been taken to increase soil C stocks and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In the last two decades, new agricultural practices have been adopted in the Cerrado region, and their impact on C stocks needs to be better understood. This subject has been addressed in a systematic review of the existing data in the literature, consisting of 63 articles from the Scopus database. Our review showed that the replacement of Cerrado vegetation by crop species decreased the original soil C stocks (depth 0-30 cm) by 73%, with a peak loss of 61.14 Mg ha(-1). However, when analyzing the 0-100 cm layer, 52.4% of the C stock data were higher under cultivated areas than in native Cerrado soils, with a peak gain of 93.6 Mg ha(-1). The agricultural practices implemented in the Brazilian Cerrado make low-carbon agriculture in this biome possible.

AB  - The Amazon biome, spanning nine countries, has one of the highest rates of deforestation worldwide. This deforestation contributes to biodiversity loss, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, and damage to rural and indigenous livelihoods. Hundreds of articles have been published on the topic of deforestation across Amazonia, yet there has been no recent synthesis of deforestation drivers and deforestation-control policy effectiveness in the region. Here we undertook the first systematic review of papers published between 2000 and 2021 that have causally linked proximate and underlying drivers and policies to deforestation outcomes in Amazonia. In the 155 articles that met our inclusion criteria, we find that causal research is concentrated in Brazil, and to a lesser degree Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. There has been little study of the Guianas, Venezuela or Colombia. Large- and small-scale agriculture linked to improved market access and high agricultural prices are frequently researched underlying drivers of deforestation across the heavily researched regions. In the Guianas research focuses on mining with little focus on underlying causes. Research on infrastructure expansion, mining, and oil extraction and on technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors remains sparse. Many public and private policies have been found to be effective in controlling deforestation across the biome, with protected areas and public policies standing out as particularly successful in slowing deforestation vis-a-vis supply chain approaches. Frontier age, land tenure, and policy interactions are key moderating factors affecting the outcomes of different underlying causes and policies. Our findings indicate a greater need for research on (i) additional deforestation drivers beyond agriculture and economic factors, (ii) the complex interactions between different drivers and deforestation control policies, (iii) causes underlying deforestation in low or new deforestation areas, and (iv) the dynamics between Amazonian subregions and countries. Understanding the extent and diversity of deforestation drivers and effectiveness of existing deforestation mitigation policies across Amazonia is a necessary first step toward designing policies to further reduce deforestation in the biome.

AB  - Regional studies, particularly in rural areas, have attracted great attention from scholars and policy-makers. However, almost all existing literature focused on the growth of these areas while giving little consideration to converting economic activities or economic structural transformation, which plays the main role in sustainable development. Additionally, the studies about economic structural transformation mainly mention the factors, which are changes inside certain economic areas and ignore the outside effects while any geographical area also has spatial relationships. To fill this gap, this study blends the economic structure and regional linkages theories to supply a comprehensive view of the relationship between inside and outside factors that influence rural structural transformation by using systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The study's findings consolidate the importance of urban areas and regional linkages, especially spatial interaction, in rural economic structural transformation. More specifically, this study shows that the motivation for structural transformation of rural areas is emanated from urban areas and is transmitted through spatial flows, which are then absorbed in rural areas. The mechanisms through which the motivation affects rural economic structure are productivity, income, and agricultural land. Based on the review, the study lists several further research questions regarding empirical research of rural economic structural transformation through the relationship between rural and urban areas.

AB  - Our work analyzed Indigenous partnership arrangements and conditions associated with natural resource development, specifically, the capacities identified by Indigenous peoples needed to participate in resource wealth generation. The review was needed to take stock of previously understudied and new partnerships emerging in Canada's rapidly growing natural resource sectors where cross-cultural collaboration is becoming a feature, and in some cases a requirement, of new ventures. Results illustrate nine categories of arrangements (i.e., land use/regional planning processes; IBAs; MOUs; Indigenous businesses, joint ventures; environmental assessments; revenue sharing; advisory committees; and regional economic councils) used by Indigenous communities and their partners to assert their control and derive benefits from natural resource extraction. These included highly formal and technical legal arrangements, such as Impact and Benefit Agreements, and less formal arrangements such as Memorandums of Understandings and advisory committees. Using the five capitals' (social, human, financial, built, and natural) approach we also synthesized existing knowledge of partnership capacities and benefits. We found benefits in each of the five capital areas, most of which were forms of human capital. Employment (50%), improved decision making (46%), and also financial support (33%) were the top cited benefits. Results build to the conclusion that differences exist between capacities needed to start working together (pre-existing supporting conditions), and those built through collaboration (new or enhanced capitals as beneficial outcomes). Development models will produce more and sustainable benefits where capacity building is both an explicit process objective and outcome of new partnership designs.

AB  - The built environment plays a central role in the transition towards the circular economy as they concentrate major consumer and polluter human activities. However, the way BEs are - and need to be - driven by policy to reach cities' circular goals is still an under-researched aspect. Particularly, there is limited knowledge of policy instruments aimed to foster the transition towards a circular built environment. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature search and a review of scientific publications to characterize the relation between the circular built environment and policy instruments suggesting its implementation from a circular city development perspective. We do so by answering: (1) how many publications elaborate on CBE policy instruments, (2) what type of circular actions in relation to circular city development are mentioned, and (3) what policy instruments are proposed to implement a CBE. The literature search is performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our results show that 53% of publications address policies instruments for circular built environment transitions. Although different circular actions are identified, looping actions prevail. Adapting and ecologically-regenerating actions, which are essential for circular city development, remain insufficiently researched. Finally, among policy instruments for circular built environment implementation there is a clear tendency towards regulation as means for leverage, which calls for bigger research efforts concerning the mix of policy instruments, as well as in more general challenges in governance and policy coherence.

AB  - Development of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic is one of the priority tasks for the economy of the Russian Federation; however, such projects are associated with significant risks for the environment of nearby regions. Large-scale development of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic should be based on the principles of sustainable development, which imply a balance between socio-economic benefits and environmental risks. The purpose of this study is to analyze the gaps in scientific knowledge on the issues of assessing sustainability of Arctic oil and gas projects (OGPs) and systematize the key problematic elements of such assessments. The analysis was carried out in terms of four key elements that determine the feasibility of implementing Arctic OGPs in the context of sustainable development: economic efficiency, social effects, environmental safety and technological availability. The methodology for conducting bibliometric analysis, which included more than 15.227 sources from the Scopus database over the period of 2005-2020, was based on PRISMA recommendations for compiling systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methodological problems of assessing sustainability of Arctic OGPs were mapped and divided into four key sectors: consideration of factors that determine sustainability; sustainability assessment; interpretation of assessment results; sustainability management.

AB  - Rapid urban population growth in Africa has resulted in the rapid expansion of many African cities. This has important ramifications for sustainable development across the continent. However, studies systematically synthesising the emerging literature to critically comprehend the different dimensions of urban expansion in Africa, and its intersections with sustainability are lacking. We conduct a systematic review of 247 peer-reviewed papers, critically discussing the dimensions of urban expansion in Africa, using the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) model. Despite the significant variability between contexts, urban expansion occurs through a complex mix of Drivers, including urban population growth, in-migration, housing deficits, and the complex land governance systems. Urban expansion has multiple Impacts including the loss of agricultural land and natural vegetation that catalyses livelihood shifts/loss, and social transformation in expansion areas. The literature on the Responses to urban expansion is rather limited, usually focuses on policy-oriented responses, and suggests that such policy-oriented responses are rarely implemented effectively. Overall, we observe the centrality and multi-dimensional role of land (and its governance) and demographic transitions in urban expansion processes. We also identify the severe fragmentation of the relevant literature, the disproportionate focus on urban expansion's negative Impacts, and the critical lack of studies on Responses. Arguably, there is a need for more systematic, cohesive and increasingly comparative research to both understand the different dimensions of urban expansion, as well as design effective and fit-for-purpose responses to ensure that it does not compromise Africa's sustainable development.

AB  - Food waste (FW) contains many nutritional components such as proteins, lipids, fats, polysaccharides, carbo-hydrates, and metal ions, which can be reused in some processes to produce value-added products. Furthermore, FW can be converted into biogas, biohydrogen, and biodiesel, and this type of green energy can be used as an alternative to nonrenewable fuel and reduce reliance on fossil fuel sources. It has been demonstrated in many reports that at the laboratory scale production of biochemicals using FW is as good as pure carbon sources. The goal of this paper is to review approaches used globally to promote turning FW into useable products and green energy. In this context, the present review article highlights deeply in a transdisciplinary manner the sources, types, impacts, characteristics, pre-treatment strategies, and potential management of FW into value-added products. We find that FW could be upcycled into different valuable products such as eco-friendly green fuels, organic acids, bioplastics, enzymes, fertilizers, char, and single-cell protein, after the suitable pre-treatment method. The results confirmed the technical feasibility of all the reviewed transformation processes of FW. Furthermore, life cycle and techno-economic assessment studies regarding the socio-economic, environmental, and engineering aspects of FW management are discussed. The reviewed articles showed that energy recovery from FW in various forms is economically feasible.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of empirical studies on polycentric spatial structures at a regional scale in order to assess their effectiveness as prescriptive and normative models in spatial planning. The results show that very few studies have emphasised primarily the positive effects of polycentricity, while a large number have evaluated the performance of non-polycentric (monocentric) structures more positively. Our study shows that evaluating the effectiveness of polycentricity as a normative model is both theoretically and empirically challenging, and that polycentricity is still the subject of a research agenda with hypotheses that need to be tested. The findings indicate that polycentricity is not the superior model it has been frequently advertised as and that its effectiveness is significantly influenced by a range of factors relating to its political foundation, weak theoretical positioning, ambiguous conceptualisation, context dependence, and highly variable governance frameworks. The study recommends that scientific theorising of polycentricity should be aligned with close scrutiny of the relevant contexts to overcome its idealistic nature and lack of adaptability. The article cautions planners and policymakers against a sweeping promotion of polycentric development, as the implementation of this concept is not necessarily associated with fostering economic performance, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Land take is the transformation of agricultural, natural and semi-natural spaces into urban and other artificial uses. It is closely linked to urban sprawl (low-density or dispersed urban development). Land take is a major environmental challenge, especially for biodiversity conservation, as it destroys and fragments natural habitats.
   In order to assess how the scientific literature dedicated to this topic adresses the determinants of land take, we analyzed 193 scientific articles retrieved through a systematic methodology.
   We summarized the causal relationships identified between land take and different explanatory factors. Among them, population and income growth, as well as the development of transport infrastructure and automobile use, are widely studied drivers that are most often found to increase land take. Political and institutional factors are extensively mentionned in the literature, suggesting that urban sprawl is not a mere result of "market forces" but is also shaped though public policies. Weak or unadequate planning, subsidies for land consumption and automobile transportation are said to increase urban sprawl, while infrastructure pricing and subsidies for urban renewal would have the opposite effect. The institutional setting, especially administrative fragmentation, reliance on local taxes, and competition between local jurisdictions, is suspected to be a major determinant of land take. The effect of many factors however remains relatively undocumented or controversial in the reviewed literature, including widely used policy instruments.

AB  - Purpose: The definition of physical literacy (PL) needs to be explored by researchers from educational, public health, and sports organisations in Chinese culture; an adequate definition and theoretical framework of PL can then be embraced within different contexts and according to cultural influences. Methods: This meta-narrative synthesis of literature in this area included a series of planning, search, mapping, appraisal, synthesis, and recommendation phases. The literature was translated into English and circulated among international experts to seek suggestions. A total of 74 articles were included in the PL definition synthesis and 28 were included for philosophical synthesis in this study. Results: Based on three rounds of discussions, the final agreement was reached among panel members regarding the defining statements and practical and theoretical models of PL in Chinese culture. According to consensus, PL is the integration of physical, perceptual, cognitive, psychological, and behavioural capabilities, echoing with the need for an active, healthy, and fulfilling lifestyle, which involves continuous positive interactions with the environment and embodied engagement in physical activities for life. The framework addressed five domains (physical, sensory-perceptual, cognitive, psychological, and behavioural) and one important overlapping factor (dynamic environment). A further explanation was provided in the defining statement to assist in understanding the concept. Conclusion: It is suggested that the cultural interpretation and historical background of PL in Chinese discourse should be addressed and respected. The development of a specific cultural definition statement of PL in one country could provide implications for PL researchers worldwide.

AB  - Wind energy has emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, yet the impacts of wind facilities on wildlife remain unclear. Prior studies estimate between 10,000 and 573,000 fatal bird collisions with U.S. wind turbines annually; however, these studies do not differentiate between turbines with a monopole tower and those with a lattice tower, the former of which now comprise the vast majority of all U.S. wind turbines and the latter of which are largely being de-commissioned. We systematically derived an estimate of bird mortality for U.S. monopole turbines by applying inclusion criteria to compiled studies, identifying correlates of mortality, and utilizing a predictive model to estimate mortality along with uncertainty. Despite measures taken to increase analytical rigor, the studies we used may provide a non-random representation of all data; requiring industry reports to be made publicly available would improve understanding of wind energy impacts. Nonetheless, we estimate that between 140,000 and 328,000 (mean = 234,000) birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S. We found support for an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height and support for differing mortality rates among regions, with per turbine mortality lowest in the Great Plains. Evaluation of risks to birds is warranted prior to continuing a widespread shift to taller wind turbines. Regional patterns of collision risk, while not obviating the need for species-specific and local-scale assessments, may inform broad-scale decisions about wind facility siting.

AB  - Background The regular addition of plant-available nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, either as manufactured fertilisers or animal manure, to agricultural soils is needed for global food security. Increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural-urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and also capture its energetic value via biogas production. The liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. Two such promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from e.g. wastewater and thereby contribute to environmental amelioration are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, a treatment process that provides both renewable energy and plant nutrients is achieved. This review will examine the effectiveness of ecotechnologies for the recovery and reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment. Methods We will search for both academic and grey literature published after 2013. English language searches will be performed in 4 bibliographic databases, and Google Scholar, while searches in 41 specialist websites will be performed in English, Finnish, Polish and Swedish. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and abstract and full text. Included eligible studies will be subject to a critical appraisal that will assess external and internal study validity. We will extract information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis will involve narrative synthesis of each included study of sufficient validity. Quantitative synthesis (i.e. meta-analysis) may be possible in cases where a sufficient number of studies report similar types of outcomes.

AB  - Despite similarities in the leadership styles of men and women, gender segregation at the highest levels of management is still widespread in many firms. The management literature on the key areas of Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) - that is, gender equality and women's empowerment - has grown rapidly in recent years. With the launch of the SDGs in 2015 and the increasing research on their targets, it has become imperative to organise the extant literature and identify areas for future research. While previous reviews have focused on a particular SDG or the progress of overall SDGs, we make a novel attempt to analyse the research on SDG 5 from a managerial perspective using bibliometric and systematic review techniques on 1,713 research articles from the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection database. Our review sheds light on the leading authors, institutions, outlets, articles and themes. The publications have mostly been contributed since 2016, and the geographical focus of the research has been limited to USA, UK and Australia. Three main topics were identified: board diversity, financial performance and firm value; women on boards and CSR strategies; and demographic diversity of corporate boards. An integrated framework, impediments to research and future research directions are also discussed.

AB  - Although the importance of supply chain management in the construction sector has been recognized in recent years, its implementation still faces significant challenges. For the long-term evaluation of this creative sector, numerous intricate sustainability components, such as environmental, social, and financial, are necessary. The study focuses on longterm sustainability considerations in the supply chain in the construction sector. This work aims to address this information and examine sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research in the construction sector in this manner. More than 95 publications were studied from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021 using both in-depth content analysis and bibliometric methodologies. Several issues of SSCM in construction have been found including environmental, economic and social patterns which are most commonly known as the triple bottom line, typically enhanced by artificial intelligence. Many challenges were discovered including inefficiencies in the logistics system and a shortage of funding, environmental issues in demolition procedures and difficulties in applying sustainability measures due to high skill, data, and time requirements. The article offers a broad list of potentials for improving the current situation in the construction sector by using various types of supply chains such as increasing investment in energy conservation and emission reduction technologies to drive sustainable development, establishing strong green supply chain relationships, and forming a Covid-19 financial support group for small construction companies among other things. The study's findings suggested that due to the significance of long-term relationships between construction companies, suppliers and customers, smart technology could make it simpler to reach every supply chain link. After an exhaustive literature review 59 research questions were formulated for the future research. In the future, the importance of these questions could be determined using expert questionnaires and multi-criteria evaluation.

AB  - Current global temperature increases resulting from human activity threaten many ecosystems and societies, and have led to international and national policy commitments that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bioenergy crops provide one means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and two novel crops that could be used for this purpose areSida hermaphrodita(L.) Rusby andSilphium perfoliatumL. This research examined the existing scientific literature available on both crops through a systematic review. The data were collated according to the agronomy, uses, and environmental benefits of each crop. Possible challenges were associated with high initial planting costs, low yields in low rainfall areas, and forSida hermaphrodita, vulnerability toSclerotinia sclerotiorum. However, under appropriate environmental conditions, both crops were found to provide large yields over sustained periods of time with relatively low levels of management and could be used to produce large energy surpluses, either through direct combustion or biogas production. Other potential uses included fodder, fibre, and pharmaceutical uses. Environmental benefits included the potential for phytoremediation, and improvements to soil health, biodiversity, and pollination. The review also demonstrated that environmental benefits, such as pollination, soil health, and water quality benefits could be obtained from the use ofSida hermaphroditaandSilphium perfoliatumrelative to existing bioenergy crops such as maize, whilst at the same time reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production. Future research should examine the long-term implications of usingSida hermaphroditaandSilphium perfoliatumas well as improve knowledge on how to integrate them successfully within existing farming systems and supply chains.

AB  - Background: Considerations for palliative care and quality of death has significantly increased over the past 10 years in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Recent trends in ageing and increasing chronic disease burden have drawn attention to the need to pay attention to the concept of good death and related factors from the perspective of the local population.Aims: To assess the factors related to good death in the EMR. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest on 22 October 2021 for English language articles, with no time limit, using keywords "quality of death", "good death", "quality of dying", "good dying", "Middle Eastern", and countries in the Region. The quality of articles was evaluated using the Hawker criterion and based on the PRISMA guidelines. From the thematic analysis, the factors influencing good death were extracted. EndNote X8 software was used for data management.Results: The search yielded 55 articles, and 14 were included in the study, with a total of 3589 participants. Factors related to good death were classified into 2 main categories: patient preferences and end-of-life care. The former was divided into 4 groups: symptom management, psychological support, social support, and spiritual care. The second category included 2 subcategories: death control and patient autonomy, and end-of-life care.Conclusion: Although patients' beliefs about good death are personal, unique, and different, perception about good death in the EMR depends on the extent to which patients' preferences are met and end-of-life care is provided. More research on good death is recommended in the context of Islamic countries in EMR, and to empower patients and their families to better manage the dying process and create educational programmes.

AB  - Soil degradation threatens the forest sustainable productivity, particularly in afforestation system. Biochar derived from agroforestry waste or biomass can potentially improve the degraded forest soil and promote the tree growth. To expand the application of biochar for forestry productivity improvement, we here reviewed the effects and the underlying mechanisms of biochar on the degraded forest soil and tree growth. Totally 96 studies that conducted from pot to field investigations in China were summarized. The result suggested that biochar generally exerted positive effects on restoration of degraded forest soil such as that with compaction, acidification or soil erosion, which are mainly manifested by improving soil porosity, increasing pH, enhancing erosion resistance and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, biochar incorporation promoted the growth of tested trees in most cases, which effect was mainly attributing to directly supplying nutrients, improving soil physio-chemical properties, enhancing the root's nutrient absorption capacity, and enlarging the living space. In summary, current studies demonstrate that biochar has a unique potential for improving degraded forest soils and promoting tree growth. However, investigations on the underlying mechanisms and the long-term effects should be strengthened.

AB  - Selecting crops that express certain reproductive, leaf, and root traits has formed detectable, albeit diverse, crop domestication syndromes. However, scientific and informal on-farm research has primarily focused on understanding and managing linkages between only certain domestication traits and yield. There is strong evidence suggesting that functional traits can be used to hypothesize and detect trade-offs, constraints, and synergies among crop yield and other aspects of crop biology and agroecosystem function. Comparisons in the functional traits of crops vs. wild plants has emerged as a critical avenue that has helped inform a better understanding of how plant domestication has reshaped relationships among yield and traits. For instance, recent research has shown domestication has led important economic crops to express extreme functional trait values among plants globally, with potentially major implications for yield stability, nutrient acquisition strategies, and the success of ecological nutrient management. Here, we present an evidence synthesis of domestication effects on crop root functional traits, and their hypothesized impact on nutrient acquisition strategies in organic and low input agroecosystems. Drawing on global trait databases and published datasets, we show detectable shifts in root trait strategies with domestication. Relationships between domestication syndromes in root traits and nutrient acquisition strategies in low input systems underscores the need for a shift in breeding paradigms for organic agriculture. This is increasingly important given efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets of Zero Hunger via resilient agriculture practices such as ecological nutrient management and maintenance of genetic diversity.

AB  - Since industrial development and globalization of the world, fossil fuels remain a major source of energy for almost all sectors of life. Fossil fuels, without doubt, play a vital role in the development of today's world. However, there are increasing reservations about the consumption of fossil fuels due to their detrimental impact on our ecosystem. In recent decades, biodiesel has attracted much attention as a promising replacement for fossil fuel-based diesel, especially in the transportation sector. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and carbon-free fuel that can be made from any kind of vegetable oil or fat. In recent developments, numerous techniques have been developed to efficiently prepare biodiesel from oil/fats. Therefore, in this paper, we cover a new advancement in techniques used for the conversion of oil/fat to biodiesel and the role of artificial intelli-gence (AI). AI approaches help predict the effectiveness of biodiesel production techniques and optimize the process, in addition to minimizing the cost of the process. The AI-enabled biodiesel prediction methods consist of several stages, i.e., biodiesel data collection, biodiesel data preprocessing, developing, and tuning machine learning (ML) algorithm on biodiesel data, and predicting unknown biodiesel properties. Therefore, the main purpose of applying AI to the biodiesel production process is to improve the process optimization and to develop AI models for fuel properties measurements and ultimately reduce the cost of the product. Because these problems have not been addressed previously, we hope that our analysis will help future researchers identify the appropriate technique and feedstock to produce high-quality biodiesel.

AB  - The growing energy demand in the world and the concern for environmentally damaging energy sources have led to an increased interest in seeking alternative renewable energy sources, such as wind energy. Furthermore, choosing effective locations for wind power plants has become a key issue in project planning. However, prior to implementation, such projects should be confirmed as economically viable. This article is a systematic review of the literature carried out with the aim to identify the main factors that impact the economic feasibility of wind energy investments. The search was performed in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) electronic database, from which 120 papers were extracted after a selection process, and were analyzed individually. As a result of the review analysis, 23 factors that have an impact on feasibility analysis were identified and organized in five categories: location (surface roughness, turbine location), economic (investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, avoided energy cost, depreciation, land rent), political (interest rates and taxes, energy sales price, inflation, financing conditions), climatic (wind speed, air density, temperature, air pressure), and technical (turbine height, installed wind power, lifetime, efficiency, rotor diameter, operation time, number of turbine blades, construction time). These factors can directly impact the cost of capital and/or energy production, affecting the economic viability of wind farms. In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in publications about economic feasibility of wind investments. The wind investments growth has been accompanied by financial studies about this subject. This study provides insights on the main variables used in wind energy feasibility studies. The results may assist researchers and investors to identify the key parameters that are being examined in the literature, and to evaluate which ones should be considered in their study to ensure a sustainable development of power generation through the wind source.

AB  - This research provides a systematic overview regarding the Supply Chain Conflicts in Business-to-Business (B2B) relationships and defines and categorizes the main conflict areas and resolution mechanisms by conducting a content analysis. Based on the screening of 343 studies published mainly in the literature on marketing, business, management literature and other disciplines during 2010-2021, a systematic review and a content analysis were applied to find out the current situation and future research directions on this topic. In this research, within the context of descriptive analysis, sectoral-based analysis enables us to identify areas where conflicts are prevalent and where there is a need for further action. Regarding content analysis, highly fragmented synthesis presents how areas of conflicts and conflict resolution mechanisms are formed in the current B2B context. By providing a summary of the existing research direction on the subject, published in peer-reviewed international journals that publish research in English, this study contributes to the future academic work by identifying conflict sources and resolution methods to achieve better conflict management practices within the supply chains. With the findings of the research, companies can review their business practices and the underlying factors of conflict situations to improve their supply chains and gain ideas for their resolution. This research also contributes to the industrial marketing literature by providing an assembled and synthesized knowledge for scholars on supply chain conflicts with resolution mechanisms in both the social sciences and interdisciplinary management; deriving a comprehensive analysis of methods and insights addressed by researchers in the field.

AB  - As climate change intensifies, the need for large-scale transformations that reform vulnerable systems' prevailing values and development pathways is increasingly recognized. However, there is limited understanding of the factors that underlie such changes. This study sheds light on these factors by examining the case of Israel - a largely arid to semi-arid country with highly scarce natural water resources and a historical rural-agricultural ideology. Adopting an historically-informed systems perspective, I analyze two transformations that diminished Israel's vulnerability to recurring droughts: the 1960s' economic transformation from agriculture to industry, and the shift to seawater desalination in the mid-2000s. These changes are examined using causal-loop diagrams based on multiple data sources, including archival records, statistical reports and a systematic review of grey and academic literature.
   The findings show that both transformations, instigated by state institutions during exceptionally severe droughts, were driven by shifts away from development paradigms embedded in the nation-building ideology, as well as by social stresses that exceeded the natural limits of the agricultural system and water supply system. Repeated drought shocks activated and later reactivated the shift to desalination, intended to a certain degree to reduce drought vulnerability. However, drought did not significantly affect the economic transformation, initiated mainly due to saturation in agricultural development. Thus, I argue that alongside concerted adaptation efforts state institutions should dedicate greater attention to the management of broader social challenges and crises in a manner that fosters greater resilience against future climate changes. Ideological shifts and consequent restructuring of development paths, as well as the interaction between population growth and limited natural resources, may constitute important entry points. These entry points are particularly pertinent to emerging economies in other dry areas, many of which face similar social and economic trends to those experienced in Israel over the last decades.

AB  - Background/ImportanceDietary interventions, vitamins, and nutritional supplementation are playing an increasingly important role in the management of neuropathic pain. Current pharmacological treatments are poorly tolerated and ineffective in many cases.ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to study the efficacy of dietary interventions, vitamins, and nutritional supplementation in the management of chronic neuropathic pain in adults.Evidence ReviewThe review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42022300312). Ten databases and gray literature, including , MEDLINE and Web of Science, were systematically searched using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary related to chronic neuropathic pain and oral non-pharmacological supplements. Studies on adult humans published between 2000 and 2021 were considered for inclusion. The Cochrane Handbook was used to assess risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to determine overall quality of evidence.FindingsForty studies were included in the final review, and results were categorized according to pain type including pain related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN, 22 studies, including 3 prospective cohorts), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN, 13 studies, including 2 prospective), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS-I, 3 studies, including 1 prospective), and other (2 studies, both RCT). The CIPN studies used various interventions including goshajinkigan (4 studies), vitamin E (5), vitamin B12 (3), glutamine (3), N-acetyl-cysteine (2), acetyl-l-carnitine (2), guilongtonluofang (1), ninjin'yoeito (1), alpha-lipoic acid (1), l-carnosine (1), magnesium and calcium (1), crocin (1), and antioxidants (1), with some studies involving multiple interventions. All CIPN studies involved varying cancers and/or chemotherapies, advising caution for generalizability of results. Interventions for DPN included alpha-lipoic acid (5 studies), vitamin B12 (3), acetyl-l-carnitine (3), vitamin E (1), vitamin D (2), and a low-fat plant-based diet (1). Vitamin C was studied to treat CRPS-I (3 studies, including 1 prospective). Magnesium (1) and St. John's wort (1) were studied for other or mixed neuropathologies.ConclusionsBased on the review, we cannot recommend any supplement use for the management of CIPN, although further research into N-acetyl-cysteine, l-carnosine, crocin, and magnesium is warranted. Acetyl-l-carnitine was found to be likely ineffective or harmful. Alpha-lipoic acid was not found effective. Studies with goshajinkigan, vitamin B12, vitamin E, and glutamine had conflicting results regarding efficacy, with one goshajinkigan study finding it harmful. Guilongtonluofang, ninjin'yoeito, and antioxidants showed various degrees of potential effectiveness. Regarding DPN, our review supports the use of alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, and vitamin D. The early use of vitamin C prophylaxis for the development of CRPS-I also seems promising. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - This study adapted a socio-ecological framework to review Drivers of mining Activities, the environmental Pressures, the State of changes, their Impacts on human Welfare, and the management Response as Measures (DAPSI(W)R(M)) to mining activities. Systematic literature review was employed in data collection. The mining activities lead to environmental pressures, such as forest degradation, and wastewater. State changes of the environment as a result of pressures generated by mining activities were changes in land cover and habitat degradation leading to biodiversity loss, air, water and soil pollution. As a result of the state changes in the environment, the livelihood strategies of communities have been affected. Sub-Saharan African countries have implemented legal and policy framework as measures to overcome adverse effects of mining on the social systems. However, there is still a need for effective formulation and implementation of policies, legislation, plans, and strategies for the sustainable mining and rural development. These will be far-reaching in addressing application and mal-practices in mining sector such as corruption, limited meaningful participation of host communities, non-adherence to social and environmental standards, adverse incentives in inadequate local policies and accountability systems, transfer pricing, tax evasion and under-valuation of assets.

AB  - Climate change has an effect on ecosystems and people all around the globe and causes land degradation. A long-term decline in biological output, loss of ecological integrity, and a fall in the economic worth of the land are all signs of "land degradation", a downbeat trend in land condition. In the red lateritic zone of the tropical area, where "climate change" and "land degradation" are related, they impact one another. On the other hand, due to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which slow the rate of carbon absorption, and the extent of various existing land degradation processes, which are worsened in pace and magnitude by "climate change". The world's expanding population poses a challenge to supplying the rising demand for food in recent decades. The need for additional land for farming, feed, and other forms of production is fuelled by poverty and the destruction of the environment. In tropical regions, "soil erosion" caused by "water and wind, salinization and alkalinity, acidity, losses of organic carbon, nutrient imbalance, pollution/contamination by toxic substances, and soil sealing and capping" all call for immediate action to stop the land degradation process and sustainably restore productivity for environmental security and food security for the world's expanding population. After fulfilling the requirement systematic knowledge about soil, scientific use of natural resources (water, land, minerals, vegetation, air and biodiversity) will present a healthy planet with a healthy ecological system for future generations.

AB  - To improve the effectiveness and the sustainability of logistics, the Physical Internet paradigm proposes disruptive solutions. This implies developing an ecosystem of tech-based logistics solutions and supporting methodologies that enable all players in global trade to cooperate. The purpose of this paper is to investigate systematic literature review (SLR) studies to gain detailed insight into how innovative transport technologies, and digitalization initiatives around the Physical Internet development impact supply chains. This paper presents the results of a tertiary study that systematically identified more than twelve thousand articles and selects to review 74 secondary studies on the application of disruptive technologies and the Physical Internet initiative on supply chains from a management perspective. This is complementary to previous reviews, since no one provides a comprehensive and consolidated approach towards the relationship of these three fields. The five-stage systematic review process proposed by Denyer and Tranfield (2009) is followed. As a result, we identify the key activities, knowledge areas and strategies in the supply chain field where the Physical Internet and disruptive technologies interact and are game-changing. Also, we present a conceptual framework that summarises the relationships that exist between relevant disruptive technologies, the physical internet topics, and supply chain key activities. The framework is helpful for researchers and practitioners to find potential technologies to invest in, to assess the potential effects on companies of their implementation, and to support strategic decision-making. The paper concludes with an outlook on future research opportunities from operational, tactical, and strategic perspectives.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate what is known about the relative health impacts, in terms of nutrient intake and health outcomes, of diets with reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE).
   Design: We systematically reviewed the results of published studies that link GHGE of dietary patterns to nutritional content or associated consequences for health.
   Setting: We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that included data on actual and modelled diets and enabled a matched comparison of GHGE with nutrient composition and/or health outcomes.
   Subjects: Studies included used data from subjects from the general population, who had taken part in dietary surveys or prospective cohort studies.
   Results: We identified sixteen eligible studies, with data on 100 dietary patterns. We present the results as dietary links between GHGE reduction and impact on nutrients to limit (n 151), micronutrient content (n 158) and health outcomes (n 25). The results were highly heterogeneous. Across all measures of 'healthiness', 64% (n 214) of dietary links show that reduced GHGE from diets were associated with worse health indicators. However, some trends emerged. In particular, reduced saturated fat and salt are often associated with reduced GHGE in diets that are low in animal products (57/84). Yet these diets are also often high in sugar (38/55) and low in essential micronutrients (129/158).
   Conclusions: Dietary scenarios that have lower GHGE compared with average consumption patterns may not result in improvements in nutritional quality or health outcomes. Dietary recommendations for reduced GHGE must also address sugar consumption and micronutrient intake.

AB  - Mining alters the natural landscape and discharges large volumes of wastes that pose serious pollution hazards to the environment, to human health and to agriculture. As a result, the recent 2decades have witnessed a global surge in research on post-mining landscape restoration, yielding a suite of techniques including physical, chemical, biological (also known as phytoremediation) and combinations. Despite the long history of mining in Africa, no systematic review has summarized advances in restoration research and practices after mining disturbance. Thus, the aim of this review was to document the state-of-knowledge and identify gaps in restoration of post-mining landscape in Africa through literature review. We found that: (1) there has been substantial progress in identifying species suitable for phytoremediation; (2) few studies evaluated the feasibility of organic amendments to promote autochthonous colonization of mine wastelands or growth of planted species; and (3) restoration of limestone quarries in Kenya, sand mining tailings in South Africa, and gold mine wasteland in Ghana are successful cases of large-scale post-mining restoration practices in Africa. However, the pace of post-mining landscape restoration research and practice in Africa is sluggish compared to other parts of the global south. We recommend: (1) mainstreaming the restoration of mine wastelands in national research strategies and increased development planning to make the mining sector Green; (2) inventory of the number, area, and current status of abandoned mine lands; (3) expanding the pool of candidate species for phytostabilization; (4) further evaluating the phytostabilization potential of organic amendments, e.g., biochar; (5) assessing the impacts of mining on regional biodiversity.

AB  - Food waste is a global challenge that threatens the sustainable development of human societies. Although food waste is produced in all stages of the food supply chain, household food waste is the biggest contributor to the food waste fraction. In this research, we systematically reviewed 54 empirical studies to explore drivers and barriers to household food waste reduction and prevention. Key aspects, such as comprehension and perception of food waste issues, practices and lifestyles, were examined. Our findings suggest that a great understanding of the impact of one's food waste on health, environment and economy directly promotes food waste management. Additionally, the food waste issue is not attributed to a single factor, it may differ varies across countries. The majority of the reviewed literature on household food waste comes from European countries, where similar geographical, economic and cultural characteristics may lead to comparable drivers and barriers. This could be the reason for showing optimistic experience to the respective food waste management interventions. However, the applicability of these findings and interventions to regions beyond Europe are uncertain. Future studies should also be expanded to include regions such as Asia, North America, Africa, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean. To support the sustainable management of household food waste, mapping country-specific food waste determinants is crucial in developing easy-to-implement food waste interventions that can specifically address the food waste issue in each country.

AB  - With the development of the road pavement industry and increasing traffic on streets, construction materials have likewise been developed and progressively non-conventional materials have been incorporated. The main idea behind the utilization of those non-conventional materials was the shortage of natural materials and their expensive cost which have supported the inclination towards the inclusion of waste and marginal materials that has also assisted in achieving environmental sustainability in asphalt pavement design and construction. Researches have shown that there is a variety of waste materials that can be used effectively in different layers of pavement system such as oil shale ash (OSA). OSA is considered undesirable and environmentally dangerous as a byproduct of direct combustion or retorting of oil shale. However, research has recently shown that this ash has many benefits that improve the asphalt mixture. Accordingly, this paper presents a systematic review of the performance evaluation of different types of OSA modified asphalt cement and asphaltic concrete mixes, in terms of the most successful ratio to be added and the extent to which the properties of asphalt mixtures were affected by this addition. It was concluded that there is a consensus among the researchers that adding OSA to concrete mixture improved its conventional and rheological properties and reduced its potential for stripping and creep damaging, where the optimum ratio of OSA to be added was recommended to be in the range of 5-15% by the volume of binder.

AB  - Research into construction education (CE) has garnered increasing attention over the last few decades and a great number of CE studies have been published. However, few studies have mapped the global geography and perspective of that research. This paper presents the first bibliometric analysis of CE studies published between 1982 and 2017 in order to chart the academic development and identify of various research directions within the field. Focusing on development trends, knowledge body structure, major journals, and collaboration networks and applying quantitative evaluation results allowed instructive findings and implications concerning the possible deficiencies in CE research to be derived. The analysis of keyword trends indicates that new concepts like building information modeling and sustainability have recently become hot topics in CE research. The most influential articles, journals, authors, and countries/regions were also identified. The findings also imply that current CE research shows a bias toward technology utilization in education and the existence of considerable isolation between formed groups, such as collaboration networks. This study contributes to CE literature by providing useful information of its status quo and suggesting potential directions for future CE research.

AB  - The design of global supply networks has evolved from traditional lowest landed cost analysis to include more strategic concepts such as how particular network configurations might support strategic and operational capabilities. An established approach to assessing operational capabilities is the maturity model methodology where the emphasis is on notions of evolution and levels of process formality. More recently, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable supply networks, driving industrial practitioners to also address energy and resource efficiencies and waste minimisation. However, quantitative measurement approaches such as carbon footprinting beyond the firm boundary are complex and resource intensive and present significant validation challenges. This article proposes a process maturity model-based alternative to supply network carbon measurement approaches, namely, the systematic review of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing. Furthermore, the incorporation of sustainability dimensions within an established supply chain maturity model architecture provides a basis for potential trade-offs. Application of the maturity model framework in 12 case studies of international manufacturing multinationals is presented, demonstrating feasibility and utility of the approach and identifying potential drivers for manufacturing sustainability linked to the industrial supply network position, including the regulatory context, and consumer sentiment.

AB  - Drive tourism (DT) has become an attractive way to visit tourism destinations for an increasing number of visitors along driving routes. This flow of visitors has made sustainability a major issue, that is, the way by which tourism development ensure economic benefits for local communities and preserves local identity, along the route, without compromising the environmental resources. Many studies focused the topic of DT, mainly the analysis of a particular angle, either be economic sustainability, e.g., advantages of the ones related to economic and environment sustainability, such as the impact of tourists along the route environment. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the social consequences of DT in the local entrepreneurial environment and the resulting exaggeration of their cultural representativeness in the sense of authenticity. Our aim is to summon these points of view and achieve, through a systematic literature review, a clear and integrative picture of the driving tourism impacts in terms of sustainability along the routes throughout local communities. A systematic literature review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. This systematic literature review sought to consolidate knowledge on the subject. In order to illustrate the link between major categories and their corresponding trends, authors used VOSviewer scientific software. The gathering of existing knowledge around the three components of sustainability highlighted the importance of community involvement and collaboration among DT stakeholders to address the trade-off between the protection and promotion of DT routes. Opportunities for future studies are suggested.

AB  - Bees and the pollination services they deliver are beneficial to both food crop production, and for reproduction of many wild plant species. Bee decline has stimulated widespread interest in assessing hazards and risks to bees from the environment in which they live. While there is increasing knowledge on how the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in agricultural systems may impact bees, little is known about effects of other pesticides (or plant protection products; PPPs) such as herbicides and fungicides, which are used more widely than insecticides at a global scale. We adopted a systematic approach to review existing research on the potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, with the aim of identifying research approaches and determining knowledge gaps. While acknowledging that herbicide use can affect forage availability for bees, this review focussed on the potential impacts these compounds could have directly on bees themselves. We found that most studies have been carried out in Europe and the USA, and investigated effects on honeybees. Furthermore, certain effects, such as those on mortality, are well represented in the literature in comparison to others, such as sub-lethal effects. More studies have been carried out in the lab than in the field, and the impacts of oral exposure to herbicides and fungicides have been investigated more frequently than contact exposure. We suggest a number of areas for further research to improve the knowledge base on potential effects. This will allow better assessment of risks to bees from herbicides and fungicides, which is important to inform future management decisions around the sustainable use of PPPs.

AB  - Background: Psoriasis is becoming increasingly recognized as a chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Statins are generally well-tolerated drugs with pleiotropic effects including decreasing inflammation and may have the potential to reduce psoriasis severity.
   Aims: To examine whether oral statins reduce the severity of psoriatic skin disease.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and adapted for Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials and Clinical trials. gov to January 6, 2016. We primarily examined randomized controlled trials that assessed the change in PASI score over a follow-up period of at least 8 weeks, for participants with an established diagnosis of psoriasis taking an oral statin versus placebo or other active treatment. Beyond this, we also examined other interventional studies that investigated the effect of statins on psoriasis severity using other designs. We extracted efficacy and adverse event data. The two study authors examined issues of study quality and study inclusion independently.
   Results: Three studies were identified which measured the change in psoriasis severity using PASI, comparing statin with placebo or standard therapy alone in a prospective, randomized study design; these showed conflicting results. However, among the excluded studies, majority of which used a single arm, non-placebo controlled study design, most showed an improvement in PASI scores after statin use.
   Limitations: Included studies were of limited sample size and quality. They were not amenable to pooled analysis.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the paucity of high quality, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effects of statins on psoriasis severity using clinically objective measures. There is insufficient evidence that the use of oral statins as an adjunctive therapy can reduce the severity of psoriasis.

AB  - Innovation imbued in every sector in every part of the world is essential to growth and development. The National Innovation Systems (NIS) use their resources to support economies in different countries foster a novel environment. Therefore, this study is an attempt to examine the efficiency of NIS as measured by scholars in the past using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Through a systematic literature review, this study aims to show the current dearth of studies on the efficiency of NIS. The literature is categorized accordingly and provides a framework with recommendations for future research. With the advent of technical tools, DEA programming methods other than traditional DEA such as network, relational network, dynamic network, slack based model, and super efficiency DEA have emerged. This enables the calculation of innovation efficiency to be efficient and reliable. As a result, DEA is regarded as a powerful tool for assessing the relative efficiency of NIS, which employs multiple inputs to generate multiple outputs. The results also suggest that future research is needed on the efficiency of innovation by paying more attention to cross-countries studies based on regions, geographical areas, participation in free trade blocs, and a group of tie-up countries involved, especially with comparative analyses regardless of the country classification. Another important observation is that there are few studies that focus on the efficiency of middle-and low-income countries. The comparative analysis of innovation efficiency across income groups enables NIS to benchmark itself against best-in-class innovators and improve their innovation performance and ranking. These findings provide an opportunity to further investigate how NIS add value and sustainability to countries by improving resource management capabilities to improve innovation efficiency.

AB  - Leadership for the digital and entrepreneurial society is a relatively new and emerging area of study, as the rapid pace of technological change has brought new challenges and opportunities for leaders. Forasmuch as digital society continues to evolve and grow, and as COVID-19 has had a significant impact on leadership practices and has brought about some notable changes in how leaders approach their roles, new leadership models are emerging to meet the unique provocations and chances of this context. The scientific literature on this specific topic is still emerging, but some key themes have already come up emphasizing the importance of agility and adaptability as organizations have to rapidly pivot their operations in response to the increasingly necessary digital expansion accelerated by the pandemic. As traditional business models are disrupted, leaders who are able to effectively leverage new technologies while thinking creatively and taking risks are more likely to succeed. Therefore, considering that the subject is still in its early stages, the research topic is to examine the leadership models that should be utilized in order to improve the digital and entrepreneurial context answering the main research questions related to the steps and leadership practices that will make a significant difference in both digital and entrepreneurial societies. The past literature on empirical and theoretical topics is compiled via a systematic review. An analysis of the content that is qualitative and descriptive was planned. Scopus, Web of Science or Google Scholar search results were of great help in carrying out the study and various leadership models were examined. The paper's theoretical contribution is the definition of a set of rules and criteria on where to focus on leadership. The collection of data for new performance, ownership, efficiency, and business value generation indicators is promoted at all levels.

AB  - In recent years, the integration of the landscape approach with other approaches has attracted wide attention for its holistic view and new paradigms redefining the relation of man and environment. Yet there is no consensus over precise definitions for the landscape, and landscape approach to reflect their essence. The extensive theoretical literature on landscape definitions has caused ambiguities in understanding these terms and concept and made its application difficult. The purpose of this study is to explore the nature and different dimensions of the landscape approach by developing a conceptual model.
   Based on the findings of this study, from theoretical perspective, landscape is an objective phenomenon, and objective-subjective whole, or a temporal-spatial phenomenon born through the interactions between nature and culture, and hence a complex system. Also, from a practical view point, it is the landscape approach that deals with a holistic view and the applied aspect of theoretical concepts. The systematic review of previous research shows that, this approach is based on three components: conceptual nature, principles and characteristics, and management processes. Its nature is composed of physical-semantic aspects and presents an interpretation of the conceptual framework of landscape in the human-environmental system. The principles and characteristics that emerge from this nature are holistic, multifunctional, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, participatory, dynamic (ecological-social), complex, place-based, and can involve multiple stakeholders. Also, integrated, adaptive, participatory, contextual, and resilient dimensions are the main features of the landscape approach at the management level, which lead to the guidelines for their applications through two processes: planning policy-making and decision-implementation. This approach is evaluated through monitoring and controlling and evolves into a cyclical and progressive process to expand.

AB  - The design of Biosphere Reserves (BR) poses an interesting problem for systematic planning. It entails a spatially explicitly compromise between economic, social, cultural and biodiversity protection objectives, in a sustainable development context. The global network of Biosphere Reserves includes 563 sites in 110 countries. Currently the spatial configuration of BRs follows a nested scheme, where different land use regimes are assigned to zones in an ad hoc fashion, which complicates the evaluation of their effectiveness. So far in the literature, have not been designed to achieve quantitative objectives, which could limit their value for sustainable development. Using the newly developed version of the software MARXAN (c), we solve part of this problem enabling BRs to reach predefined set of spatially explicit quantitative targets, while minimizing the reserves' overall costs (i.e. opportunity, implementation, land value, etc.). Our case study is the Pantanal Biosphere Reserve (PBR), in Brazil. According to our results the PBR could substantially improve its effectiveness if a systematic review of its objectives and goals is performed. Rearrangements of all zones proved to be necessary. Core zones for example, composed of IUCN categories I to IV, increased from its current 1.5% of the BR area to 18.5% to reach all objectives. The absence of quantitative guidelines from UNESCO for the configuration of BRs has limited their effectiveness. Our quantitative systematic approach provided the first insights into potential requirements for zone partitioning, prescribing 22 +/- 5% to be allocated in core zones, 22 +/- 3% in buffer zones, and 33 +/- 4% in transition zones. The most useful outcome, however, was the flexibility the software offered to reach multiple objectives simultaneously.

AB  - The World Health Organization promotes risk assessment and risk management through Water Safety Plans (WSPs) as the most effective way to manage drinking-water supplies. Despite proven advantages of this approach in other regions, WSPs are still not widely used across small drinking-water supplies in Sub Saharan Africa. The aim of this research is to identify good practices and related gaps which may assist with formal uptake of WSPs for small drinking-water supplies in Rwanda. Through semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders involved in small drinking-water supply management across Rwanda, the aim is achieved through the investigation of the following: (i) current drinking-water management challenges; (ii) stakeholder collaboration and data management activities including reporting of information; and (iii) the regulatory and policy environment. The use and awareness of WSPs in Rwanda was confirmed as low. However certain drinking-water management activities which align with the WSP methodology are being carried out. These include catchment management and stakeholder collaboration. Although legislation and policy are in place in Rwanda, communication and training of methods to implement WSPs are required to sustainably embed WSPs into practice. Several elements, including community engagement, systematic review of risks and data management, require greater focus to align with the WSP methodology. Respondents highlighted key drinking-water management challenges, including reactive budgeting and lack of sector prioritization, which could benefit from formal WSP implementation.

AB  - An increasing body of literature has demonstrated COVID-19's harmful impact on agri-food systems, which are a major source of livelihood for millions of people worldwide. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been playing an increasing role in enhancing agri-food systems' resilience amid COVID-19. In this study, the PRISMA approach was employed to perform a systematic review of the literature from January 2020 to December 2021 on the overall impact of COVID-19 on agri-food system networks and ICT's role in enhancing agri-food system resilience in developing countries. This study reveals that COVID-19 has posed abundant obstacles to agri-food systems actors, including a lack of inputs, technical support, challenges to selling the product, transportation barriers, and low pricing. These impediments result in insufficient output, unforeseen stock, and revenue loss. COVID-19's restrictions have caused a significant food deficit by disrupting the demand and supply sides of the agri-food system networks. A high number of small-scale farmers have had to deal with food insecurity. As a result of the cumulative effects, actors in the agri-food system are getting less motivated to continue producing. This study also argues that many challenges in the agri-food systems can be overcome using ICTs, including maintaining precise farm management, product marketing, and access to production inputs. To assist stakeholders in coping with, adapting to, and building resilience in the agri-food system networks, this article emphasizes the critical need to turn to and expand the application of advanced agricultural ICTs to meet the world's growing needs for food production and to ensure the resilience and sustainability of farming systems, particularly in the face of a pandemic like COVID-19.

KW  - PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Urban planning is recognized as an interaction between the state and society, which aims to articulate public policies in the territory, facilitating their administration in favor of greater development and well-being of society. However, this interaction becomes complex because consumption demands increase, and the carrying capacity of the urban ecosystem to supply them is exceeded, hindering its sustainable functionality. With this overview, it becomes relevant to study urban planning from a sustainable environmental planning perspective, based on four topics: urban planning, sustainability, resilience, and smart cities, which are developed throughout the document by means of a chronological study. A bibliometric study was used through a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) adjustment to 87 articles, supported by VOSviewer (R), which allowed for the construction and visualization of the co-occurrence networks of key words extracted from the selected articles. Likewise, 16 documents more were used for the co-occurrence analysis. The main result is to consider cities with a complex systems approach that works like a gear; the relationship between inter-urban and intra-urban processes is the key factor that allows for an understanding of their synchronization; therefore, deepening of each of these topics is crucial to the ideal of a territorial administration involving time scales and adaptive cycles, allowing for the provision of new tools for concepts such as carrying capacity and the measurement of the ecological footprint.

AB  - Purpose:This research analyzes the current knowledge regarding the use of maturity models (MMs) in SSCM, aiming to identify the main characteristics, trends and research gaps on the subject. Facing the growing interest in carrying out studies directed at sustainability, to the detriment of more prescient environmental and social impacts and the need to consolidate the concepts present in the literature regarding the SSCM, an absence of similar studies in the current literature was found. The authors have selected articles to compose a database that allows users to analyze and classify publications on MMs in SSCM, being those subdivided into 7 categories: focus, methodology, analyzed sector, sustainable practices, dimensions of sustainable development, type of MM and model/framework validation method. Design/methodology/approach:To achieve this purpose, a literature systematization was conducted by searching publications using defined keywords in two databases and following a process of classification. The systematic process has five steps, from the selection of databases to the filtering of publications, review of information and analysis of the sample. Findings:The topic under study is promising, with a few publications dealing with it, mainly in Brazil, and there is a trend to exploit more of the area in future research. Originality/value:This research provides a detailed analysis of an emerging theme, divided into seven thematic categories. Results demonstrate that the topic is still underexplored, indicating an important research gap to be filled.

AB  - Purpose There have been several reviews of green, ecological and sustainable innovations, but a thorough assessment of green innovation (GI)'s mechanisms in a supply chain setting has not been attempted yet. The purpose of this paper is to review how GI was investigated in supply chains through the lens of a multilevel framework of innovation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach The authors provide a comprehensive assessment of prior studies using a systematic literature review approach and content analysis of 136 papers identified from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Findings Current literature on green innovation supply chains (GISC) has been categorized according to three main causal mechanisms: situational, action-formation and transformational mechanisms. Three different levels of analysis were considered for the three mechanisms: macro, meso and micro. In addition, the authors have also assessed the value creation and appropriation outcomes of GI. The authors identified relevant research gaps in the extant literature and a set of propositions that may guide future research in this area. Research limitations/implications This review provides a novel perspective on GISC based on a multilevel theoretical framework of mechanisms. Practical implications The causal mechanisms assessment of GISC can be adopted by organizations to convince their SC partners to engage in collaborative and more ambitious initiatives in the field. Social implications The findings of this review could serve as an argument for more encompassing and ambitious GISC initiatives which can be of benefit to society. Originality/value A thorough assessment of the interacting mechanisms in GISC has not been attempted before. The authors identify gaps in current literature and provide several propositions for further research avenues based on causal mechanisms framework.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - The modern industry discourse on sustainability is the idea of 'green growth', which is described as the paradox of the continuation of increased economic growth, at the same time as increasing sustainability. Policy makers face the challenge of how to encourage and sustain appropriate levels of individual behavioural change to manage consumption in a changing environment. In addressing this challenge, this study seeks to move beyond discrete elements of human consumption behaviour and develop a better understand of the wider inputs including culture, societal norms, institutions and governance. The research methodology adopted uses a systematic literature review approach coupled with thematic analysis. The study presents a new understanding of the interrelatedness of consumption policy, social structures, and the boundary arrangements of governance. What emerges is a focus on the role of governance and societal context in influencing outcomes. A fundamental output of the study is the designation of 27 evidence-based principles of change. These principles represent a new framework: the Governance and Sustainable Policy Development (GSPD) framework or 'Road Map', designed to guide decision making and aid the understanding of what motivates individuals and institutions within a wider neo-liberal societal system to manage their consumption from a more sustainable policy and governance perspective.

AB  - Objectives: To highlight the role of occupational physician (OP) in occupational injuries (OI) prevention and management. To suggest an approach beyond traditional focus on descriptive epidemiology, engineering interventions, administrative aspects of OI prevention. To promote a person- and enterprise-tailored approach, entailing greater attention to human factors and to practical problems of the specific workplace, with a call to a leading role played by OP. Methods and results: Analysis of the literature on the broader topic of OI prevention revealed thousands of publications; however, only a handful of them mention or describe the participation of OP in OI prevention. While recognizing that literature search is not the proper and only way to appreciate the current role of OP in this field, therefore, it seems necessary to call OP to a stronger effort in prevention and management of OI, through the context of a comprehensive intervention in cooperation with managers, supervisors, safety personnel and workers, focusing on specific needs of each enterprise. The following areas of OP intervention were examined: risk assessment, health surveillance, management, scientific research and health education. Within each of these topics, possible contributions, methodologies, instruments available for the OP were discussed, taking into account the relevant literature. Pathways for practical applications were illustrated, e.g., OI data generation and analyses, predictors of OI, fitness for work, case management, team work, educational issues, first aid, suggestion for OP contribution in specific research questions. Conclusions: OI continue to take a remarkable toll from individuals and society. New multidisciplinary interventions are needed to prevent OI. Focused activities at the single worksite with a central role from OP are definite options. OP is an effective interface between workforce and management and may offer, through a proactive approach, valuable practical and cultural contributions, while respecting technical and ethical guidelines of occupational health professionals.

AB  - Policy-makers are increasingly in search for evidence-based solutions for meeting contemporary challenges of energy services that are both low carbon and sustainable. One of the emerging trends are policies and regulations that incent distributed electricity generation, DG. The question that this article addresses is: what is the current state of the study of these policies or regulations in the Americas? The focus on the Americas was chosen because the article is part of a larger research project that explores regulations for DG in Brazil and Canada. This article uses a non-traditional means for synthesizing academic work; systematic literature review to explore the current state of peer-reviewed publications on the subject. It is a means of transparently locating, evaluating and synthesizing information to avoid bias in data collection. In total, 87 articles were included in the review. Climate Change is the main driving force for DG, as identified in the articles. Job creation or the green economy was cited as a motivating factor more strongly in North America. While in the southern countries, the issue of diversifying the energy mix and avoiding infrastructure costs was more pronounced. Many articles dealt with the issue of mechanisms for incenting DG and over half of these focused on aspects of Feed-in-tariffs. Incentive mechanisms vary depending on policy goals of the jurisdictions, with Renewable Portfolio Standards being more popular in the U.S. The review showed that there is little emphasis on the social impacts and benefits of the regulations or policies and that specific urban challenges and local governance is not widely investigated, pointing to a need for future study in these areas.

AB  - Today's rapidly changing economic and social environment requires many new and sustainable solutions for the agricultural sector, in particular in terms of achieving higher yields and conserving arable land. However, the latest technologies and innovative ideas could answer these issues and even support a smooth transition into a green economy. The current work studies one of the best solutions-consumer acceptance. Even though vertical farming is relatively widely researched, the potential clients are seldom analysed. The applied systematic literature review (PRISMA) approach revealed various vital characteristics related to the consumers based on academic publications. According to the selected studies' results, consumers' adoption of innovative technology is most influenced by prior knowledge of vertical farming and the importance of sustainability. Some studies found further correlations between age and gender regarding adoption, while others did not investigate these or found their role irrelevant. Most consumers found vertical farming "too artificial" and identified this as a major inhibiting factor. However, further investigation has shown that appropriate and informative marketing could significantly increase the understanding of the concept and, through this, the acceptance and widespread practical application of the innovation. In addition, the authors want to use the current work to highlight the unsettled state of vertical management. It can be concluded that new regulations could increase confidence in vertical farming, which could be further supported by the theoretical model developed in this study, thus allowing the creation of a fully traceable product chain.

AB  - Objective: Many studies have examined the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on human pain perception in both healthy populations and pain patients. Nevertheless, studies have yielded conflicting results, likely due to differences in stimulation parameters, experimental paradigms, and outcome measures. Human experimental pain models that utilize indices of pain in response to well-controlled noxious stimuli can avoid many confounds present in clinical data. This study aimed to assess the robustness of tDCS effects on experimental pain perception among healthy populations.
   Methods: We conducted three meta-analyses that analyzed tDCS effects on ratings of perceived pain intensity to suprathreshold noxious stimuli, pain threshold and tolerance.
   Results: The meta-analyses showed a statically significant tDCS effect on attenuating pain-intensity ratings to suprathreshold noxious stimuli. In contrast, tDCS effects on pain threshold and pain tolerance were statistically non-significant. Moderator analysis further suggested that stimulation parameters (active electrode size and current density) and experimental pain modality moderated the effectiveness of tDCS in attenuating pain-intensity ratings.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of tDCS on attenuating experimental pain perception depends on both stimulation parameters of tDCS and the modality of experimental pain.
   Significance: This study provides some theoretical basis for the application of tDCS in pain management. (C) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Promoting and increasing the uptake of sustainable agricultural practices poses a major challenge for European agricultural policy. The scientific evidence for potentially relevant and environmentally beneficial practices, however, is scattered among numerous sources. This article examines the state of knowledge regarding agri-environmental practices and their impact on various domains of the environment (climate change, soil, water and biodiversity). The selection was restricted to practices applicable to German farmers. Ninety-eight literature reviews and meta-analyses assessing the environmental impacts of agri-environmental practices in the German context were found in a systematic review of the academic literature from 2011 onwards. A total of 144 agricultural management practices were identified that contribute toward achieving certain environmental objectives. The practices were clustered in eight categories: (1) Fertilizer strategies, (2) Cultivation, (3) Planting: vegetation, landscape elements & other, (4) Grazing strategies, (5) Feeding strategies, (6) Stable management, (7) Other, (8) Combined practices & bundles. The findings of this study suggest that some general patterns can be observed regarding the environmental benefits of different practices. While it is possible to derive recommendations for specific practices in terms of individual environmental objectives, their relevance is likely to be context-dependent. Moreover, this study reveals that bundles of practices can have positive synergistic impacts on the environment. Notably, only few reviews and meta-analyses considered the implementation and opportunity costs of environmentally beneficial practices. Agri-environmental policies need to consider the broad range of practices that have been shown to impact the environment positively, including their costs, and provide context-specific incentives for farmers to adopt them.

AB  - Climate change has influenced the demand for natural resources, such as water, energy, and food. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus and climate change through a review and analysis of scientific publications to discern trends towards sustainability. The methodology adopted in this study involved i) selection, processing, and merging of databases; ii) a bibliometric analysis; and iii) a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods. The findings of this study reflect a strong relationship between the WEF nexus and sustainability influenced by climate change, which highlights the need to balance natural resource availability, growing population demand, and productive activities in a given territory. The bibliometric analysis performed in this study included interactions between the WEF nexus and climate change by considering 1,220 scientific publications from the Scopus and Web of Science databases that covered policy, sustainability, management, and governance aspects. Based on five keyword clusters of the WEF nexus, climate change, and sustainability, it also extracted the research directions from the systematic literature review of 104 documents. This study summarises the interest in the WEF nexus and highlights that the utilization and management of the natural resources of a region so as to balance the WEF nexus and climate change is among the most significant challenges of the 21st century.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has proven to be a powerful tool for utilizing the rapidly increasing amounts of remote sensing data for environmental monitoring. Yet ML models often require a substantial amount of ground truth labels for training, and models trained using labeled data from one domain often demonstrate poor performance when directly applied to other domains. Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a promising strategy to address domain shift and alleviate the need for labeled data. Here we provide the first systematic review of TL studies in environmental remote sensing. We start by defining the different forms of domain shift and then describe five commonly used TL techniques. We then present the results of a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022, which identified 1676 papers. Applications of TL in remote sensing have increased rapidly, with nearly 10 times more publications in 2022 than in 2017. Across seven categories of applications (land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, soil property estimation, crop yield prediction, biodiversity monitoring, water resources management, and natural disaster management) we identify several recent successes of TL as well as some remaining research gaps. Finally, we highlight the need to organize benchmark datasets explicitly for TL in remote sensing for model evaluation. We also discuss potential research directions for TL studies in environmental remote sensing, such as realizing scale transfer, improving model interpretability, and leveraging foundation models for remote sensing tasks.

AB  - Globally the demand for housing is far more than supply, resulting to 100 million+ been homeless and with one billion people living in inadequate homes. In addition, recent world crisis such as high rural urban migration, natural disasters like the Syria-Turkey earth quake, flooding, conflicts such as the ongoing Russia-Urkraine war, COVID-19 protocols of social distance and isolation, etc. exacerbates the housing deficit. Whilst the current approach to housing especially in developing countries concentrates on convention unsustainable approach to affordable housing delivery. With the few sustainable housing development attempts been far luxurious beyond average Ghanaian affordability. This research seeks to contribute to address housing deficit problems using frugal Innovation (FI) as a game changer to sustainable affordable housing (SAH) through a bibliometrics and a systematic review study. With regards to financial, resource-constrained, significant cost reductions over existing options and sustainable solutions, one idea currently gaining traction is frugal innovation (FI). It is more affordable than the conventional approach to development and can convert constraint into opportunity in a sustainable manner, as well as have a direct link to sustainable affordable development. Search for this study was on all disciplines with publications linked to frugal innovation and sustainable affordable housing limited to only online articles, conference publications, books, and other materials published in English on Scopus, science direct, and Google Scholar. The finding revealed, FI is a combination of all similar innovations, under one umbrella to serve the underserved bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market, making it superior to other forms of innovation. This study will contribute significantly to improving the policy direction of stakeholders in an attempt to reduce the housing deficit in Ghana and other developing countries globally. In addition, it will contribute to the UN-SDGs and UN-Habitat policymakers on the sustainable cities 2030 agenda.

AB  - A living lab is a physical or virtual space in which to solve societal challenges, especially for urban areas, by bringing together various stakeholders for collaboration and collective ideation. Although the notion has received increasing attention from scholars, practitioners and policy makers, its essence remains unclear to many. We therefore performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 114 scholarly articles about living labs to understand the central facets discussed in the nascent literature. In particular, we explored the origin of the living lab concept and its key paradigms and characteristics, including stakeholder roles, contexts, challenges, main outcomes, and sustainability. While doing this, we discovered that the number of publications about living labs has increased significantly since 2015, and several journals are very active in publishing articles on the topic. The living lab is considered a multi-disciplinary phenomenon and it encompasses various research domains despite typically being discussed under open and user innovation paradigms. What is more, the existing literature views living labs simultaneously as landscapes, real-life environments, and methodologies, and it suggests that they include heterogeneous stakeholders and apply various business models, methods, tools and approaches. Finally, living labs face some challenges, such as temporality, governance, efficiency, user recruitment, sustainability, scalability and unpredictable outcomes. In contrast, the benefits include tangible and intangible innovation and a broader diversity of innovation. Based on our analysis, we provide some implications and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Computer vision (CV) technology, a key subset of artificial intelligence, provides powerful tools for extracting valuable insights from visual data, which is a crucial component for the urban planning process. Despite the promising potential of CV in urban planning, its applications in this context have not been thoroughly examined. This lack of scholarship represents a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the role of CV in urban planning. This paper aims to provide a consolidated understanding in CV applications in the urban planning process and challenges urban planners face during the adoption of CV. The paper conducts a systematic literature review to tackle the questions of how is CV applied in the urban planning process, and what are the challenges in adopting CV techniques and tools for the urban planning process? The findings revealed: (a) CV could support a broad range of urban planning tasks including data collection and analysis, issue identification and prioritisation, public participation, plan design and adoption, and implementation and evaluation; (b) CV could improve decision-making through various visual information, but its limitations need to be considered, and; (c) Utilisation of CV for urban planning could support the efforts in sustainable urban development. This study informs urban policy- and plan-making circles by providing insights into the existing and prospective contributions of CV in the planning process, how CV transforms and augments planning practices, and elaborates the challenges and limitations of CV adoption.

AB  - The purpose of this clinical practice guideline developed by the American Psychological Association (APA) is to provide recommendations concerning multicomponent behavioral treatment of obesity and overweight in children and adolescents. Intended users of the guideline include psychologists, other health and mental health professionals, patients, families, and policymakers. The guideline development panel (GDP) used a systematic review conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-Based Practice Center as its primary evidence base (O'Connor, Burda, Eder, Walsh, & Evans, 2016). The GDP consisted of researchers and clinicians in psychology, medicine, nursing, and nutrition as well as adult community members who had childhood and adolescent experience with obesity. Critical outcomes used in rating evidence and formulating recommendations were change in body mass index (BMI or zBMI) and serious adverse events. For child and adolescent patients aged 2 to 18 years with obesity or overweight, the GDP strongly recommends the provision of family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions, with a minimum of 26 contact hours, initiated at the earliest age possible. Due to insufficient evidence, the GDP was not able to make recommendations about specific forms of family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions with respect to their comparative effectiveness; associations with adherence, engagement, or retention in treatment; or specific effectiveness with patients or families with particular characteristics. Considerations and challenges related to implementing the recommended interventions are discussed, and areas in which additional research is needed are identified.

AB  - Purpose: This paper addresses to the research gap on the role played by a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels by presenting a research agenda in the form of a conceptual framework. The research agenda discussed in this paper is based on the argument that a brand provides an assurance of the quality and functional capability of the products to new users of old products, delivers rational benefits to business customers, and strengthens the customer base of manufacturers. Methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted to develop propositions to develop deep insights into the role of a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels. Findings: Based on an extensive review of the literature, this study suggests that a brand can enhance customer equity, growth of the business customer and profits of the business customer by increasing in its efforts to influence the adoption of reverse-channels. Furthermore, the study proposes that an increase in the intention of a manufacturer to take on innovation in sustainability initiatives in its reverse logistics-based business process can increase the probability of the adoption of an approach towards reverse logistics. Originality/value/contribution: Using a systematic review of the literature, this study contributes to the area of research by developing a novel theoretical understanding of the role of a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels.

AB  - IntroductionFood security in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is an international policy priority. SIDS have high rates of nutrition-related non-communicable diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, micronutrient deficiencies and, in many, persistent childhood stunting. This is associated with an increasing reliance on imported processed food of poor nutritional quality. Calls have been made for strengthening local food systems, resilient to climate change, to increase the consumption of nutritious locally produced food. We aimed to systematically review interventions intended to improve diet in SIDS, and specifically explore whether these interventions applied a local food approach.MethodsThe search strategy was applied to 11 databases, including in health, social science and agriculture. Screening of titles, abstracts and data extraction was undertaken in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tools. Narrative synthesis of the results was undertaken. The study protocol was registered (PROSPERO registration number: 2020CRD42020201274).ResultsFrom 26 062 records, 154 full texts were reviewed and 24 were eligible. Included studies were from the Caribbean, Pacific, Mauritius and Singapore. Five were a randomised study design, one an interrupted time series analysis, eight controlled and ten uncontrolled pre-test and post-test. Nine studies included some aspect of a local food approach. Most interventions (n=15) included nutrition education, with evidence of effectiveness largely limited to those that also included practical skills training, such as vegetable gardening or food preparation. Three studies were considered low risk of bias, with the majority (n=13) of moderate risk.ConclusionThere is a lack of robust evidence on interventions to improve diet in SIDS. The evidence suggests that multifaceted approaches are likely to be the most effective, and local food approaches may promote effectiveness, through mechanisms of cultural and contextual relevance. Further development and evaluation of interventions is urgently required to increase the comparability of these studies, to help guide policy on improving nutrition in SIDS.

AB  - New major road infrastructure projects are planned or underway across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and are expected to have complex, and often deleterious, impacts on natural ecosystems across the region. For this reason, it is necessary to review evidence of how and through which mechanisms, roads might affect these landscapes. We reviewed 137 peer reviewed articles and documented 271 reported effects of roads and their underlying mechanisms inside and outside protected areas across SSA. Our findings show that (a) the study of the effects of roads on ecosystems in SSA is growing and not limited to the field of road ecology; (b) the negative effects of roads on species were reported at a similar frequency within and outside of protected areas; (c) the road-effect zone varied with effect but typically is between 1 and 7 km for larger mammals; (d) access to surrounding ecosystems through roads was the main mechanism driving effects; studies found accessibility influenced land use patterns and illegal hunting and harvesting; (e) other mechanisms by which roads affect (animal) species include, through functioning as a foraging site, and a habitat, and by acting as barriers to and corridors for movement; and (f) there was far more evidence on how roads can negatively impact ecosystems; in contrast, there was less certainty around mechanisms by which roads had no significant or a positive impact, since many of these were either speculated or unknown. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms can assist researchers and environmental assessment practitioners to predict how and where future road development might drive changes in biodiversity and land cover. Moving forward, we suggest that future research build a better understanding of the cumulative effects on different mammal and non-mammal communities and ecosystems more broadly and examine the socioeconomic contexts that characterize different road impacts in SSA.

AB  - This review article has attempted to address the problems associated with river sand mining and the adverse impacts of CO2 emissions from the construction sector. The PRISMA framework employed a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for the data extraction. The various strength parameters, such as relative compressive strength, relative splitting tensile strength, and relative flexural strength of concrete made from recycled aggregates (RAs) and silica fume (SF), were examined. The experimental results from various past studies have shown that 30% of RAs achieve a similar strength compared to concrete made by natural aggregates (NAs). At 50%, the compressive strength was merely reduced, and at 100%, a significant reduction in strength was seen. The positive variation in the strength was seen when SF incorporated from 5 to 20%. However, the best outcome in compressive strength was reported at a 10% ordinary Portland cement (OPC) replacement. The durability of concrete made by RAs was slightly lower, and SF-based concrete was higher than regular concrete. The sample calculations for China from (2011 to 2013) showed that by replacing 10% of OPC with SF, 3.96 x 107 tons of CO2 emission could be reduced, and by replacing 50% of river sand with recycled fine aggregate (RFA), 7.35 x 108 tons of river sand can be saved annually. It can be concluded from this review study that the combination of RFA and SF waste would be environmentally friendly in association with more sustainable concrete.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The advent of innovation compelled scholars to go beyond personal ideological views towards sustainable issues, consequently losing the perspective of technological freedom. With that in mind, the polarised technological landscape in which industrial maintenance finds itself seems to exhibit more philosophical behaviour, as observed by the exponential rise of narrative reviews. Nevertheless, in the face of the industrial "Fourth Wave", academicians who govern scientific advancement of maintenance, underpinned with Research and Innovation funds, seem to be disseminating excess scientific tutelage rather than productively altering maintenance, which provoked us to conduct a twofold analysis. Firstly, based on the Evidence-Based Approach (EBA), we systematically analyse maintenance-related EU projects. Secondly, to align with Green Deal EU targets by fostering decarbonisation of asset-intensive industries, we utilise the Preferred Reporting Items and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework for analysing energy-dedicated maintenance literature. The evidence suggests that ongoing research includes optimisation of maintenance activities for the sake of sustainability, on one side, while on the other, evidence suggests that energy consumption parameters can be considered as maintenance indicators used for diagnostic and prognostic feature selection purposes. Finally, results provide several insights: (1) absence of sustainability indicators in decision-making is a strong argument for the lack of maintenance impact in Industry 4.0, (2) manufacturing sector represents the first momentum of Energy-Based Maintenance evolution, and (3) gentrification and technology transfer activities will enable the smoother transition of sustainable maintenance practice.

AB  - Aim: The widely observed positive response of productivity to biodiversity, known as the biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR), underpins nature-based solutions for mitigating and adapting to global changes. Little is known of the role of such emergent processes in the restoration of damaged ecosystems. Here, we test for evidence of a BPR in degraded freshwater lakes, and its role in underpinning or undermining lake recovery from eutrophic states.
   Location: Lower Yangtze and Huaihe river basins, China, East Asia.
   Taxa: Freshwater phytoplankton; also macrophytes, fish, zooplankton and zoobenthos.
   Methods: A systematic review of biodiversity studies was conducted to enumerate freshwater biodiversity change during eutrophication, encompassing 572 samples from 155 lakes in East China. Empirical samples were then taken of 93 phytoplankton communities from 38 lakes in ecologically degraded states of eutrophication. Samples were analysed for niche overlap in relation to biodiversity and productivity, and metrics of network structure indicative of community stability.
   Results: Reviewed publications on eutrophication in East China lakes revealed losses in biodiversity of macrophytes, fishes, zooplankton and zoobenthos but not phytoplankton. Empirically sampled eutrophic lakes maintained high phytoplankton biodiversity through niche differentiation, and phytoplankton biodiversity correlated positively with biomass, in line with the expectations of BPR.
   Conclusions: The positive effect of biodiversity on phytoplankton productivity in eutrophic lakes acts in opposition to the negative impacts on productivity induced by eutrophication-management strategies of nutrient suppression. In degraded systems, the BPR contributes to sustaining productivity of lake phytoplankton communities, impeding recovery from a eutrophic state. This is a case of the BPR playing an undesirable role at the ecosystem level. Lake recovery programmes need to anticipate that the control of phytoplankton biomass will depend on reducing nutrients to a level sufficient to degrade the internal structure of the phytoplankton community.

AB  - In the last decades there has been great concern about sustainability, especially in companies, where the concept of sustainable development is no longer a trend, but a reality. In the logistics field it should not be any different, since it's importance to the movement of goods and people. This movement is carried out by four transportation modals, road, air, rail and river. The road transportation is widely used in relation to the others, bringing some problems in large urban centers like traffic jams, climate change, pollution, high CO2 emissions, among others. Thus, it is currently a great challenge to make the logistics greener, balancing logistic modals, reducing freight transport by road and shift to other modals. The inland waterway transport in this context stands out, since it is the most sustainable transportation in logistics, besides having lower costs. Based on this information, this study aims to discover the main challenges and opportunities for the development of river logistics as a sustainable alternative. Using a systemic approach the research analyzed articles of the river logistics field from the last five years. It was possible to identify the main challenges and opportunities in the articles, guide surveys to fill the main gaps, and shows a discussion to better understand the situation considering what actions are being taken and what are needed for the river logistics development.

AB  - This review summarizes the methods and approaches for quantifying the sustainability performance of roads based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) concept. Furthermore, research gaps and challenges in the sustainability assessment of roads are identified. While prior studies explored the environmental and economic dimensions, no comprehensive overview of holistic sustainability assessment of roads exists. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify relevant studies. Two assessment approaches were identified: (1) life-cycle-based approaches and (2) sustainability rating systems (SRS). Most of the reviewed studies applied life-cycle-based methods, such as Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment or a combination of Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing, and selected social indicators. Heterogeneity in functional units was observed, with most studies opting for a dimension-based instead of a function-based reference. There was high variability regarding the life cycle stages, indicators, and impact assessment methods. Concerning the interpretation methods, most studies calculated a sustainability index or applied Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods. The SRS presented a similar structure with different levels of aggregation. Furthermore, aspects such as planning, leadership, innovation, and construction activities were addressed. The results of this SLR contribute to expanding the knowledge regarding road sustainability and provide insight into common frameworks, guidelines, and best practices for the sustainability assessment of roads and pavements.

AB  - Building envelopes are perhaps the most influencing players on assuring indoor comfort conditions, in alliance with their impact on the sustainability and energy-efficiency of the building during operation. However, given the multitude of commercial solutions available on the market and the use of different criteria and inconsistent semantics among the existing categorization/classification systems of construction objects, there is still a need for uniformisation of the many regarding the main Prefabricated Enclosure Wall Panel Systems (PEWPS) for building applications. In such context, this paper firstly explores the distinct categories of off-site Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), and how can they be classified. Secondly, focus will be given to panelised systems, where the classification of PEWPS is thoroughly investigated. Lastly, a summarised literature review of selected innovative research trends in advanced building envelopes is presented, with positive consequences on the comfort, energy and environmental performance of buildings. The purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive framework to understand which singularities and challenges are associated with PEWPS; This set of tools should be accessible to designers (and construction stakeholders in general) to realise how each building solution is supposed to work on the road to fulfilling user requirements.

AB  - Biological invasions via anthropogenic vectors, intentional or not, are one of the main causes of ecological change in aquatic ecosystems. Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802) is often introduced for sport fishing purposes and is broadly distributed worldwide; it has been listed by IUCN as one of the 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases to synthesize the existing knowledge concerning introductions of M. salmoides introductions and their ecological impacts. We highlight major trends and gaps related to spatiotemporal patterns of the publications, research methods and ecological impacts. The number of publications relating to impacts of M. salmoides began to grow in the 1990's and has been increasing in the last years. Studies of the species' impact have been conducted in 16 countries, primarily in the Palearctic realm. There is a lack of studies in tropical and megadiverse regions. Most of the studies used field observational methodologies, with only a few theoretical studies. Most of the field observational studies were conducted in rivers and reservoirs. Impacts at the population and community levels, such as the local extirpation of native species and food web changes, were described more often than impacts at other biological levels. Finally we emphasize the necessity of developing management strategies in order to remove or, at least, control M. salmoides outside of its natural range and to deter additional introduction events into new habitats.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a major threat to the integrity of ecosystems and is projected to worsen, yet the path to successful conservation remains elusive. Decision support frameworks (DSFs) are increasingly applied by resource managers to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and differing socio-ecological objectives inherent to conservation problems. Most published conservation research that uses DSFs focuses on analytical stages (e.g., identifying an optimal decision), making it difficult to assess and learn from previous examples in a conservation practice context. Here, we (1) evaluate the relationship between the application of decision science and the resulting conservation outcomes, and (2) identify and address existing barriers to the application of DSFs to conservation practice. To do this, we develop a framework for evaluating conservation initiatives using decision science that emphasizes setting attainable goals, building momentum, and obtaining partner buy-in. We apply this framework to a systematic review of amphibian conservation decision support projects, including a followup survey of the pertinent conservation practitioners, stakeholders, and scientists. We found that all projects identified optimal solutions to reach stated objectives, but positive conservation outcomes were limited when implementation challenges arose. Further, we identified multiple barriers (e.g., dynamic and hierarchical leadership, scale complexity, limited resource availability) that can inhibit the progression from decision identification to action implementation (i.e., 'decision-implementation gap'), and to successful conservation outcomes. Based on these results, we provide potential actionable steps and avenues for future development of DSFs to facilitate the transition from decision to action and the realization of conservation successes.

AB  - Groundwater represents a critical water source for plants, especially during drought, with continuous groundwater availability widely associated with the presence of ecological refugia and the preservation of biodiversity during pe-riods of adverse conditions. Here, we present a systematic quantitative literature review of global groundwater and ecosystem interactions to synthesise current knowledge and identify key knowledge gaps and research priorities through a management lens. Despite increasing research on groundwater dependent vegetation since the late 1990s, significant geographical and ecological biases are evident with papers focused on arid regions or areas with sig-nificant anthropogenic changes. Of the 140 papers reviewed, desert and steepe arid landscapes accounted for 50.7 % and desert and xeric shrublands were represented in 37.9 % of papers. A third of papers (34.4 %) quantified ground-water uptake by ecosystems and groundwater contributions to transpiration, with studies examining the influence of groundwater on vegetation productivity, distribution, and composition also well represented. In contrast, groundwater influences on other ecosystem functions are relatively poorly explored. The research biases introduce uncertainty in the transferability of findings between locations and ecosystems limiting the generality of our current understanding. This synthesis contributes to consolidating a solid knowledge base of the hydrological and ecological interrelationships for managers, planners, and other decision-makers that is relevant to the landscapes and environments they manage, so can more effectively deliver ecological and conservation outcomes.

AB  - Low carbon city (LCC) has emerged as the latest sustainable urbanism strategy in China as a response to climate change impacts. Yet, minimal scholarships have explored the sustainability of the urban planning model towards understanding the complexity of the components. Using a two-step triangulation approach, this paper presents a structured overview of the LCC initiative in China as it relates to the transition to a sustainability paradigm. The data collection approach includes a comprehensive review of 238 articles on LCC to identify and categorize LCC components. Furthermore, discourse and framing analysis was used to develop and synthesize a conceptual framework for assimilating the components into four core sustainable development principles: Integration, implementation, equity, and scalability and replicability. The results indicate that LCC development in China is bias towards economic and environmental technological innovations and strategies. Additionally, several critical sustainability issues of LCC pilots were identified. These include a lack of social equity planning concerns for the most vulnerable population, dearth of social reforms that cater to lifestyle and behavioral change, top-down planning and decision-making processes, a technocratic rationalization planning approach, inconsistent LCC targets on inter-generational justice concerns, absence of an effective national "sharing and learning" city-city network system, and several barriers to implementation. We conclude that the applied theoretical and conceptual inquiry into the field of LCC is pertinent to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable urban development.

AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is indicative of changes in climate and geomorphology. It has been found that LSWT has shown faster warming than air temperature in recent decades, which has greatly affected the aquatic ecosystem of lakes and even led to ecological collapse. It was mainly caused by climate warming and geomorphological changes caused by human activities. However, lakes with different properties respond differently to these changes, resulting in temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the changes of LSWT. After an extensive literature review, it was found that the research on LSWT is mainly focused on the following aspects: 1) qualitative or quantitative analysis of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting LSWT changes; 2) impacts of LSWT changes on lake ecology; 3) acquisition of LSWT data, such as retrieval based on remote sensing imagery, model-based simulation prediction; and 4) study of temporal and spatial variation characteristics of LSWT long time series. Dynamically monitoring LSWT changes, predicting, and quantifying the response of lakes with different properties to abrupt or gradual climate changes and changes in human activity intensity, can inform modeling of ecosystem response processes and long-term management planning of large freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, this article provides a systematic review of LSWT from the above four aspects to provide empirical insight and methodological reference for conducting LSWT research.

AB  - More than a decade has passed since the triple crises of food, energy and finance in the period 2007-2008. Those events turned global investor interest to agriculture and its commodities and thereafter the leasing of tens of millions of hectares of land. This article reviews and synthesizes the available evidence regarding the agricultural investments that have taken place in Ethiopia since that time. We use a systematic review approach to identify literature from the Web of Science and complement that with additional literature found via Google Scholar. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to analyze the available literature. In so doing, we raise questions of data quality, by analyzing the evidence base used by many studies (the Land Matrix database) and compare it with data we obtained from the Government of Ethiopia. We find that while the Land Matrix is the largest available database, it appears to present only a fraction of the reality. In critically assessing the literature, we identify areas that have been under-researched or are missing from the literature, namely assessments of gendered impacts, the role of diaspora and domestic investors, interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., integrating climate change, biodiversity, and water), and studies that move beyond technical assessment, such as looking at the impacts on traditional knowledge and socio-cultural systems.

AB  - The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new 'symbiotic digital architecture' to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.

AB  - Area-based fisheries management measures (ABFMs) are commonly related to the sustainable use of resources but are increasingly considered broader conservation measures. This Scoping Review (ScR) identified and mapped the evidence base regarding the contribution of ABFMs to fisheries sustainability and marine conservation. The ScR was conducted following the JBI methodology and the PRISMA statement. A total of 2,391 documents were identified, and following a two-stage screening process, 151 documents were eventually included in the ScR for full review and data extraction. Most of the documents were published during the last 12 years. Studies had a wide geographical distribution (mainly located in Europe and North America), were primarily conducted at the subnational level, concerned fishing restrictions of towed gears, and assessed ABFMs from a single stock's perspective. ABFMs identified were of various types, and the use of terminology was not consistent in the literature. Multiple combinations of data collection (primarily experimental surveys/sampling and open data sources) and analysis methods (most commonly, fisheries and ecological analyses and modelling) were applied (often in combination), using a variety of different metrics. Various knowledge gaps emerged, mainly related to the study of ABFMs networks and the application of an interdisciplinary and ecosystem-based approach for assessing ABFMs. The social, economic, and environmental impact of ABFMs was positive in most cases (56%) and in less cases negative (22%) or mixed (14%). This ScR is a valuable source of information for the contribution of ABFMs to rebuilding marine ecosystems and attaining CBD conservation targets through the lens of the OECM concept.

AB  - Rural economies are crucial for global development, with more than 80% of the world's population living in rural areas and agriculture providing livelihoods for approximately 2.5 billion people worldwide. However, these economies are often vulnerable to various factors, including climate change, natural disasters, and a lack of progressive economic policies. The main aim of making rural economies more sustainable is to promote long-term economic development, protect the environment, and improve the quality of life in urban-rural communities. This paper explored certain strategies for enhancing rural economies to be more sustainable. The results show that smart growth has been rapidly growing in urban cities, while certain communities outside urban areas have been left behind. However, both urban and rural communities need economic growth and be adaptive to smart growth to serve their communities and adhere to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the new era of innovation. Thus, we argue that rural areas are a big part of emerging economies. As such, they cannot be left behind in any smart growth. In this study, we found that rural economies need training and up-skilling in order to improve their sustainability and efficiency targets. Through a systematic review, this paper looked at various ways rural communities can solve their challenges toward smart growth and the sustainability of their resources. As a result, we propose solutions for urban-rural communities to implement in daily activities in terms of policy and practice approaches.

AB  - Glacierized mountains are often referred to as our world's water towers because glaciers both store water over time and regulate seasonal stream flow, releasing runoff during dry seasons when societies most need water. Ice loss thus has the potential to affect human societies in diverse ways, including irrigation, agriculture, hydropower, potable water, livelihoods, recreation, spirituality, and demography. Unfortunately, research focusing on the human impacts of glacier runoff variability in mountain regions remains limited, and studies often rely on assumptions rather than concrete evidence about the effects of shrinking glaciers on mountain hydrology and societies. This article provides a systematic review of international research on human impacts of glacier meltwater variability in mountain ranges worldwide, including the Andes, Alps, greater Himalayan region, Cascades, and Alaska. It identifies four main areas of existing research: (1) socioeconomic impacts; (2) hydropower; (3) agriculture, irrigation, and food security; and (4) cultural impacts. The article also suggests paths forward for social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences research that could more accurately detect and attribute glacier runoff and human impacts, grapple with complex and intersecting spatial and temporal scales, and implement transdisciplinary research approaches to study glacier runoff. The objective is ultimately to redefine and reorient the glacier-water problem around human societies rather than simply around ice and climate. By systematically evaluating human impacts in different mountain regions, the article strives to stimulate cross-regional thinking and inspire new studies on glaciers, hydrology, risk, adaptation, and human-environment interactions in mountain regions.

AB  - Noise can cause marine mammals to interrupt their feeding, alter their vocalizations, or leave important habitat, among other behavioural responses. The current North American paradigm for regulating activities that may result in behavioural responses identifies received levels (RL) of sound at which individuals are predicted to display significant behavioural responses (often termed harassment). The recurrent conclusion about the need for considering context of exposure, in addition to RL, when assessing probability and severity of behavioural responses led us to conduct a systematic literature review (370 papers) and analysis (79 studies, 195 data cases). The review summarized the critical and complex role of context of exposure. The analysis emphasized that behavioural responses in cetaceans (measured via a linear severity scale) were best explained by the interaction between sound source type (continuous, sonar, or seismic/explosion) and functional hearing group (a proxy for hearing capabilities). Importantly, more severe behavioural responses were not consistently associated with higher RL and vice versa. This indicates that monitoring and regulation of acoustic effects from activities on cetacean behaviour should not exclusively rely upon generic multispecies RL thresholds. We recommend replacing the behavioural response severity score with a response/no response dichotomous approach that can represent a measure of impact in terms of habitat loss and degradation.

AB  - E-waste is the source of both hazardous materials and valuable secondary resources. The challenge is to identify the potential for recovering value from this waste stream for different supply chains when there are diverse definitions in the field. The urban mining approach employs recycling and circular solutions inspired by principles such as industrial metabolism, industrial ecology, and the circular economy. This study presents a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on urban mining and a comprehensive analysis of the many definitions of value recovery. This includes the stages of e-waste urban mining, the value recovery potential according to circular economy principles, location, and critical raw materials (CRMs). The results suggest that the exploitation of anthropogenic urban mines depends on Waste-to-Resources (WtR) and Waste-to-Energy (WtE) ratios, and the techniques borrowed from conventional mining. We highlight the importance of e-waste as a secondary source of CRMs (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu, Li, and Co), and provide recommendations regarding the critical analysis of the potential of urban mining to mitigate the impact of e-waste through circular processes and value recovery. Innovation is needed to promote a sustainable circular economy, and a harmonized regulatory framework relating to social aspects and technical potential.

AB  - Adventure tourism operators have historically drawn upon a range of broad, multi-purpose sustainability frameworks to provide experiences that are more ecologically and socially just. However, these efforts have been hindered by the need to interpret and translate large volumes of diverse sustainability guidance, which is often unclear or prohibitively complex in terms of how it can be applied to specific adventure operations. This paper aims to address this issue by (1) identifying the primary types of sustainability guidance available for adventure operators; (2) critiquing the benefits and limitations of each form of guidance; and (3) making recommendations for research and practice. The inquiry employed a systematized review methodology, informed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to interrogate the various forms of sustainability guidance available to adventure tour operators. The analysis revealed three broad categories of guidance: Paid Memberships and Certifications, Guidelines and Frameworks, and Pledges and Declarations. The findings demonstrate how each of these categories brings distinct benefits and limitations to operators, depending on their size and scope of provision. Implications for practice are offered, in terms of how existing frameworks might be adopted and/or alternative approaches to integrating and monitoring sustainability initiatives developed. Suggestions for further research include examining adventure travellers' and operators' perceptions of the three different categories of guidance found in the current study, and the ways in which operators engage with this guidance.

AB  - Understanding how different ethno-cultural groups value urban nature is important to understand the role of ethno-cultural diversity in urban ecosystem management. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper summarizes the empirical evidence on how different ethno-cultural groups use, perceive, prefer, and assign meaning to urban nature. I use the urban forest, defined here as all the trees in a city, as a proxy to understand this process. The 31 studies reviewed here differ widely in their lines of inquiry, research methods, urban natural setting, and conceptualizations of ethno-cultural identity. Most studies take place in the US and Europe, where the most common definition of an ethno-culturally diverse group is a person of non-European/non-White background. Most studies focus on what these groups like about a particular urban natural setting, such as an urban park; and whether they like more or less trees in a specific context (e.g. urban park). These groups usually prefer passive and social uses of urban natural areas, and more manicured/functional natural landscapes with less trees. The most common meanings associated with urban natural settings dominated by trees are social interaction and integration. The most common explanations on why these differences occur involve theories on socio-economic marginality, collectivist vs. individualist cultures, urban vs. rural lifestyles, and landscapes of origin. Future research on the topic will benefit by differentiating race from ethnicity, capturing intra-ethnic variation, capturing immigrant identities, exploring the different social, cultural, and economic factors that influence values and/or preferences, and focusing on concrete aspects of urban nature, such as urban forests.

Due to the relatively small number of available studies from peer-reviewed sources, the variety of methods and data used and the constrained time available for this study, the study did not immediately lend itself to a more thorough systematic literature review.FindingsThe literature shows the discourse on TOD upholds its promise to create a high-density mixed-use walkable neighbourhood supported by transport infrastructure, increasing accessibility, minimising vehicle dependency, reducing traffic congestion, moderating urban sprawl and reducing pollution. There are few articles on the negative aspects of TOD, particularly concerning social exclusion, crime, sustainability and concerns about gentrification of neighbourhoods.Research limitations/implicationsThe study did not immediately lend itself to a more thorough systematic literature review due to the relatively small number of available studies, the variety of methods and data used and the constrained time available for this study.Originality/valueThis study allows social investigators, policymakers and developers understand the benefits and disbenefits of TOD including policy implications regarding potential criminogenic factors.

AB  - Conservation of the snow leopard (Panthera tmcia) is challenging because of its threatened status and increase in human-snow leopard conflict (HSC). The area of occupancy of the snow leopard comprises mountainous regions of Asia that are confronted with various environmental pressures including climate change. HSCs have increased with a burgeoning human population and economic activities that enhance competition between human and snow leopard or its preys. Here we systematically review the peer-reviewed literature from 1994 to 2018 in Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed (30 articles), to evaluate the current state of scholarship about HSCs and their management. We determine: 1) the spatio-temporal distribution of relevant researches; 2) the methodologies to assess HSCs; 3) and evaluate existing interventions for conflict management; and 4) the potential options for HSC management. The aim of the current study is thus to identify key research gaps and future research requirements. Of the articles in this review, 60% evaluated the mitigation of HSCs, while only 37% provided actionable and decisive results. Compensation programs and livestock management strategies had high success rates for mitigating HSCs through direct or community-managed interventions. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of existing HSC mitigation strategies, many of which, while recommended, lack proper support. In spite of the progress made in HSC studies, research is needed to examine ecological and sociocultural context of HSCs. We suggest future work focus on rangeland management for HSC mitigation, thus ultimately fostering a co-existence between human and snow leopard.

AB  - Translingual pedagogies have been proposed and implemented to respond to the increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in today's classrooms. However, the findings of translingual pedagogies on English as an additional language (EAL) writing vary from facilitating to undermining teaching and learning. To understand the empirical landscape of this young and fast-growing research area, I systematically reviewed 62 studies with a research synthesis method to explore what translingual activities have been implemented and how they have impacted EAL writing teaching and learning (including both K-12 and post-secondary contexts). The findings reveal that various translingual activities, such as self-reflective writing and literacy narrative, have been enacted in EAL writing teaching and learning. These activities have been practiced in different ways based on different rhetorical situations. The results show that translingual pedagogies can complement currently practiced EAL writing pedagogies, increase EAL student writers' awareness of English monolingualism, facilitate EAL writing teaching in different rhetorical situations, engage students in learning activities, and help view codemeshing as a matter of agency in EAL writing teaching and learning. Despite these benefits, there are some challenges to implementing translingual pedagogies, such as teachers' and students' concerns about codemeshing in high-stakes writing, the lack of teacher education and guidance in translingual pedagogies and practices, and the exclusion of some linguistically minoritized students. In sum, translingual pedagogies can enrich EAL writing teaching and learning, albeit with some challenges.

AB  - Contemporary smart city solutions rely on standardized von Neumann architecture, in which single data units are coded as "0" or "1." Conversely, urban quantum technologies rely on the fundamental principles of quantum physics, transcending the conventions of the current computational paradigm. On the one hand, urban quantum technologies hold managerial relevance for future smart cities. On the other hand, they are often overlooked by smart city researchers. Accordingly, their value as a breakthrough technological paradigm is still largely unexplored. In this article, we look at how quantum technologies may contribute to existing smart city solutions, including the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, ICT, smart transportation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. First, through a semi-systematic review of eighty articles on quantum computing within the social science domain, we identify two relevant classes of urban quantum technologies: quantum communication and quantum computing. Second, we establish a comprehensive taxonomy of conventional smart city solutions based on the automated content analysis of 567 abstracts of articles on the technological aspects of smart cities. Third, we investigate potential associations between two classes of technologies (conventional smart city solutions and urban quantum technologies) by analyzing the semantic relationships between eighty articles on quantum technologies according to the frequency of keywords denoting different types of conventional smart city solutions. Finally, we triangulate our findings through a thematic analysis of potential uses of quantum technologies within identified categories of smart city solutions.

AB  - Coastal areas are highly vulnerable to climate-change hazards (e.g., sea-level rise, flooding, coastal erosion), which can lead to significant impacts at the ecosystem and societal level. Interest in ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is gaining importance due to its potential multiple benefits, including social and environmental aspects, when compared to more traditional approaches such as hard engineering interventions. When assessing EbA strategies, further understanding of the nature-society functions, processes, values, and benefits is needed to increase its application. This study contributes to better knowledge of EbA and other adaptation strategies by developing a systematic literature review of studies performing socio-economic assessments of climate-change adaptation in coastal areas. The analysis of 54 publications revealed that cost-benefit analysis was applied in most studies, followed by multi-criteria analysis and other techniques. Hybrid adaptation strategies based on different combinations of hard, soft, and EbA interventions were considered as potential optimal solutions in a significant part of the assessments. This study shows some potential co-benefits of EbA, such as livelihood diversification or biodiversity conservation, but also stresses the need for further research on this topic, as well as on evaluating how EbA performs in the long term under changing climate-condition scenarios.

AB  - The rapid increase in coastal urbanization profoundly impacts various environmental components and significantly transforms coastal ecosystems to the degree they lose their integrity. Coastal zones are facing increasing pressure from socio-economic development and climate change. Sustainable coastal planning and management must understand better how humans changing the physical environment of coastal areas to present a rational and comprehensive direction for development. The purpose of this research is to systematically review, with the following aims: (1) describe scientific debates on anthropogenic activities on the coastal landscape; (2) systematically identify the landscape structure of the changing coastal ecosystem; and (3) discuss the consequences of the change. Research articles from the database are systematically mapped and reviewed to summarize the state of current evidence-based information related to the characters and effects of change. The 114 articles selected indicate that there are numerous adverse actions and consequences of anthropogenic landscape change. Humans significantly influence the structure of the coastal ecosystem. Consequently, the functions of the coastal ecosystem are altered and degraded. This review proposed spatial planning guidelines to maintain or restore the ecological integrity of coastal development, especially where only small portions of formerly intact coastal ecosystems remain.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss human competences required for sustainability management in organisations. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on a systematic review of the literature, through qualitative thematic analysis. Findings The research covered 15 years of scientific publications and was summarised in 43 articles. It revealed that education, more than management, was the field of knowledge with more references in human competences, through exploratory methodological approaches. The competences found were plenty, but there is still some misunderstanding regarding their conceptual and theoretical bases. Research limitations/implications This research provides evidence that the academic knowledge on the subject is still at its initial stage, and it exposes the debility of the management area in addressing the subject. Practical implications The authors intend to indicate to managers some fundamentals for the adoption of human competences for sustainability aiming at a more sustainable performance in organisations. Social implications The results may instigate studies concerning the fit of sustainability competences developed on higher education institutions and the job market. From it, curricula and pedagogical projects can be proposed and revised with better alignment to the organisational context. Originality/value This paper presents a theoretical contribution by building bridges among different perspectives and fields of knowledge on the topic. The paper also offers a managerial contribution by stimulating practical discussions to develop sustainability in organisations through individuals.

AB  - Forest therapy and recreation (FTR) has become a popular mode for promoting physical and mental health and enhancing well-being in the recent era. However, reliance on forests exposes it to potential dangers, such as the impact of over-development on natural ecology, the threat of mosquito bites and poisonous plants to tourists' health, and the lack of attractiveness, which can be seen as the limitation or the 'dark' sides of FTR that restrict its sustainable development. Scholars have begun to pay additional attention on this subject matter, however, effective identification, management, and circumvention of these 'dark' sides is still limited. A comprehensive review of the 'dark' side of FTR is still limited. Therefore, this research reveals five themes of the 'dark' side of FTR through 140 collected publications based on thematic analysis, and provides an in-depth analysis of each theme. On this basis, research gaps of existing studies were revealed and future research directions were clarified, including: (1) low impact development; (2) smart monitoring; (3) strategies to improve safety; (4) empirical medical research; (5) social participation attraction; (6) multidisciplinary research approach; (7) differentiated development; and (8) standard certification. Findings of this research reveal a knowledge map of the 'dark' side of FTR, guide researchers to develop a new perspective to conduct related research and provide a platform for practitioners understanding the constraints on development and help taking preventive management measures.

AB  - The pervasion of plastic and the inadequacies of the current plastic waste management processes are the premise of various studies that aimed to find sustainable solutions to the plastic waste issues. Amongst these solutions, plastic pyrolysis is particularly promising due to its commercial maturity and complementarity to mechanical recycling. In this paper, recent studies of plastic pyrolysis are reviewed and scrutinised, with particular attention given to feedstock composition, operating conditions, and catalytic choices. Our systematic review found that the success of plastic pyrolysis is dependent on many inter-related operational factors, such as temperature, resi-dence time, and feedstock characteristics. Thus, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance our understanding of the various interconnected parameters involved in plastic pyrolysis. However, AI capacity must be further improved to incorporate more variables such as contaminants, fluctuating feedstocks, and mixed polymers. Many Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) studies have provided abundant evidence showing that plastic pyrolysis is more environmentally beneficial incineration and landfill. Hence, future LCA studies should shift from a comparative perspective to a more holistic approach where plastic pyrolysis is considered as an integrated part of a sustainable waste management system. The review has also identified that more research efforts should be directed towards catalytic pyrolysis and monomer recovery.

AB  - Elinor Ostrom was the first woman ever to win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences with research in the field of economic governance. In order to map the scientific impact of her work and visualize the collective action from her perspective, this scientometric review was carried out using two groups of analysis. First, we analyzed the works authored or co-authored by Elinor Ostrom. Later, to conceptualize the reach of Ostrom's works and her academic impactwe analyzed the documents that cite her. The relevance of this study, as a systematic review of the scientific literature, lies in the fact that it can reveal important information through citation-induced patterns and guide researchers interested in collective action and the commons. The data was collected from the Web of Science and analyzed using a series of software to facilitate the observation of the data with the use of double map overlays, co -citation cluster, timeline views and others with the goal of being able to point out how the research in the area is being directed, the current topics, identify research gaps and interconnections with other fields of science. The results revealed central themes worked by the author and the current themes involved as a legacy of her work. The networks show through clusters the separation of topics that were carried out within the years and identify the most cited groups of authors, as well as the works that relate the most with themselves.

AB  - Climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) is among the top policy priorities for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their food, agriculture, and forestry sectors. However, the strategies that have been adopted to date have failed to produce positive changes or alter climate change trajectories. Scientific evidence is crucial for evidence-based policy making in this arena and elsewhere. We undertake a scoping review to explore what is known from the existing scientific literature about the policy recommendations for CRA in ASEAN. We follow the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for new systematic reviews. Furthermore, we conduct a content analysis to classify the policy recommendations into eight CRA policy categories and to investigate how the policies identified in the reviewed articles reinforce the climate resilience capacities (CRC) needed for CRA. The synthesis review is based on 47 papers. This research contributes to climate resilience literature, and explains how the results of this study could be applied in policy analysis to build CRC within the agricultural sector. The knowledge generated by this study can support policy design, and therefore support the building of an enabling environment for CRA for ASEAN and elsewhere.
   Key policy insightsScientific literature on CRA typically recommends policies that support communication and knowledge sharing and advance research and technology development, often in combination with risk management- and/or environmental/climate support.There is insufficient evidence on actual policies enabling CRA. This result may also reflect a lack of research on some of the identified CRA policy categories, such as agricultural production support, investment support, infrastructural support, land use regulation and certification.This synthesis review identifies literature addressing policy capacity to achieve CRA goals. Adaptability and transformability are key dimensions of policy capacity enabling responsive actions to climate change, mainly via social learning, in-depth learning and research and technology development. Literature pays little attention to anticipation and robustness, facilitating proactive ex-ante initiatives and coping for climate change; we argue that these dimensions of capacity merit further research.This synthesis demonstrates key gaps in research and understanding of CRA and related policies targeting capacity building, followed by a need to raise awareness of the importance of such policies. It also points to the need to enable preparation for climate-related crisis planning, through use of anticipatory policies and tools, such as climate predictions to inform planning of robust prevention measures.Last but not least, the synthesis identifies that representation across the ASEAN countries and the type of agricultural systems in is unbalanced; research from Vietnam and Malesia and research on rice production or rice in combination with other crops or shrimp are over-represented. We argue that research on climate change adaptation for other important agricultural production systems, covering the remaining ASEAN countries, is needed to fill this gap.

AB  - Beef cattle are the third most numerous terrestrial farmed animals worldwide. Factors such as geographical region, animal category, breed, and rearing system pose specific animal welfare challenges that can have an impact on animal and public health. This article uses text mining (TM) and topic analysis (TA) to explore the scientific literature on beef cattle welfare published in English from 1990 to 2019. Our aim was to reveal the main research topics and their evolution over time. Our analysis showed that the three most relevant themes in research since 1990 have to do with calf behaviour and management, efficiency, and environmental sustainability, and the effects of transport and slaughter on meat quality. Topics showing the most marked increase in the number of papers published deal with stakeholders' perceptions and market opportunities for added-value beef products and risk factors for morbidity and mortality, especially in relation to calf health, antimicrobial use, and antimicrobial resistance. The results indicate a particular focus on the welfare of calves, especially in the veal industry. Pain relief during the castration of calves and bulls also featured prominently. Research is also increasingly assessing aspects of beef cattle welfare that are interlinked to meat quality, the social and environmental sustainability of the sector in relation to market opportunities, and public health. The identified topics represent a basic source of information that can be used for further and more detailed analyses (e.g., systematic reviews) focussed on specific research themes or geographical areas.

AB  - Collaborative consumption (CC) is becoming a key concept in marketing. Despite the topic's relevance, the academic literature on consumer behavior in collaborative consumption remains very fragmented. This present research aims to provide a systematic review of consumer behavior in collaborative consumption research in the existing literature. An extensive literature review was systematically conducted on collaborative consumption spread over the time period between 2010 to 2021 published journals which were identified from online academic and research databases of Web of science and EBSCO. A total of 97 conceptual and empirical articles were analyzed based on criteria such as year of publication, theoretical underpinning, methodological approaches, etc. The paper highlights the critical emergent themes and sub-themes, extensively used methodologies and analysis approaches, and dominant theoretical underpinnings. By providing the distribution schema of collaborative consumption articles based on the mentioned criteria and the future research areas, the present study will help future researchers understand the current status of collaborative consumption research in the marketing and consumer behavior discipline and take this research area forward. Our theme-based segregation of collaborative consumption gives a deeper insight to the managers of sharing services concerning the key motivations and constraints of collaborative consumption. This systematic literature review provides a holistic view of consumer behavior in collaborative consumption. It highlights three major research themes (customer-centric studies, sustainability-centric studies, and consumer trust studies) and their related and relevant sub-themes to date addressed in the research studies.

AB  - Background
   Tremendous progress in acute stroke therapy has improved short-term outcome but part of this achievement may be lost in the long run. Concepts for a better long-term management of stroke survivors are needed to address their unmet needs and to reduce the burden of post-stroke complications, residual deficits, and recurrent vascular events.
   Aims
   This review summarizes current knowledge on post-hospital care and the scientific evidence supporting individual programs.
   Summary of review
   A systematic search of electronic databases according to PRISMA guidelines identified 10,374 articles, 77 of which met the inclusion criteria. One large randomised controlled trial on a multifaceted care program delivered by the multidisciplinary stroke team reduced recurrent vascular events and improved quality of life and functional outcome one year after the event, while a number of studies offer solutions for individual components of post-hospital disease management like patient education, counselling, and self-management or the management of post-stroke complications and residual deficits. A majority of studies, however, was small in size and limited by a short follow-up. Most initiatives with a narrow focus on risk factor control failed to lower the risk of recurrent events. The caregivers' central role in post-stroke patient management is broadly neglected in research.
   Conclusions
   Over the past years, first knowledge on how to best organize post-hospital care of stroke patients has emerged. Comprehensive and pragmatic programs operated by the multidisciplinary stroke team hold promise to reduce the long-term health burden of stroke. There is a clear need for further high-quality studies with both clinical endpoints and patient-reported outcomes to establish sustainable solutions in different settings and regions to improve life after stroke, a key priority of the Stroke Action Plan for Europe 2018-2030.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of permeable pavement systems (PPS), especially in the scope of stormwater management as a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS). In this study, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis followed by a systematic review were conducted to capture the nature and evolution of literature, intellectual structure networks, emerging themes, and knowledge gaps in the field of PPS. Relevant publications over 22 years (2000-2021) were retrieved from the Web of Science database for analysis. Results revealed that slight modifications within the PPS layers or incorporation of innovative filters could result in improved contaminant removal efficiency. Impermeable soils and PPS pore size were the main limiting factors affecting the permeability and infiltration rates. A combination of maintenance procedures was presented and proven effective in mitigating clogging effects, mostly occurring at the upper 1.5-2.5 cm of the PPS. Although partial replacement of the PPS mix design with recycled aggregates improved the overall permeability, the compressive strength was slightly compromised. The present study also discusses several evolving aspects for water quality improvements, innovative investigations that include recycled aggregates, and other lessons learned and future research directions in the area of PPS. Findings from the conducted analysis provide researchers, designers, urban planners, and even municipalities with research gaps and technical deficiencies in implementing and investigating PPS.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to discuss the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the effective assessment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) related to smart and sustainable city initiatives.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is based on a systematic review of the literature within the Web of Science and Scopus databases, comprising the studies about ICTs related to smart and sustainable city initiatives and sustainable assessment.
   Findings
   The main results point out that there are several different ways of assessing SDGs performance related to ICTs use in smart and sustainable city initiatives. However, the effectiveness of these assessments can be questioned. The intensive use of technology understood as the core of smart and sustainable cities does not imply an improvement in sustainability unless these technologies are strategically addressed to underpin those objectives. Moreover, not all SDGs have considered the use of ICTs in their targets.
   Research limitations/implications
   The scope of the study is limited to "how" the information is used and managed, rather than analysing the sustainable performance itself. As a limitation, the findings and conclusions do not consider other sources of studies, such as grey literature.
   Practical implications
   This study suggests some requirements for providing better and more reliable sustainable assessment, making smart and sustainable city initiatives more correlated with the SDGs.
   Social implications
   By acknowledging the difficulties associated with SDGs assessment, concerning the municipal level, the study offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of public policies and public management. Besides, the findings shed some light on if and how the use of ICTs can effectively enhance sustainable development issues.
   Originality/value
   This study offers valuable contributions to the literature by providing a collection of insights regarding how the ICTs may genuinely lead to a sound assessment of sustainable development, especially regarding the SDGs.

AB  - Nowadays the agrifood system requires major transformations aimed at promoting sustainability, reducing waste and stimulating a change toward healthy sustainable diets. The scientific literature on the transition to sustainable food models continues to develop rapidly and there is an urgent need to systematize its knowledge structure and thus make future research more vigorous. Recently, several studies have focused on certain aspects of supply chain, such as traceability or decision-making frameworks, but a systematic review of the role of sustainability within the agrifood supply has never been carried out. Through a bibliometric analysis combined with network and content analyses, the present study is aimed at identifying homogeneous areas in the field of agrifood supply chains, investigating the role of innovation technology in the transition to sustainability. The bibliometric results showed that sustainable agrifood supply chains are experiencing an evolving positive trend and represent a challenging research topic which is capturing the attention of scholars. From the network and overlay visualization of keyword co-occurrences four different research clusters were identified and the blockchain emerged as central topic in the field of food security and safety. The content analysis highlighted greater attention to the environmental pillar, compared to the economic and social pillars of the sustainability paradigm. A lack of studies was also observed on the post-consumption phase of the agrifood supply chain, which could represent a research gap to be fulfilled in the light of circular economy.

AB  - Agricultural productivity can be increased sustainably in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by reducing crop losses due to insect pest damage. As an alternative to environmentally-damaging chemical pesticides, biological control interventions and botanical pesticides show potential to achieve both high yields and profits. However, synthesized information of their performance and understanding of their adoption among smallholder farmers is limited. Here, 173 studies of biological control interventions and botanical pesticides of insect pests for 35 crops from 20 sub-Saharan countries from 2005 to 2021 were systematically reviewed. Drawing on published datasets, we found that cereals, particularly maize, were the most studied crop (59%). Research on botanical pesticides constituted 32% of the studies, followed by augmentation/introduction biocontrol (29%), and push-pull (21%). Studies evaluating the technical performance of biocontrol interventions dominated (73%), with a regional clustering of push-pull studies in Kenya. Few studies investigated each intervention on each crop type, across different farming contexts and scales, highlighting an urgent need for landscape-scale studies to elucidate land-use impacts on biocontrol effectiveness. Limited evidence also exists on the synergistic effects of biocontrol on multiple ecosystem services and on non-target/beneficial organisms. We found an absence of interdisciplinary studies that addressed the wider indirect benefits of not using chemical pesticides, the social-economic outcomes, and barriers to adoption by farmers, which we argue are necessary to identify pathways to greater adoption and to support policy advocacy of biocontrol interventions in SSA.

AB  - Context: The African genus Aframomum (Zingiberaceae) is a group of diverse tropical plants frequently collected yet largely neglected taxonomically. The current and unprecedented loss of species due to man-made habitat destruction and climate change adds a desperate urgency not only to understand the phylogenetics, chemotaxonomy and biology, but also to preserve the quickly disappearing species.Objectives: The present systematic review reports on the research progress in phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of Aframomum species.Methodology: Scientific databases such as MedSci, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Knowledge were used to retrieve publications (from the year 1990 to 2014) related to Aframomum plants, isolated compounds and their bioactivity, phytochemistry and toxicology. The keywords combinations for the search were: Aframomum; chemotaxonomy, phylogenetics, pharmacology and bioactive metabolites and toxicology. A total of 71 research articles that report on the biological activity of extracts and chemical constituents were recovered and presented in this review.Results: Most published data related to the potential of Aframomum melegueta, a medicinal plant from West and Central Africa. The potential of phenols and terpenoids isolated from Aframomum plants were generally much better documented than that of arylalkanoids.Conclusion:Aframomum genus represents an enormous resource for novel compounds with a range of medicinal properties. However, these plants are under-researched and their conservation is poor. To unravel their full potential, efforts should be strengthened throughout the continent to establish the taxonomy, preserve the genus and explore novel medicinal properties.

AB  - Objective: medically unexplained symptoms are common and associated with mental illness in various contexts. Previous studies show that Latin American populations are prone to somatization. Given the reformulation of the International Classification of Diseases towards its 11(th) edition the peculiarities of the population from this region of the world shall be taken into consideration. The objective of this study is to provide information on somatization in Latin American populations to help the decision making about medically unexplained symptoms diagnostic categories in the 11(th) edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Method: Extensive review of the academic production from 1995 to 2011 on somatization in populations of Latin American origin. Results: The analysis of 106 studies included in this review was divided into 15 categories: systematic reviews, conceptual reviews, prevalence, primary care, depression and anxiety, risk factors, violence, organic conditions, relationship with health care, ethnicity, culture-bound syndromes, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, body dysmorphic disorder, and conversion and dissociation. Conclusion: The Latin American studies confirm the difficulty in defining medically unexplained symptoms categories. The supposed "somatizing trace" of Latin cultures may be linked more to cultural and linguistic expression than to an ethnic nature, and these peculiarities must be on the agenda for the new classification of these phenomena in the Classification of Diseases-11th edition.

AB  - This paper was designed as a complement to a previous study to give deeper insights into the characteristics of scientific impact of Resources Conservation and Recycling (RCR) over the past 30 years. Our study brought transparency to the impact trends of RCR, the role of information amounts and contributors, and the evolution of research emphases. The results showed that RCR has become more mainstream with greater influence in the scientific community. International collaboration, inter-institutional collaboration and co-authorship made increasing contributions to the RCR publications, where the collaboration between the USA and China has been the most prominent one. Interestingly, single institution or single country publications were found to obtain more citations than those of inter-institutional and inter-national collaboration, which is nevertheless in line with the fact that many of the former were published earlier than the latter. While the comparative analysis of author keywords and Key Words Plus revealed the diversity and complexity of research focuses of RCR throughout the study period, RCR has retained its commitment to fueling the sustainability discourses that transcends various disciplinary boundaries. "Recycling" and "management" have long been the research focuses of RCR publications and their references. Overall, this paper presented a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of literature in RCR, which could serve as a reference for the journal editors, authors, reviewers, readers, the publisher, and those who are interested in the state of the art in relevant areas of research.

AB  - This systematic review of research used science mapping as a means of analyzing the knowledge base on education for sustainable development (ESD) in K-12 schooling. The review documented the size, growth trajectory and geographic distribution of this literature, identified high impact scholars and documents, and visualized the "intellectual structure" of the field. The database examined in this review consisted of 1842 English language, Scopus-indexed documents published between 1990 and 2018. The review found that the knowledge base on ESD has grown dramatically over the past 30 years, with a rapidly accelerating rate of publication in the past decade. Although the field has been dominated by scholarship from Anglo-American_European nations, there is evidence of increasing geographic diversification of the ESD knowledge base over the past 15 years. Citation analyses identified authors who have had a significant influence on the development of this literature. Author co-citation analysis revealed three "schools of thought" that comprise the "intellectual structure" of this knowledge base: Education for Sustainable Development, Developing a Sustainability Mindset, Teaching and Learning for Sustainability. Document content analyses led to the conclusion that the current knowledge base is heavily weighted towards critical, descriptive and prescriptive papers, with an insufficient body of analytical empirical studies. Several recommendations are offered for strengthening this literature.

AB  - Purpose This is a conceptual study to analyze the potential of enset-based culinary tourism for sustainable rural development and to obtain a place as a niche tourism market in South-Western Ethiopia. It assumed enset agro-biodiversity as the effect of ages of environment, genetic resources and cultural interaction as a distinctive regional image. Design/methodology/approach This an exploratory paper based on an in-depth interview, field observation and content analysis of documents. By means of in-depth interviews, the researchers managed to gather extended information from community elders and experts in culture and tourism offices selected based on a snowball technique. Besides, it has gone through systematic reviews of about 180 empirical and conceptual articles, books and conference papers with a critical reading of the content, identification of categories, examination and interpretation of ideas, to supplement the in-depth-interview. The thematic analysis applied to identify various ideas, concepts, categories and relationships to produce themes presented under discussion and results. Findings The study found enset-based culinary tourism not only improve the local economy and regional image, but also it would enhance conservation of traditional farming system, biodiversity, food heritages, genetic varieties and livestock. It also identified 18 enset food varieties compatible with the principle of balanced diets. Finally, the study advised rural development planners to consider enset-based culinary tourism so that it would revive lost food traditions and consumption patterns, enhance the regional heritage and destination branding. Research limitations/implications The research is a conceptual study that lacked empirical investigation concerning the livelihood impact, gender implication and actual tourist data. Therefore, future research needs to focus on the aforementioned limitations. Practical implications This study addressed SW Ethiopia, which is the primary center of Ensete ventricosum, and argued that enset-based culinary tourism would help to build regional image and obtain a place as a niche rural tourism destination. It would also contribute to the conservation of food heritages, environmentally sustainable farming system, soil conservation, crop diversities and livestock population in addition to producing tourist experience. Moreover, it would encourage the revival of traditional consumption, reinvent lost food traditions and identities. Social implications It was hoped that rural tourism would eventually improve the livelihood and enhance the capability of resilience. It is also expected to maintain the traditional social-economic structure based on the enset farm while fostering cultural development. Originality/value To the knowledge of the researchers there is no previous work on enset based-culinary tourism in Ethiopia and probably there is no published culinary tourism paper elsewhere.

AB  - Plant-animal interactions are pervasive in terrestrial ecosystems. They hold relevant ecological information for guiding biodiversity conservation and restoration practices. Despite plant-animal interactions being particularly sensitive to disturbance, the knowledge about how fire, a remarkable driver of changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, affects these relationships is still limited. In this sense, the assessment of how studies investigate the fire effects on plant-animal interactions through a systematic review proves to be relevant to guide future research agenda. In this study, we reviewed studies regarding the effects of fire on plant-animal interactions conducted in Brazil, which hosts many different fire-prone and fire-sensitive ecosystems and harbours several plant and animal species. Supported by an integrative database, we summarized the main goals, methodologies, and taxonomic groups used in studies addressing the effects of fire on plant-animal interactions and pointed out some shortfalls that future research should avoid and gaps that they shall fulfil. In sum, 39 studies published from 1995 to 2022 met our criteria of inclusion in the database. Most of them were conducted in Cerrado and mainly evaluated ant-plant or plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, studies were generally designed with inappropriate experimental approaches that commonly disregard relevant fire attributes that are important drivers of ecosystem structure and functioning. Altogether, our review shows that studies evaluating this topic present a geographic and taxonomic bias, which overlooks particular plant-animal interactions, and that we still have a superficial understanding of fire effects on plant-animal interactions in Brazilian ecosystems.

AB  - Among anthropogenic activities, marine seismic surveys are a fundamental tool for oil and gas explorations, geophysical research, environmental hazard, and risk analysis. This resulting noise may affect a range of species, eliciting masking, behavioral responses, and changes in acoustic repertoires. There is an urgency to understand in depth the potential effects of seismic surveys on marine ecosystems since the information available is still scarce. Using Scopus (R) and Web of Science (TM) 2023 Clarivate bibliographic databases, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature addressing seismic surveys' effects on free-ranging marine fauna. The first selection of articles matching selected keywords yielded 680 articles from Scopus and 320 from Web of Science. Screening for research articles written in English investigating marine fauna in its natural environment and performing a quality assessment process resulted in selecting 31 articles since 2001. We found a trend of increasing research efforts in this field with a decrease after 2020 and a broad spectrum of journals that hosted the publications (31 papers published in 12 journals). Although several taxa are investigated, most studies focused on effects on marine mammals. There is a lack of research on diverse animal taxa, and no research papers compare the effects on different taxa along the food chain. Behavioral and physiological effects are the most found by authors in the field. However, observed behavioral changes cannot always be uniquely attributed to the exposure to seismic surveys, as many authors report the influence of other variables (e.g., environmental conditions) during the observations.

AB  - Diseases passed to humans from animals (zoonoses) constitute 75% of emerging infectious diseases. Farmed animals are considered a high zoonotic risk, especially poultry and pigs as evidenced by recent outbreaks of avian and swine influenza. This review sought to collate recent knowledge of the disease risks from keeping pigs and chickens intensively and in close proximity to each other. Recent knowledge on influenza viruses compounds the public health concerns; no longer are concerns about "mixing vessel" hosts limited to pigs, but several other animal species too at a high level of probability-most notably chickens and humans. More generally, scientific literature establishing positive associations between intensive animal farming, human population growth, reduced biodiversity, and increased zoonoses risks is abundant. This includes the publication of relevant systematic reviews. The collected scientific evidence on this issue is clear: there is exceptionally strong evidence for a link between low animal welfare levels and high zoonotic risks, exacerbated by animal crowding, low genetic diversity, compromised hygiene, and high animal stress levels which compromise immune systems. Based on this evidence, further industrialized animal farms-especially poultry and pig farms or a mix thereof, and particularly in areas that already have a high concentration of farmed animals-should not generally be permitted to proceed. Instead, efforts should concentrate on supporting arable agriculture (or transitions toward this) and de-intensifying remaining animal farms, in alignment with One Health/One Welfare approaches within which animal health and welfare are integral parts of any farming operation. Among numerous other factors, this would involve reducing stocking densities down to 11 kg/m2 (around five chickens/m2) for meat chickens, and down to one pig/1.5 m2 for pigs (assuming a 100 kg pig).

AB  - The paper provides a systematic review and analysis of the current literature on big data (BD) applications in the context of food supply chain management (FSCM) in order to categorize the state-of-the-art research trends exploring the adoption and implementation of big data analytics (BDA) across different segments of food supply chain (FSC). The use of BDA brings the digital transformation of FSCs closer providing sustainable implications and added value to their operation. Harnessing BD's potential is becoming more and more relevant in addressing the constantly evolving complexities in food systems. However, the field of BD applications in the FSCM domain is severely fragmented and relatively "primitive". The present research is one of the earliest attempts to recognize and present a comprehensive analysis for the BD applications across different segments of FSC proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the role of BD in a data-driven FSCM environment. For the purposes of our research, we adopted the systematic literature review (SLR) method aiming at the identification of the dominant categories and themes within the research area. Based on the SLR findings, we propose a conceptual framework that captures the interconnection between FSC performance and BD applications by using the input-process-output (IPO) model within a data-driven FSCM context. The main research contribution lies on the thematic classification of relevant research, the conceptualization of this fragmented field, the development of a conceptual framework, and the presentation of a future research agenda pertaining to BD applications in a data-driven FSCM context.

AB  - Purpose The paper attempts to address the following research questions (RQs): RQ1: What are the main research topics within PSS research? RQ2: What are future trends for PSS research? Design/methodology/approach Twenty years of research (1999-2018) on product-service systems (PSS) produced a significant amount of scientific literature on the topic. As the PSS field is relatively new and fragmented across different disciplines, a review of the prior and relevant literature is important in order to provide the necessary framework for understanding current developments and future perspectives. This paper aims to review and organize research contributions regarding PSS. A machine-learning algorithm, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, has been applied to the whole literature corpus on PSS in order to understand its structure. Findings The adopted approach resulted in the definition of eight distinct and representative topics able to deal adequately with the multidisciplinarity of the PSS. Furthermore, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to summarize the state-of-the-art and limitations in the identified PSS research topics. Based on this critical analysis, major gaps and future research challenges are presented and discussed. Originality/value On the basis of the results of the topic landscape, the paper presents some potential research opportunities on PSSs. In particular, challenges, transversal to the eight research topics and related to recent technology trends and digital transformation, have been discussed.

AB  - With the threat of 'white pollution', the large-scale production and application of biodegradable plastics have become crucial. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the simplest and most used member of the polyhydroxyalkanoate family, with a uniform C-4 structural unit (C4H6O2). To reduce the impact of PHB on waste treatment, various recycling strategies have been developed for the tailored conversion of PHB to targeted chemicals and fuels. Given the special structural unit, PHB and its plastic forms have the potential to serve as a sustainable feedstock for producing a series of value-added chemicals and fuels, including (i) crotonic acid via pyrolysis, (ii) (R)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid via hydrolysis, (iii) propylene via depolymerization and decarboxylation, (iv) liquid fuels via deoxygenation and oligomerization, (v) n-biobutanol via catalytic hydrogenolysis, (vi) methyl crotonate via thermolysis and esterification, (vii) (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate methyl ester via catalytic methanolysis, and (viii) beta-aminobutyric acid via ammonolysis. This review article provides a systematic review focusing on the reaction pathways, primary applications and market potential of the target products, and the pros and cons of current bio-refineries in comparison with conventional petroleum refineries. The thermochemical processes developed for PHB degradation and polypropylene (a typical petroleum-derived plastic to be replaced by PHB) are also comprehensively evaluated to reveal the future opportunities and challenges of PHB's broad-scale production and utilization. PHB-derived chemicals and fuels have a mature market already, and it is confirmed that the tailored valorization of PHB is a promising pathway to expand the market and gain more environmental and energy benefits.

AB  - Global warming and the acute domestic air pollution in China have necessitated transition to a sustainable energy system away from coal-dominated energy production. Through a systematic review of the national policy documents, this study investigates the policy mix adopted by the Chinese government to facilitate its energy transition and how that policy mix has evolved between 1981 and 2020. The chronological analysis emphasizes two dimensions of temporal changes in the policy mix: (1) changes in the policy intensity and density, and (2) the shift in policy instrument combinations. The policy mix has evolved from a few authority-based instruments to the current response that has a large density of instruments with a good diversity of instrument types. The Chinese government imposes an increasing policy intensity on air pollution abatement and a decreasing policy intensity on renewable energy support, and experiments with innovative policy instruments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The evolutionary trajectory features layering new policy instruments, calibrating existing ones and some degree of policy replacement and sequencing. Overall, the study shows that the Chinese government has adopted a complex mix of policy instruments to abate emissions (e.g. carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide) in the coal-based energy system and to support renewable energy technologies. The study provides an in-depth understanding of Chinese policy design in the environment and energy fields and contributes to the public policy literature by filling a research gap - the comparative lack of empirical analyses on the temporal changes in the policy mixes.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) literature in the principal logistics and supply chain management journals, across a 20-year time frame.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a systematic literature review methodology. This methodology allows for the minimization of researcher bias and the maximization of reliability and replicability. The study's empirical validity is further enhanced by demonstrating high levels of inter-coder reliability across families of codes.
   Findings - The field of SSCM has evolved from a perspective and investigation of standalone research in social and environmental areas; through a corporate social responsibility perspective; to the beginnings of the convergence of perspectives of sustainability as the triple bottom line and the emergence of SSCM as a theoretical framework. While the SSCM research has become more theoretically rich and methodologically rigorous, there are numerous opportunities for further advancing theory, methodology, and the managerial relevance of future inquiries.
   Research limitations/implications - The trends and gaps identified through our analysis allow us to develop a cogent agenda to guide future SSCM research.
   Practical implications - The current perspectives of SSCM hold important implications for managers, by directing limited resources toward projects which intersect environmental and/or social performance, and economic performance.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a systematic, rigorous, and methodologically valid review of the evolution of empirical SSCM research across a 20-year time period.

AB  - Despite numerous initiatives and resources to save and protect the health and sexual rights of girls and women, the persistently high rate of unwanted pregnancy, abortion, and sexual violence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has remain a topical public health challenge. This study hypothesised that the continuous conspicuous omission of boys/men in the interventions to combat this menace could be a long-life impediment to the realisation of sustainable health for girls and women in the region. The study adopted a systematic review of extant population-based published studies from Scopus, Google Scholars, PubMed, EMBASE, and AJOL. Literature coverage included the post-United Nations' coordinated International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), Cairo, 1994, which marked the beginning of a massive campaign for women/girls sexual rights. The obtained qualitative data were appraised and synthesised towards spurring policy recommendations for gender balanced initiatives on the sexual and reproductive health rights in SSA. The study highlighted that unwanted pregnancy occurs only when a boy/man has unprotected sex with a girl/woman without considering her choice or rights. It is considered ironic that the dominant factors are boys and men but many enlightenment initiatives/campaigns are concentrated on girls and women. The study developed a schematic save-a-girl-child framework that illustrated the possible dividends inherent in the training of a boy-child to achieve a safer world for the girls/women. It recommends increase in the exposure of boys and men to sexual education and counselling, which can motivate them to be supporters of family planning, supporters of only wanted pregnancy, wanted fatherhood, marital fidelity, intimate partners' harmonious living rather than violence, and wife or partner empowerment.

AB  - We systematically reviewed current climate change literature in order to examine how multiple processes that affect human vulnerability have been studied. Of the 125 reviewed articles, 79 % were published after 2009. There are numerous concepts that point out to stressors other than climate change that were used in reviewed studies. These different concepts were used interchangeably, and they illustrate processes that act on different scales. Most widely used concepts included non-climatic (40 % of the articles), multiple stressors (38 %) and other factors (37 %). About 75 % of the studies either acknowledged or carefully analyzed the social and environmental context in which vulnerability is experienced. One-third of the studies recognized climate change-related stressors as the most important, one-third argued that stressors other than climate are more important, and the rest of the studies did not analyze the relative importance of the different processes. Interactions between different stressors were mentioned in 76 % and analyzed explicitly in 28 % of the articles. Our review shows that there are studies that analyze the social context of vulnerability within climate change-related literature and this literature is rapidly expanding. Reviewed studies point out that there are multiple interacting stressors, whose interlinkages need to be carefully analyzed and targeted by policies, which integrate adaptation to climate change and other stressors. In conclusion, we suggest that future studies should include analytical frameworks that reflect dissimilarities between different types of stressors, methodological triangulation to identify key stressors and analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales.

AB  - In this paper, a review of Indigenous engagement in renewable energy projects is conducted and the main elements of energy partnerships between stakeholders and Indigenous partners are discussed. In recent years, Canada has witnessed more significant Indigenous involvement in economic and energy development projects than ever before. For large-scale energy partnerships, the focus is on engagement, financial capital, community buy-in (readiness, and entrepreneurial and business skills), and benefits-sharing with community partners. Equity-ownership, reconciliation, and self-determination intersect with and impact the benefits and sustainability of energy projects, as they are interrelated in the framework of most energy partnerships. This paper illustrates policy disconnects in connection with partnership-making, social outcomes, and decision-making among Indigenous communities. Furthermore, findings from relevant literature explore the nuanced discourse on social implications and capacity challenges that interlink with climate adaptation and reconciliation when promoting large-scale renewable energy partnerships with Indigenous communities. Through a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, we found 80 relevant studies during the screening process, of which 33 were selected for the synthesis. Findings demonstrate that the Crown, energy companies, and community partners need to coordinate and collaborate closely to achieve energy security and sustainable renewable energy. The review suggests that Indigenous engagement in energy partnerships supports positive outcomes for social development and environmental protection among Indigenous communities. The literature suggests that when government and industry mentor in the project implementation process, important positive impacts on energy transitions, and self-sufficiency can be realized.

AB  - Complex movement patterns of pedestrian traffic, ranging from unidirectional to multidirectional flows, are frequently observed in major public infrastructure such as transport hubs. These multidirectional movements can result in increased number of conflicts, thereby influencing the mobility and safety of pedestrian facilities. Therefore, empirical data collection on pedestrians' complex movement has been on the rise in the past two decades. Although there are several reviews of mathematical simulation models for pedestrian traffic in the existing literature, a detailed review examining the challenges and opportunities on empirical studies on the pedestrians complex movements is limited in the literature. The overall aim of this study is to present a systematic review on the empirical data collection for uni- and multidirectional crowd complex movements. We first categorized the complex movements of pedestrian crowd into two general categories, namely, external governed movements and internal driven movements based on the interactions with the infrastructure and among pedestrians, respectively. Further, considering the hierarchy of movement complexity, we decomposed the externally governed movements of pedestrian traffic into several unique movement patterns including straight line, turning, egress and ingress, opposing, weaving, merging, diverging, and random flows. Analysis of the literature showed that empirical data were highly rich in straight line and egress flow while medium rich in turning, merging, weaving, and opposing flows, but poor in ingress, diverging, and random flows. We put emphasis on the need for the future global collaborative efforts on data sharing for the complex crowd movements.

AB  - As the dyad of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and innovation have gained greater attention from researchers, practitioners and policy makers, integration of sustainability and sustainable development paradigms to this dyad have become fundamental to sustain businesses' competitive advantage. A variety of I4.0 based innovations with several sustainability implications exists in the literature, but they largely address independent and distinct knowledge areas, which yields an opportunity to explore the interconnections of I4.0-innovation-sustainability nexus. Therefore, this research performs a systematic literature review to synthesize the nexus by investigating how a combination of I4.0 technologies and different types of innovations, could contribute to sustainable development thereby providing sustainability implications. Our review portfolio derived from three databases analyzed 58 journal articles that addressed the simultaneous links of I4.0-innovation-sustainability. The primary findings show that I4.0 results in various innovation types including process, product, business model, supply chain, organizational, open, and marketing innovations that advance triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability, circular economy (CE), sustainable business models (SBMs) and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). While most studies focus on process, product, and business model innovations with TBL and CE implications, more research is required to address the significant but overlooked areas such as open, organizational, and marketing innovations to advance business model sustainability and SDGs.

AB  - Research using salutogenic factors to promote health is extensive. Salutogenesis, and its core concept 'sense of coherence' (SOC), is a resource-oriented theory and framework, applicable in different contexts. Research combining health promotion and doctoral supervision in higher education is scarce. This article places research supervision in a broader context of sustainable working life by focusing on stress management. It is about health promotion in an area of research supervision, a new approach not described earlier. Research on supervision in general is extensive, focusing on co-generative mentoring, counselling and coaching. A new salutogenic model, 'The Collegial Model', is presented as an example of practical application. The aim of the present article is to introduce and discuss how the salutogenic theory and model of health can be applied to research supervision of postgraduate students. Knowledge about how SOC impacts health and learning has benefit from a systematic review on salutogenic research covering published papers from 1992 to 2003 and until today. 'The Collegial Model' examines fundamental characteristics of supervision related to ethics and sense of coherence: relations, communication, processes, reciprocity, reflection, learning, comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness and coherence. Principles for carrying out supervision 'the salutogenic way' are suggested. The conclusion is that doctoral supervision involves mutual learning processes between colleagues in the supervisory team. Supervision has to be theory driven, implying that supervisors could benefit from applying a salutogenic way of thinking and working, particularly in development of guidelines for research supervision.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to present the findings of an analysis of the environmentally sustainable policies and practices (ESPPs) used by independent and chain-affiliated hotels. The study aimed to ascertain the engagement of hotels with ESPPs and provide tentative evidence of their commitment towards meeting the expectations of environmentally conscious stakeholders.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used secondary data and content analysis to examine the ESPPs of a sample of 220 hotels in Melbourne, Australia. A systematic review was conducted of hotel websites to reveal, in a tabulated way, the range of reporting of environmental material provided by various rated hotels.
   Findings - This analysis suggests that environmentally friendly business practices are prominently displayed by the hotels sampled; however, independent non-chain affiliated hotels are yet to adopt ESPPs in any visible way.
   Originality/value - This study was broadly informed by stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984) and aimed to ascertain the engagement of hotels with ESPPs. While previous studies have focussed on chain hotels, this research involved a greater range of hotels of different profiles to highlight the mix of ESPPs across the hotel sector. Rather than merely examining the corporate websites of hotel companies, the research additionally examined ESPPs at the individual hotel property level, as this is where policies are implemented into practice. The extant literature to date has not studied the extent to which ESPPs are adopted by independent and chain-affiliated hotels at this level, and it is this research gap that the study addresses.

T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH

KW  - NEWBORN MORTALITY
AB  - Background Previous estimates have highlighted a large global burden of stillbirths, with an absence of reliable data from regions where most stillbirths occur. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) targets national stillbirth rates (SBRs) of 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births by 2030. We estimate SBRs and numbers for 195 countries, including trends from 2000 to 2015.
   Methods We collated SBR data meeting prespecified inclusion criteria from national routine or registration systems, nationally representative surveys, and other data sources identified through a systematic review, web-based searches, and consultation with stillbirth experts. We modelled SBR (>= 28 weeks' gestation) for 195 countries with restricted maximum likelihood estimation with country-level random effects. Uncertainty ranges were obtained through a bootstrap approach.
   Findings Data from 157 countries (2207 datapoints) met the inclusion criteria, a 90% increase from 2009 estimates. The estimated average global SBR in 2015 was 18 . 4 per 1000 births, down from 24 . 7 in 2000 (25 . 5% reduction). In 2015, an estimated 2 . 6 million (uncertainty range 2 . 4-3 . 0 million) babies were stillborn, giving a 19% decline in numbers since 2000 with the slowest progress in sub-Saharan Africa. 98% of all stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-income countries; 77% in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Progress in reducing the large worldwide stillbirth burden remains slow and insufficient to meet national targets such as for ENAP. Stillbirths are increasingly being counted at a local level, but countries and the global community must further improve the quality and comparability of data, and ensure that this is more clearly linked to accountability processes including the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Humanity inhabits a discursive landscape that stimulates our imaginations, guides and influences our behaviour, shapes our ideas of what is possible, and governs what we perceive as normal. The collective human imagination is currently dominated by a discourse of neoliberal capitalism that contributes to global sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss by framing nature as a resource to be exploited in service of perpetual growth in economic activity. Transformation towards flourishing, sustainable futures will not be possible without the transformation of this dominant discourse. Alternative discourses exist but little is known about how to proactively and ethically pursue the transformation of dominant discourses. In response, this paper develops a conceptual framework to guide an ethical practice of meaning-making towards discursive transformation. It introduces 'discursive entrepreneurship', defined as the practice of creating, performing, and transforming memes, stories, narratives, and discourses to promote a desired structure of the discursive landscape. Normative strategies for discursive entrepreneurship are identified from a systematic review of recent literature on how social-ecological stories, narratives, and discourses evolve and change. The paper clarifies the often-inconsistent terminology used to define these ideational concepts, arguing for a nested relationship between discourses, narratives, stories, and memes. Further, it shows how discursive entrepreneurs can engage in iterative strategies of deconstruction, reframing, construction, performance, connection, and collaboration to increase the chances that their meanings will reach audiences, be heard by them, be retold, and perhaps contribute to the emergence of inclusive, life-affirming discourses.

AB  - Unsustainable fisheries practices carried out in large parts of the Amazon, Tocantins, and Orinoco basins have contributed to the decline in the populations of the Amazon River dolphins (Inia spp.), considered Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Amazon River dolphin byproducts are often obtained through unregulated fisheries and from stranded and incidentally caught individuals that are traded for the flesh and blubber used for Calophysus macropterus fisheries, traditional and other medicinal purposes, and more recently for human consumption. To identify localities of use of Amazon River dolphins, we conducted a systematic review of the related literature published since 1980, complemented with structured surveys of researchers that allowed the identification of 57 localities for uses of Inia (33 in the Amazon, two in the Tocantins, and 22 in the Orinoco basins), and two more on the Brazilian Atlantic coast, with recent reports of targeted consumption in the upper Orinoco River. Subsequently, the localities of use or bushmeat markets where Amazon River dolphin byproducts are trafficked were identified. This information was integrated with a kernel density analysis of the distribution of the Inia spp. populations establishing core areas. Our spatial analysis indicated that the use of Inia spp. is geographically widespread in the evaluated basins. It is urgent that decision-makers direct policies towards mitigating the socioeconomic and cultural circumstances associated with illegal practices affecting Amazon River dolphin populations in South America.

Design/methodology/approach The research was carried out in two phases; multi-method was employed. The first phase mainly includes a systematic review to convene comprehensive knowledge of widespread GHRM practices to leverage environmental sustainability. In the second phase, the AHP and fuzzy AHP (FAHP) were employed to examine the influence of the respective dimension of GHRM practices toward environmental sustainability. Findings This study emphasizes the status of GHRM practices such as green recruitment and green selection, green performance management, green training and development, green compensation and rewards, green welfare aspects as a way to aid environmental issues. The findings suggest that these initiatives help to leverage environmental sustainability. Further, this paper reveals that green compensation and rewards have the highest impact on leveraging environmental sustainability. However, this study also emphasizes the comparative study of GHRM dimensions through AHP and FAHP. Originality/value As existing studies reveal, there is least research carried on this field of study and no study was conducted using AHP and FAHP in this field. Thus, this study reveals the necessity to discover the degree of concern toward GHRM practices in context to India.

AB  - IntroductionConflict, fragility and political violence, that are taking place in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have devastating effects on health. Digital health technologies can contribute to enhancing the quality, accessibility and availability of health care services in fragile and conflict-affected states of the MENA region. To inform future research, investments and policy processes, this scoping review aims to map out the evidence on digital health in fragile states in the MENA region. MethodWe conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines. We conducted descriptive analysis of the general characteristics of the included papers and thematic analysis of the key findings of included studies categorized by targeted primary users of different digital health intervention. ResultsOut of the 10,724 articles identified, we included 93 studies. The included studies mainly focused on digital health interventions targeting healthcare providers, clients and data services, while few studies focused on health systems or organizations managers. Most of the included studies were observational studies (49%). We identified no systematic reviews. Most of the studies were conducted in Lebanon (32%) followed by Afghanistan (13%) and Palestine (12%). The first authors were mainly affiliated with institutions from countries outside the MENA region (57%), mainly United Kingdom and United States. Digital health interventions provided a platform for training, supervision, and consultation for health care providers, continuing education for medical students, and disease self-management. The review also highlighted some implementation considerations for the adoption of digital health such as computer literacy, weak technological infrastructure, and privacy concerns. ConclusionThis review showed that digital health technologies can provide promising solutions in addressing health needs in fragile and conflict-affected states. However, rigorous evaluation of digital technologies in fragile settings and humanitarian crises are needed to inform their design and deployment.

AB  - Objective: Cervical cancer prevention shows a variability across Italian Regions unjustified by available evidence, increasing the health, economic and organizational burden. Evidence-based recommendations on topics not covered by international guidelines are needed to tackle existing inequalities. This article describes the rationale, methods, and process for development of the Multisociety Italian Guidelines for cervical cancer prevention. Methods: The Italian legislative framework requires guidelines to be consistent with methodological standards set by the National System for Guidelines (SNLG) of the National Institute of Health. Results: The nine scientific societies involved in cervical cancer prevention participated to the project, including clinicians, policy makers, methodologists, and researchers. Patients were involved as full voting panel members. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was adopted to assess the certainty of evidence collected by systematic reviews. The GRADE Evidenceto-Decision framework (EtD) was used to structure the appraisal of evidence and to formulate final recommendations. The EtD and a conflict-of-interests management policy were adopted to minimize the influence of competing interests. Discussion: Full transparency guided the reporting of each step of the process, to support the implementation of recommendations in each context and the future updating process. Considerations for subgroups, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of recommendations and research priorities were also provided. A two-step review process by external experts and SNLG reviewers, prior to online publication, ensured the methodological robustness underlying final recommendations. Finally, to increase publication timeliness, guidelines are organised in chapters that group sets of related recommendations to be published independently.

AB  - Context For many organisms, responses to climate change (CC) will be affected by land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC). However, the extent to which LULCC is concurrently considered in climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) is unclear. Objectives We identify trends in inclusion of LULCC and CC in vulnerability assessments of species and the direction and magnitude of their combined effect on biodiversity. Further, we examine the effect size of LULCC and CC in driving changes in "currencies" of response to CC, such as distribution, abundance and survival. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the last 30 years that focused on CCVA and accounted for impacts of both CC and LULCC. Results Across 116 studies, 34% assumed CC and LULCC would act additively, while 66% allowed for interactive effects. The majority of CCVAs reported similar effect sizes for CC and LULCC, although they affected different CCVA currencies. Only 14% of the studies showed larger effects of CC than of LULCC. Another 14% showed larger effects of LULCC than CC, specifically for dispersal, population viability, and reproduction, which tend to be strongly affected by fragmentation and disturbance. Although most studies found that LULCC and CC had negative effects on species currencies, in some cases effects were neutral or even positive. Conclusions CCVAs that incorporate LULCC provided a better account of drivers of vulnerability, and highlight aspects of drivers that are generally more amenable to on-the-ground management intervention than CCVAs that focus on CC alone.

AB  - Despite the general recognition that fragmentation can reduce forest biomass through edge effects, a systematic review of the literature does not reveal a clear role of edges in modulating biomass loss. Additionally, the edge effects appear to be constrained by matrix type, suggesting that landscape composition has an influence on biomass stocks. The lack of empirical evidence of pervasive edge-related biomass losses across tropical forests highlights the necessity for a general framework linking landscape structure with aboveground biomass. Here, we propose a conceptual model in which landscape composition and configuration mediate the magnitude of edge effects and seed-flux among forest patches, which ultimately has an influence on biomass. Our model hypothesizes that a rapid reduction of biomass can occur below a threshold of forest cover loss. Just below this threshold, we predict that changes in landscape configuration can strongly influence the patch's isolation, thus enhancing biomass loss. Moreover, we expect a synergism between landscape composition and patch attributes, where matrix type mediates the effects of edges on species decline, particularly for shade-tolerant species. To test our conceptual framework, we propose a sampling protocol where the effects of edges, forest amount, forest isolation, fragment size, and matrix type on biomass stocks can be assessed both collectively and individually. The proposed model unifies the combined effects of landscape and patch structure on biomass into a single framework, providing a new set of main drivers of biomass loss in human-modified landscapes. We argue that carbon trading agendas (e.g., REDD+) and carbon-conservation initiatives must go beyond the effects of forest loss and edges on biomass, considering the whole set of effects on biomass related to changes in landscape composition and configuration.

AB  - We set out to determine effectiveness of interventions for improving the quality of services provided by specialized drug shops in sub-Saharan Africa.
   We searched PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Eldis databases and websites for organizations such as WHO and Management Sciences for Health. Finally, we searched manually through the references of retrieved articles.
   Our search strategy included randomized trials, time-series studies and before and after studies evaluating six interventions; education, peer review, reorganizing administrative structures, incentives, regulation and legislation.
   We extracted information on design features, participants, interventions and outcomes assessed studies for methodological quality, and extracted results, all using uniform checklists.
   We obtained 10 studies, all implementing educational interventions. Outcome measures were heterogeneous and included knowledge, communication and dispensing practices. Education improved knowledge across studies, but gave mixed results on communication between sellers and clients, dispensing of appropriate treatments and referring of patients to health facilities. Profit incentives appeared to constrain behaviour change in certain instances, although cases of shops adopting practices at the expense of sales revenue were also reported.
   Evidence suggests that knowledge and practices of pharmacies and drug shops can be improved across a range of diseases and countries/regions, although variations were reported across studies. Profit incentives appear to bear some influence on the level of success of interventions. More work is required to extend the geographical base of evidence, investigate cost-effectiveness and evaluate sustainability of interventions over periods longer than 1 year.

AB  - Demographics will increase the demand for food and reduce the availability of labour in many countries all over the world. Moreover, scarcity of natural resources, climate change and food waste these are issues that are strongly impacting the agricultural sector and undermining sus-tainability. Digitalisation is expected to be a driving force in tackling these problems that are characterising agriculture. In particular, the adoption of digital technologies to support processes in the primary sector goes by the name of Agriculture 4.0. Although the number of contributions related to these issues is constantly growing, several areas are still unexplored or not fully addressed. This paper addresses the adoption of digital technologies and investigates the appli-cation domain of these technologies, presenting a systematic review of the literature on this subject. Moreover, this research shed light on the technologies adopted and related benefits. Hence, the research has turned its attention to the description of the main pillars, such as the categorisation of its main application domains and enabling technologies. The results of the research show that the different technologies applied in the various fields of application provide benefits both in terms of efficiency (cost reduction, farm productivity) and reduced environ-mental impact and increased sustainability.

AB  - Due to its obvious advantages in saving labor and pesticides, weeding robots are one of the key technologies for modern and sustainable agriculture and have attracted increasing attention from researchers and developers. Some papers on machine-vision-based weeding robots have been published in recent years, yet there is no clear attempt to systematically study these papers to discuss the components of a robotic weed control system, such as visual navigation, weed detection and directional weeding. In this paper, typical machine-vision-based weeding robots proposed or constructed in the last 30 years, together with a few open datasets for weed detection, are reviewed. Key technologies such as image preprocessing, image segmentation, navigation line extraction, and weed recognition based on machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) for weeding robots are discussed. To illustrate the application of DL algorithms to weed detection, this paper provides weed object detection results and a comparative analysis of eight baseline methods based on DL using a public dataset. The study found that there are still many issues that need to be addressed in each part of the robotic weeding control system. Because of environmental variation and system complexity, machine-vision-based weeding robots are still in their early stages. The results of the systematic review provide an understanding of innovative trends in the use of machine vision in weeding systems and references for future research on weeding robots.

AB  - Intermediary actors have been proposed as key catalysts that speed up change towards more sustainable sociotechnical systems. Research on this topic has gradually gained traction since 2009, but has been complicated by the inconsistency regarding what intermediaries are in the context of such transitions and which activities they focus on, or should focus on. We briefly elaborate on the conceptual foundations of the studies of intermediaries in transitions, and how intermediaries have been connected to different transition theories. This shows the divergence and sometimes a lack of conceptual foundations in this research. In terms of transitions theories, many studies connect to the multi-level perspective and strategic niche management, while intermediaries in technological innovation systems and transition management have been much less explored. We aim to bring more clarity to the topic of intermediaries in transitions by providing a definition of transition intermediaries and a typology of five intermediary types that is sensitive to the emergence, neutrality and goals of intermediary actors as well as their context and level of action. Some intermediaries are specifically set up to facilitate transitions, while others grow into the role during the process of socio-technical change. Based on the study, as an important consideration for future innovation governance, we argue that systemic and niche intermediaries are the most crucial forms of intermediary actors in transitions, but they need to be complemented by a full ecology of intermediaries, including regime-based transition intermediaries, process intermediaries and user intermediaries.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to provide a bibliometric review and visualisation analysis of the literature on Sustainable Stock Indices (SSI) between January 2001 and March 2022. The purpose of performing this bibliometric analysis is to empirically report the trend, intellectual structure, knowledge development directions and identify prospective research topics in the area of SSI. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 222 publications were selected after evaluating, identifying and synthesising the extensive publications using the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The articles were extracted from the databases of SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The study uses VOSviewer and RStudio software to answer four research questions.Findings - The results signify that there has been a considerable increase in the level of research considering SSI. Further, the study shows that SSI is among the top five trending keywords in the research related to finance and environment. Most papers considered as a sample for this study are based on Dow Jones Sustainable Indices. Noteworthy, very few economies are participating in this research domain, and the significant contribution is from the developed countries.Practical implications - The present review paper may assist the researchers in identifying the trending research topics in this domain. It may serve as a roadmap for several further studies in the area. Originality/value - This study is unique in terms of reviewing the literature based on SSI. Further, it provides a holistic view of the current trend, global position and research hotspots of SSI, which has important implications for future research.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the most and least commonly cited security management messages that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are communicating to their field staff, to determine the types of documentation that NGOs most often use to communicate key security messages, and to distinguish the points of commonality and divergence across organizations in the content of key security messages.
   Methods: The authors undertook a systematic review of available security policies, manuals, and training materials from 20 international humanitarian NGOs using the InterAction Minimum Operating Security Standards as the basis for a review framework.
   Results: The most commonly cited standards include analytical security issues such as threat and risk assessment processes and guidance on acceptance, protection, and deterrence approaches. Among the least commonly cited standards were considering security threats to national staff during staffing decision processes, incorporating security awareness into job descriptions, and ensuring that national staff security issues are addressed in trainings. NGO staff receive security-related messages through multiple document types, but only 12 of the 20 organizations have a distinct security policy document. Points of convergence across organizations in the content of commonly cited standards were found in many areas, but differences in security risk and threat assessment guidance may undermine communication between aid workers about changes in local security environments.
   Conclusions: Although the humanitarian community has experienced significant progress in the development of practical staff security guidance during the past 10 years, gaps remain that can hinder efforts to garner needed resources, clarify security responsibilities, and ensure that the distinct needs of national staff are recognized and addressed.

AB  - Goal: The need to discuss reverse logistics processes with a detailed and analytical approach, aiming at improving the reverse channel efficiency is notorious in the literature. Therefore, this research aimed to analyze and describe in detail the activities that make up the reverse logistics processes and, in addition, to propose a conceptual framework for a better understanding and definition of RL processes.
   Design / Methodology / Approach: This was achieved through a systematic review, which considered 3.517 papers, analyzing the RL concepts, definitions and objectives, as well as identifying its processes and activities. The activities were categorized as information (I-RL process) or materials (M-RL process) related.
   Results: This research provides an entire RL activities blueprint. This approach promotes greater transparency, allowing to identify stages most impacted on the reverse channels, besides standardizing logistical procedures and also allowing to insert control points for measuring performance.
   Limitations of the investigation: It is possible for a paper that focuses on one of the activities of the framework not to have been shown during the database if it doesn't mention the keywords "reverse logistics", "green logistics" and "sustainable logistics".
   Practical implications: The concepts of reverse logistics activities presented in the framework can be implemented in reverse supply chains, serving as a basis for organizational strategies for managers involved with such processes.
   Originality / Value: The authors of this paper believe that the results achieved can greatly contribute to the expansion of debates in the RL area, as well as serve as a basis for managers involved with RL processes.

AB  - The bird fauna of West Africa region is of highest conservation value, including 1371 species, three primary Endemic Bird Areas (EBA), eight secondary EBAs and 331 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs). The aims of this review arc to systematically identify and collate studies focusing on the ornithology in the region. We carried out a Google Scholar search using as keywords the habitat types available in the region (mangrove, rainforest, Guinea savannah, Sudanese savannah, Sahel), the name of the countries in the region, and six ornithological disciplinary sectors in turn (`Community Ecology', "Taxonomy', 'Population Biology', `Conservation Biology', 'Pollution effects', and 'Climate Change effects'). Four countries (with Nigeria on the top) were subjected to much more ornithological investigations than the other countries. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were the least studied countries. Although the number of ornithological studies increased remarkably in the last years, the relative scientific effort remained stable across countries either before or after 2006. In terms of habitat, studies on rainforest ornithology were more numerous than studies from other habitat types. Ornithological studies by disciplinary sector showed a slight prevalence of studies on population biology and climate change effects on birds. The overall implications of the observed patterns are dis-cussed.

TI  - A model for scale up of family health innovations in low-income and middle-income settings: a mixed methods study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
LA  - English
KW  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Many family health innovations that have been shown to be both efficacious and cost-effective fail to scale up for widespread use particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Although individual cases of successful scale-up, in which widespread take up occurs, have been described, we lack an integrated and practical model of scale-up that may be applicable to a wide range of public health innovations in LMIC.
   Objective: To develop an integrated and practical model of scale-up that synthesises experiences of family health programmes in LMICs.
   Data sources: We conducted a mixed methods study that included in-depth interviews with 33 key informants and a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature from 11 electronic databases and 20 global health agency web sites.
   Study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions: We included key informants and studies that reported on the scale up of several family health innovations including Depo-Provera as an example of a product innovation, exclusive breastfeeding as an example of a health behaviour innovation, community health workers (CHWs) as an example of an organisational innovation and social marketing as an example of a business model innovation. Key informants were drawn from non-governmental, government and international organisations using snowball sampling. An article was excluded if the article: did not meet the study's definition of the innovation; did not address dissemination, diffusion, scale up or sustainability of the innovation; did not address low-income or middle-income countries; was superficial in its discussion and/or did not provide empirical evidence about scale-up of the innovation; was not available online in full text; or was not available in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese, resulting in a final sample of 41 peer-reviewed articles and 30 grey literature sources.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis to extract recurrent themes from the interviews, and we integrated these themes with findings from the literature review to generate the proposed model of scale-up. For the systematic review, screening was conducted independently by two team members to ensure consistent application of the predetermined exclusion criteria. Data extraction from the final sample of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted independently by two team members using a pre-established data extraction form to list the enabling factors and barriers to dissemination, diffusion, scale up and sustainability.
   Results: The resulting model-the AIDED model-includes five non-linear, interrelated components: (1) assess the landscape, (2) innovate to fit user receptivity, (3) develop support, (4) engage user groups and (5) devolve efforts for spreading innovation. Our findings suggest that successful scale-up occurs within a complex adaptive system, characterised by interdependent parts, multiple feedback loops and several potential paths to achieve intended outcomes. Failure to scale up may be attributable to insufficient assessment of user groups in context, lack of fit of the innovation with user receptivity, inability to address resistance from stakeholders and inadequate engagement with user groups.
   Limitations: The inductive approach used to construct the AIDED model did not allow for simultaneous empirical testing of the model. Furthermore, the literature may have publication bias in which negative studies are under-represented, although we did find examples of unsuccessful scale-up. Last, the AIDED model did not address long-term, sustained use of innovations that are successfully scaled up, which would require longer-term follow-up than is common in the literature.
   Conclusions and implications of key findings: Flexible strategies of assessment, innovation, development, engagement and devolution are required to enable effective change in the use of family health innovations in LMIC.

AB  - Water supply is strategic for the development of society. The water distribution in nature follows patterns linked to geographic and territorial issues. Climate fluctuations aggravate shortage problems in semi-arid regions. This study aims to develop a systematic review of research on water scarcity in semi-arid areas through bibliometric methods that allow the analysis of its structure, performance, evolution, and future trends. The methodology considers three phases: (i) literature review, (ii) data cleaning and processing, and (iii) analysis of the research field and future trends. The intellectual structure of water scarcity in semi-arid zones covers 2206 documents with the collaboration of sixty-one countries, distributed in studies carried out in 54 years (1967 to 2021). This field of research has been growing, especially since the 21st century (93.1% of the documents). The countries that study the issue the most are those with high population rates and large consumption patterns, such as the United States and China. There are two central areas of interest led by the terms "water scarcity" and "water stress" due to the intensive use of the resource for agriculture and the management of the water-energy-climate nexus. Thus, the most significant journals studied relate remote sensing to resource management, and the most cited are related to agriculture. This research made it possible to consider future topics such as the study of anthropogenic effects and climate change, the accuracy and applicability of models, and future trends in conventional and unconventional agriculture and resources.

AB  - The importance of electric vehicles (EVs) lies in the fact that they are seen as a key solution to the climate change problem. In the last decade, this topic has received significant interest from the scientific community, contributing to publications in different areas. However, the existing literature is fragmented, and efforts have not been made to categorize and analyze it from a freight logistics perspective. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic literature review (SLR) of the potential impacts of EVs on sustainable road-freight transport operations, including in urban areas. We reviewed 237 peer-reviewed articles for bibliometric and literature classification analysis, whereby 119 articles were subsequently studied for content analysis and research gaps related to sustainability approaches. The bibliometric analysis showed significant growth in the body of research in the past two years, reflected in the number of journal papers, authors, and references. In the literature and keywords analysis, we identified five main categories and research areas: economic and competitive aspects, city logistics, environmental sustainability, vehicle fleet operations, and infrastructure and technology. In addition, this paper revealed eight key research gaps for future research: multimodal integration, long-haul and heavy-duty truck approaches, emerging economies, business models, social factors, charging infrastructure inclusion, and fleet replacement policies. These findings can enlighten researchers and practitioners toward sustainable research and real-life applications of electromobility in freight logistics.

AB  - Bamboos are considered to be non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Habitat of Bamboos are distributed across the world except in extremely cold areas such as the Atlantic and some European regions. Since ancient times, Bamboos have been playing a significant role in preparation of therapeutics, especially in Asian countries like China, Japan, and India. Bamboo possesses high macro and micro nutrients such as protein, fiber, essential minerals and amino acids. Bamboo-derived products have high demand in the market, such as bamboo-salt, bamboo-dietary silica, bamboo-charcoal soap, bamboo-tea, Banslochan, bamboo-vinegar, and many more. These Bamboo products have been used to treat various health problems such as, obesity, inflammation, heart disease, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, etc. Scope of present review is to compile existing information relevant to Bamboo products, medicinal importance, and its industrial applications. Literature was gathered from peer reviewed journals, websites, books, thesis, and scientific reports from 1995 to 2022. The distribution and characteristics of bamboo species that are used as medicinal plants, their chemical composition, and different methods used for making different bamboo products were reviewed. The distribution pattern of different bamboo genus, including Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, Gigantochloa, Phyllostachys, and Sasa were also a part of the present review. Present study comprehensively illustrates the utilization of various bamboos species having medicinal/ therapeutic potentials and recommendation to commercialize the bamboo products for future prospectus.

KW  - SEA-LEVEL
AB  - Venice is suffering from flooding, pollution and the neglect of its famous urban fabric. The situation will worsen with sea-level rise relative to the land, as the Lagoon continues to evolve from a low-energy coastal marsh to a high-energy marine system. The proposed solution - a system of mobile gates - appears to be flawed in that it does not tackle some of the fundamental causes of these problems, or cope adequately with sealevel rise. For sustainability, what is needed is a more systematic review of policy options and communications. The authors' initial assessment suggests that what is required is, first, a medium-to long-term integrated catchment and;coastal zone plan, implemented over 50 years or more, to tackle the pollution and the Lagoon's degraded morphology. Second, in the short to medium term (the next 50 years) small-scale local floodproofing works within Venice - designed to maintain the visual integrity of the city and be acceptable to its people - can alleviate much of the flooding, while the more long-term solution is implemented. That solution must involve the progressive reduction of the influence of the Adriatic on the Lagoon, to cushion against the flooding that it brings. To succeed, this approach will need new thinking, and new resources, skills and institutional arrangements.

AB  - Recently, new agricultural technologies have emerged to increase sustainable food production, often referred to as "Agriculture 4.0." They consist of more advanced precision agriculture technologies, such as sensors, robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can lead to environmental and economic benefits for farmers and society. Despite the potential benefits of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, the adoption rate remains low. The objective of this study was to gain insight into the factors affecting the adoption of agricultural field robotics and UAVs using a systematic literature review approach that analyzed 23 relevant studies identified from two scientific databases (i.e., Web of Science and Scopus). Data regarding methodological aspects and results were extracted. Even though the current adoption of agricultural robots and UAVs is still limited, farmers seem highly interested. Most studies have used a quantitative approach to study the intention to adopt or the adoption of robotics or UAVs. Surprisingly, few studies have used an existing theory to explain the (intended) adoption. Age, gender, income, education, farm size, perceived usefulness, expected economic and environmental benefits, an attitude of confidence, and the perceived ease of use have been the internal factors most often identified. Meanwhile, the price of the technology, compatibility with other software and equipment, and labor scarcity are the most important external factors.

AB  - In recent years, smart cities have emerged with energy conservation systems for managing energy in cities as well as buildings. Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the "bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)" are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.

AB  - Aims
   This study aimed to systematically review intervention studies on self-management of type 2 diabetes in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to determine the most effective self-management strategies for individuals with type 2 diabetes in this region.
   Methods
   A search strategy was developed using multiple databases: Medline and Embase (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and PubMed. Study and intervention characteristics, intervention structure, content, cultural adaptation, and outcomes were extracted from the included studies. To be included in the review the studies should have met the following criteria: have examined the effectiveness of at least one intervention involving a type 2 DSME programme, have involved participants over 18 years old diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, have taken place to in a GCC country, have a study design that was observational, quasi-experimental or controlled, have reported at least one individual and have a quantitative outcome. A narrative data synthesis was used to describe the studies and comment on their methodological quality.
   Results
   Of the 737 retrieved papers, only eight met the inclusion criteria. Only one study was a randomised controlled trial. A statistically significant improvement in HbA1c was reported in five of the eight studies. There was a significant improvement in physical activity levels as reported in four of the eight studies. Only three studies referred to aspects of cultural design or adaptation of the intervention implemented.
   Conclusions
   Self-management interventions may have a positive impact on HbA1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes in the GCC area. A greater emphasis placed on culturally appropriate self-management programmes may improve the effectiveness of self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes in the GCC.

AB  - PurposeWaste generated from electrical and electronic equipment, collectively known as E-waste, remains a persistent environmental, economic and social problem. Sustainable E-waste management (EWM) has numerous benefits, such as preventing electronic waste from entering landfills, reducing the need for virgin materials by recovering valuable materials from recycling and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Circular economy (CE) practices are considered the initial steps toward sustainable EWM, but some hurdles have been reported in the adoption of these practices. Therefore, the current study aims to identify the common CE practices, sustainability of the EWM process and the challenges in EWM, and to develop a conceptual framework for effective EWM.Design/methodology/approachVery few studies have proposed frameworks that acknowledge the challenges and CE practices of EWM. To fill this gap, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed, and 169 research articles were explored.FindingsA total of seven challenges in the adoption of effective EWM were identified: rules and policy, infrastructure, consumer behaviour, informal sectors, community culture, technology and economy. Eight common CE practices were also found for effective EWM: reuse, recycle, remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair, reduce, recover and repurpose.Originality/valueA conceptual framework guiding sustainable EWM was proposed, which includes solutions for the identified challenges, and CE practices with sustainable benefits.

AB  - Rural tourism has been a key research area over the last few decades. However, evaluating the advancement of its dimensions as a systematic and comprehensive audit was long overdue. This study performed a bibliometric analysis on 404 articles from 1980 to 2019 and revealed that rural tourism has maximum growth in the last two decades. Deductive and quantitative methods are the principally implemented theoretical and methodical approaches, respectively. The developed countries have majorly contributed from 1980 to 1999, while the last two decades the developing nations have contributed. The rural tourism research in the developed world has matured by debating critical issues such as community politics, power struggle, resource control, whereas these issues along with several new issues, such as climate change and epidemic, have ample scope in future especially in the context of Eastern World. This study offers an insight into the evolution of conceptual framework, authorship, institution-specific productivity, spatial distribution of study areas, crucial themes, and the future research directions. The present findings will work as a comprehensive reference to the potential research dimensions and add to the existing knowledge body of the tourism research in general and the rural tourism research in particular.

AB  - Precision agriculture and Smart farming have become the essential backbone for sustainable agricultural production by leveraging cutting edge remote sensing and communication technologies, meshed with AI driven data processing and decision making approaches. Agricultural segments, such as crop and livestock monitoring, crop/ plant classification, yield prediction, weed detection, automatic harvesting, early detection, and prevention of diseases are being served for efficient, cost-effective process monitoring with increased profitability. With the remarkable development in recent decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based remote sensing technologies have gained rapid proliferation and exploitation in precision agriculture. Consequently, over the past decades, researchers have explored the capabilities of UAVs for real-time imagery data acquisition and processing through powerful Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to optimize agricultural process management. Being a prevalent research domain of high-tech field with constant advancement, there is a need for systematic review to recapitulate the contemporary literature and reveal the domain's intellectual structure.This systematic literature review (SLR) research has methodically scrutinized 214 peer reviewed articles on the concerned domain that are published in ranked journals and conferences over the past 14 years. Several pressing dimensions are investigated, including, the feasibility assessment of the UAVs in precision agriculture, determine the impact of imaging modalities and imagery datasets in relation to agricultural applications, categorically evaluate the UAV configuration and offer detailed scrutiny of AI methods in relation to real-time control, decision making and action performance in agricultural applications. Alongside, the taxonomy of crops across the world is documented for which UAV is utilized. Finally, the main challenges and directions of future research along the track is presented.

AB  - People affected by conflict are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks and climate change, yet little is known about climate change adaptation in fragile contexts. While climate events are one of the many contributing drivers of conflict, feedback from conflict increases vulnerability, thereby creating conditions for a vicious cycle of conflict. In this study, we carry out a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, taking from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) dataset to documenting climate change adaptation occurring in 15 conflict-affected countries and compare the findings with records of climate adaptation finance flows and climate-related disasters in each country. Academic literature is sparse for most conflict-affected countries, and available studies tend to have a narrow focus, particularly on agriculture-related adaptation in rural contexts and adaptation by low-income actors. In contrast, multilateral and bilateral funding for climate change adaptation addresses a greater diversity of adaptation needs, including water systems, humanitarian programming, and urban areas. Even among the conflict-affected countries selected, we find disparity, with several countries being the focus of substantial research and funding, and others seeing little to none. Results indicate that people in conflict-affected contexts are adapting to climate change, but there is a pressing need for diverse scholarship across various sectors that documents a broader range of adaptation types and their results.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity is related to several environmental imbalances, including dust. Particulate matter can also hinder humans with numerous health consequences, such as asthma, cancer, and pneumoconiosis. With a particular focus on mineral dust, this review is intended to determine in which circumstances occupational exposure occurs in the mining and earthmoving industries. Research followed the guidelines provided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols and its extension for scoping reviews. Of the 8993 records identified, only 24 passed both exclusion and inclusion criteria. Within the pool of results, it was possible to identify the following variables related to dust exposure: job-related (activity, job category, and site), engineering (equipment, transport system), technical (distance), and physical (season and weather) variables. Due to the significant variance in protocol settings, it was challenging to perform a general analysis, resulting in a study-by-study approach. The most significant conclusion of this study is not related to the setting of occupational exposure, although it derives from it. The necessity of adopting standard procedures for data collection, independent of research objective, was demonstrated within the context of occupational exposure to mineral dust.

AB  - Viruses play a primary role as etiological agents of pandemics worldwide. Although there has been progress in identifying the molecular features of both viruses and hosts, the extent of the impact these and other factors have that contribute to interspecies transmission and their relationship with the emergence of diseases are poorly understood. The objective of this review was to analyze the factors related to the characteristics inherent to RNA viruses accountable for pandemics in the last 20 years which facilitate infection, promote interspecies jump, and assist in the generation of zoonotic infections with pandemic potential. The search resulted in 48 research articles that met the inclusion criteria. Changes adopted by RNA viruses are influenced by environmental and host-related factors, which define their ability to adapt. Population density, host distribution, migration patterns, and the loss of natural habitats, among others, have been associated as factors in the virus-host interaction. This review also included a critical analysis of the Latin American context, considering its diverse and unique social, cultural, and biodiversity characteristics. The scarcity of scientific information is striking, thus, a call to local institutions and governments to invest more resources and efforts to the study of these factors in the region is key.

TI  - Commercial Consolidation Model Applied to Transport Infrastructure
T2  - XII CONGRESO DE INGENIERIA DEL TRANSPORTE

KW  - RISK
AB  - Since the 1990s, transport concessions, including public-private partnerships (PPPs), have been increasingly adopted by governments as an alternative for financing and operations in public investments, especially in transport infrastructure. The advantage pointed out by proponents of these models lies in merging the expertise and capital of the private sector to the public interest. Several arrangements are possible and have been employed in different cases. After the duration of the first PPP contracts in transportation, many authors have analyzed the success and failure factors of partnerships. The occurrence of failures in some stages of the process can greatly encumber the public administration, incurring losses to the fiscal responsibility of the competent bodies. This article aims to propose a new commercial consolidation model applied to transport infrastructure to ensure fiscal sustainability and overcome the weaknesses of current models. Initially, a systematic review of the literature covering studies on transport concessions between 1990 and 2015 is offered, where the different approaches between various countries are compared and the critical success factors indicated in the studies are identified. In the subsequent part of the paper, an approach for the commercial consolidation of the infrastructure concessions is presented, where the concessionary is paid following a finalistic performance model, which includes the overall fiscal balance of regional growth. Finally, the papers analyses the usefulness of the model in coping with the critical success factors explained before.

AB  - Social enterprises, located between non-profit organisations and for-profit firms, often struggle to acquire external funding. An increasing amount of research on the external financing of social enterprises stems from a fragmented body of the literature anchored in a variety of subject areas (e.g. entrepreneurship, public sector management, general management and strategy). We systematically review 204 academic articles published between 1998 and 2021 to bridge the knowledge gaps in these subject areas by: (1) mapping the field of the external financing of social enterprises at the individual, organisational and institutional levels; (2) synthesising the findings to develop an overarching framework; and (3) discussing theoretically sound future research avenues. We find that research at the individual level focuses primarily on investors' perspective of the ideal characteristics of a social entrepreneur. Research at the organisational level often addresses the dual logics of social enterprises and their impact on the successful financing of these businesses and the role of investor-investee collaboration. Research at the institutional level can be clustered into cultural, economic, political and legal factors. Overall, we stress the need for research that adopts an overarching view by considering all three levels of analysis simultaneously and using organisational and economic theories.

AB  - BackgroundOpportunities for social connection between generations have diminished over the last few decades around the world as a result of changes in the way that we live and work. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated loneliness for many with young and old being kept apart for safety. The Public Health England prevention concordat for better mental health (Office for Health Improvement and Disparities) aims to bring a prevention-focused approach to improving public mental health. The concordat promotes evidence-based planning and commissioning to increase the impact on reducing health inequalities using sustainable and cost-effective interventions that impact on the wider determinants of mental health and wellbeing for children and young people and older people. Intergenerational activities could provide an opportunity to support both populations. In 2023, we produced an evidence and gap map to illustrate the amount and variety of research on intergenerational interventions and the gaps in research that still exist in this area. The review conducted here is based on the evidence in that map.ObjectivesThis systematic review examines the impact of intergenerational interventions on the wellbeing and mental health of older people and identifies areas for future research as well as key messages for service commissioners.Search MethodsWe searched an evidence and gap map published in 2022 (comprehensive searches conducted July 2021 and updated June 2023) to identify randomised controlled trials of intergenerational interventions that report mental health and wellbeing outcomes for older people.Selection CriteriaRandomised controlled trials of intergenerational interventions that involved unrelated younger and older people with at least one skipped generation between them and reported mental health or wellbeing outcomes for older people were included in this review.Data Collection and AnalysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by The Campbell Collaboration. We conducted data extraction and Cochrane risk of bias assessments in EPPI reviewer. Where data allowed meta-analyses were conducted in STATA.Main ResultsThis review includes 14 trials from six different countries. The trials had some important methodological weaknesses. Interventions were mainly delivered in-person and often in groups. They included visiting programmes, school volunteering programmes, music-based interventions and task-oriented interventions such as activities set in a multigenerational park, reminiscing activities, aggression management programmes, learning a language, making local environmental changes and in-school project work. Intergenerational interventions showed a small positive trend towards improving self-esteem (effect size [ES]: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.35, 1.01) and depression (ES: 0.19, 95% CI: -0.23, 0.60) for older people participating. However, due to the small study sizes and low number of studies available, we cannot be confident about any effects. The results for other mental health and wellbeing outcomes are reported but due to little overlap in similar assessments across the studies, we could not combine them to assess the strength of evidence. There were no data about social isolation, spiritual health or sense of community. There are no long-term studies and no data on equity. We still know very little about what works and how or why. Whilst some interventions do use theories and logic to inform their development others do not. More exploration of this is needed.
   Authors' ConclusionsCommissioners and intervention developers should ensure interventions provide sufficient theoretical evidence for the logic behind the proposed intervention and should improve their consideration of equity within the interventions Research on intergenerational interventions need more consistent and agreed measures for reporting outcomes including community outcomes (core outcome sets). More understanding is needed on how best to measure 'community' outcomes. Research on intergenerational interventions should measure outcomes for BOTH the older and younger population engaged in the intervention-these may or may not be the same outcomes reflected in both populations. Further research is needed on the long-term impact of interventions on outcomes (whether participants need to keep being involved in an 'intervention' to continue to benefit) and sustainability of interventions beyond the initial funding of the research project. Supporting this our stakeholders highlighted that interventions that are initiated for research and then end (usually within a year) are not helpful.

AB  - Global to local environmental policy-making is increasingly evidenced-based. Knowledge management (KM) is increasingly used by environmental scientists and policymakers, to deliver evidence-based policy and practice. There is thus an urgent need to identify whether and how knowledge is exchanged between knowledge producers and users in environmental science fields. Here we apply an assessment framework developed in social medicine to identify what forms of environmental knowledge are exchanged, and why and how they are exchanged. We focussed on China, as international research to better manage Chinese ecosystem services is rapidly-increasing, yet, how to best integrate this into political decision-making and the public realm remains a challenge. How KM is practiced in China is unknown. We addressed this through: 1) a systematic analysis of published KM research in China compared to global trends; 2) evaluating KM for environmental policy and management in China; 3) quantitative surveys of Chinese (n = 72) and British (n = 16) scientists researching Chinese environmental problems. The systematic literature review of two databases identified two key findings. One, of 291 papers that considered KM there were no papers in the environmental sector examining the science-policy-practice interface in China. Two, only 13 of 423 potentially relevant papers explicitly examined KM for environmental topics, notably for agriculture and information exchange (the 'What?'). Most papers reported a one-way interaction between scientists and users (the 'How?'), used to change practice (the 'Why?'), Our survey showed significantly-less awareness and use of two-way knowledge exchange (KE) methods by Chinese scientists. The paucity of documented KM research and limited evidence for two-way interaction show KE at the environmental science-policy-practice interface in China is limited. Promotion of KE practice may benefit environmental policy-making in China. We have also shown that conceptual frameworks for mapping and assessing KE practice from social medicine can be usefully adapted for examining environmental science policy interfaces.

AB  - Every woman experiences the menopause transition period in a very individual way. Menopause symptoms and management are greatly influenced by socioeconomic status in addition to genetic background and medical history. Because of their very unique cultural heritage and often holistic view of health and well-being, menopause symptoms and management might differ greatly in aboriginals compared to non-aboriginals. Our aim was to investigate the extent and scope of the current literature in describing the menopause experience of aboriginal women.Our systematic literature review included nine health-related databases using the keywords menopause' and climacteric symptoms' in combination with various keywords describing aboriginal populations. Data were collected from selected articles and descriptive analysis was applied.Twenty-eight relevant articles were included in our analysis. These articles represent data from 12 countries and aboriginal groups from at least eight distinctive geographical regions. Knowledge of menopause and symptom experience vary greatly among study groups. The average age of menopause onset appears earlier in most aboriginal groups, often attributed to malnutrition and a harsher lifestyle.This literature review highlights a need for further research of the menopause transition period among aboriginal women to fully explore understanding and treatment of menopause symptoms and ultimately advance an important dialogue about women's health care.

AB  - Integrated water management (IWM) is widely regarded as a key strategy in achieving a variety of urban sustainability goals. Despite the promise of this strategy, however, uptake of IWM practices has generally been slow. A central reason for this lies in the divergence of action recommendations in the literature and actual water management praxis. In this paper, we explore how action taken by governments relate (or not) to IWM dimensions found in the literature. We do this by combining a corpus of actions taken by local governments in Arizona with a systematic review of the IWM literature. More precisely, we identify a confined set of IWM action dimensions particularly relevant to current praxis and apply these to water management practices reported by local governments in Arizona. We find that governments in the state systematically use IWM strategies to complement or enhance traditional water management approaches. Uptake differs across management spheres in terms of magnitude and form and is informed by contextual characteristics. Overall, our study indicates that transition may be guided by bottom-up experimentation, context-sensitive selection, and incremental change. This is in contrast to how IWM is often understood in the literature - as sharp shift and break with old traditions.

AB  - Diverse forms of environmental problems pose a serious threat to the natural environment. Environmental sustainability is the foremost topic in the contemporary tourism and hospitality industry. Environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior is an important aspect of environmental protection, which eventually benefits the society. In order to better understand environmentally-sustainable consumption and promote environmentally responsible consumer behavior, this research provides a sound conceptualization of environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior, and presents a systematic review and perspective on theories (theory of reasoned action, norm activation theory, theory of planned behavior, model of goal-directed behavior, and value-belief-norm theory) established in tourism and environmental psychology. In addition, this study introduces the essential drivers of environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior (green image, pro-environmental behavior in everyday life, environmental knowledge, green product attachment, descriptive social norm, anticipated pride and guilt, environmental corporate social responsibility, perceived effectiveness, connectedness to nature, and green value). Lastly, this paper provides the values of the latest studies on the special issue of environmental sustainability and consumer behavior in tourism and hospitality. This study as an introductory paper along with other articles in this special section help enable a collaboration platform across tourism and hospitality fields in pursuit of universal goals for promoting pro-environmental consumption and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Microbiomes are defined as complex microbial communities, which are mainly composed of bacteria, fungi, and viruses residing in diverse regions of the human body. The human stomach consists of a unique and heterogeneous habitat of microbial communities owing to its anatomical and functional characteristics, that allow the optimal growth of characteristic bacteria in this environment. Gastric dysbiosis, which is defined as compositional and functional alterations of the gastric microbiota, can be induced by multiple environmental factors, such as age, diet, multiple antibiotic therapies, proton pump inhibitor abuse, H. pylori status, among others. Although H. pylori colonization has been reported across the world, chronic H. pylori infection may lead to serious consequences; therefore, the infection must be treated. Multiple antibiotic therapy improvements are not always successful because of the lack of adherence to the prescribed antibiotic treatment. However, the abuse of eradication treatments can generate gastric dysbiotic states. Dysbiosis of the gastric microenvironment induces microbial resilience, due to the loss of relevant commensal bacteria and simultaneous colonization by other pathobiont bacteria, which can generate metabolic and physiological changes or even initiate and develop other gastric disorders by non-H. pylori bacteria. This systematic review opens a discussion on the effects of multiple environmental factors on gastric microbial communities.

AB  - The universalization of drinking water in rural communities poses a great challenge to developing countries, where rural areas often receive poor water service coverage and limited attention from authorities. This scenario is the current reality in Brazil. The community management model of rural water services has proven to be a noteworthy approach to ensure the continuity of water supply where private and public entities do not operate. However, its sustainability depends on several aspects. The authors of the current paper performed a thorough review of relevant publications in the rural sanitation field of study using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology, which enabled the creation of a list of essential factors capable to ensure the sustainability of Rural Water Supply Services (RWSS). Using the Nominal Group Technique with a selection of participants from a national conference held in Brazil in 2015, specialists hierarchized the factors, demonstrating their perception of the most important aspects necessary in RWSS throughout Brazil. Consequently, the authors noticed the necessity of a strong enabling environment, which recognizes small communities and their local services. Water quality control, post-construction support and the existence of a financial scheme were also pointed out as important aspects to ensure RWSS's sustainability.

AB  - Problems related to high levels of gaming and Internet usage are increasingly recognized as a potential public health burden across the developed world. The aim of this review was to present an international perspective on prevention strategies for Internet gaming disorder and related health conditions (e.g., Internet addiction), as well as hazardous gaming and Internet use. A systematic review of quantitative research evidence was conducted, followed by a search of governmental reports, policy and position statements, and health guidelines in the last decade. The regional scope included the USA, UK, Australia, China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Prevention studies have mainly involved school-based programs to train healthier Internet use habits in adolescents. The efficacy of selective prevention is promising but warrants further empirical attention. On an international scale, the formal recognition of gaming or Internet use as a disorder or as having quantifiable harms at certain levels of usage has been foundational to developing structured prevention responses. The South Korean model, in particular, is an exemplar of a coordinated response to a public health threat, with extensive government initiatives and long-term strategic plans at all three levels of prevention (i.e., universal, selective, and indicated). Western regions, by comparison, are dominated by prevention approaches led by non-profit organizations and private enterprise. The future of prevention of gaming and Internet problems ultimately relies upon all stakeholders working collaboratively in the public interest, confronting the reality of the evidence base and developing practical, ethical, and sustainable countermeasures.

AB  - Environmental change is growingly reported as an important driver of human migration. Among all environmental variables, water crises are the most critical factors. To date, patterns of interconnections between changes in water and migration are not yet clearly understood. Here, we explore these patterns through a systematic review that combined a quantitative text-mining approach with qualitative thematic analysis. Our results generally concur with those of previous studies, which found that water-driven migration usually occurs internally and that the population in low- and middle-income countries and in dry regions are the most vulnerable and more likely to migrate or be displaced in the face of water-related events. However, our causal network analysis highlights that water is not the only reason for migration: Its related problems could be major triggers driving people-at-risk to leave their original place. Based on observed evidence, water-driven migration can be generally divided into four patterns: variability in water quantity, damaging water hazards and extremes, physical disturbances to water systems, and water pollution. These patterns are not independent but interconnected through multifaceted factors affecting people's livelihoods and their decisions to migrate. Understanding water-migration dynamics requires systematic thinking of the interconnections between changes in water and in migration patterns, the investigation of interactions between fast and slow water variables and their dynamic link to other socioeconomic variables, an integrated water-migration database to help identify early-warning signals of damaging water hazards that may result in undesirable migration, and targeted water policies that focus on building the resilience of vulnerable regions and population to climate change.This article is categorized under:Human Water > Value of Water

AB  - The European Green Deal (EGD) represents the most ambitious environmental policy framework in European history, aimed at improving the health and well-being of citizens and future generations through climate action and becoming the first climate-neutral region in the world by 2050. The EC has initiated the European Democracy Action Plan and the European Climate Pact to include the participation of citizens in a meaningful way to help achieve these goals (i.e. not simply a tokenistic gesture or box-ticking exercise). While these efforts to ensure greater citizen participation and deliberation in environmental policy are good first steps, there is still a lack of clarity about what meaningful citizen engagement should look like. This paper will propose that for such efforts to be successful, we need to assess different perspectives in the debate and provide recommendations based on this. This paper provides a systematic review of various approaches within the academic literature on citizen participation and deliberation in environmental policy (ecocentrism, biocentrism, ecomodernism, ecofeminism, environmental pragmatism, environmental citizenship, environmental rights, and environmental justice). Following this, we provide a list of 16 criteria (in five thematic sections) for policymakers, civil society organisations (CSOs), and society, to ensure meaningful citizen participation and deliberation.

AB  - Policy provides a roadmap for actions to be taken in any task. It plays an important role in successful implementation of any program. Similarly, the presence of policy also plays a key role in implementation of digital preservation program. The organizations having such policy hold an edge for carrying out their digital preservation activities in an organized manner. This paper provides an explicit overview regarding preparedness of libraries and other organizations across the world in terms of availability of policies for digital preservation. The paper also attempts to map the data geographically. The empirical studies were reviewed systematically, and the extracted data was synthesized for producing meaningful insight about this phenomenon. The meta-analysis affirms that libraries and other organizations seem to have realization about importance of policies for implementation of digital preservation program. Although some studies highlight the availability of digital preservation policies in a good number of organizations yet, as a whole, most of the studies point out passive organizational attitude toward the development of such policies. The data mapping affirms that the studies conducted worldwide and North American region show a satisfactory situation in terms of availability of digital preservation policies. However, the studies conducted in European countries, African region, China, and New Zealand identify a gap regarding presence of such policies.

AB  - Cities, the main place of human settlements, are under various mega challenges such as climate change, popu-lation increase, economic growth, urbanization, and pandemic diseases, and such challenges are mostly inter -linked. Urban heat, due to heatwaves and heat islands, is the combined effect of climate change and urbanization. The COVID-19 is found to be a critical intervention of urban heat. However, the interrelationship between COVID-19 and urban heat has not been fully understood, constraining urban planning and design ac-tions for improving the resilience to the dual impacts of heat and the pandemic. To close this research gap, this paper conducted a review on the co-occurrence of urban heat and the COVID-19 pandemic for a better under-standing of their synergies, conflicts or trade-offs. The research involves a systematic review of urban temper-ature anomalies, variations in air pollutant concentrations, unbalanced energy development, and thermal health risks during the pandemic lockdown. In addition, this paper further explored data sources and analytical methods adopted to screen and identify the interventions of COVID-19 to urban heat. Overall, this paper is of significance for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on urban heat and provides a reference for coping with urban heat and the pandemic simultaneously. The world is witnessing the co-existence of heat and the pandemic, even in the post-pandemic era. This study can enlighten city managers, planners, the public, and researchers to collaborate for constructing a robust and resilient urban system for dealing with more than one challenges.

AB  - Various aspects of motherese also known as infant-directed speech (IDS) have been studied for many years. As it is a widespread phenomenon, it is suspected to play some important roles in infant development. Therefore, our purpose was to provide an update of the evidence accumulated by reviewing all of the empirical or experimental studies that have been published since 1966 on IDS driving factors and impacts. Two databases were screened and 144 relevant studies were retained. General linguistic and prosodic characteristics of IDS were found in a variety of languages, and IDS was not restricted to mothers. IDS varied with factors associated with the caregiver (e. g., cultural, psychological and physiological) and the infant (e.g., reactivity and interactive feedback). IDS promoted infants' affect, attention and language learning. Cognitive aspects of IDS have been widely studied whereas affective ones still need to be developed. However, during interactions, the following two observations were notable: (1) IDS prosody reflects emotional charges and meets infants' preferences, and (2) mother-infant contingency and synchrony are crucial for IDS production and prolongation. Thus, IDS is part of an interactive loop that may play an important role in infants' cognitive and social development.

AB  - The evolution of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is transforming practice in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. BIM provided revolutionary ways of generating, visualizing, exchanging, predicting and monitoring information. Over the last decade, delivering sustainable projects has become a high priority along with the recognition of the role the BIM plays to improve efficiency. However, BIM-enabled sustainability practices are still relatively immature and inconsistent. Previous research has identified challenges in the delivery of green-rated buildings, that include: dealing with documentation, evidencing requirements, monitoring progress, and decision making. Limited studies focused on linking workflow obstacles of green projects to potential improvements using current BIM capabilities. Through interrogating existing research via a systematic literature review, this paper takes the original approach of constructing an ?analysis map? to ?bridge the gap? and highlight current limitations and successes between BIM and sustainability practices. The findings are formulated through two parallel investigation tracks: the first is design task/BIM capability analysis, and the second is green project delivery problem/BIM enabled sustainability application. This research highlights future potential investigation areas, which are categorized into six clusters: representation; performance simulation; transaction and exchange; documentation; automation and standardization and guidance.

AB  - Cities are critical to a sustainable future for our planet; still, the construction and operation of cities rely on intensive resource and energy use and transformation, leading to the generation of waste, effluents, and pollution, representing negative externalities outside and inside the city. Within every process, transformation implies the use of energy and the increase of entropy. In an urban system, the transformation of energy and materials will trigger the creation of entropic landscapes, mainly in the informal city and in unguarded natural landscapes, even hundreds of kilometers away, which generates substantial economic, social, and environmental impacts. In this sense, cities are significant contributors to the environmental crisis. Upstream, degradation of landscapes and ecosystems is frequent. Cities' externalities and exogenous consumptions are directly linked with entropy and entropic landscapes, which are recognized as pollution (in the air, water, and land) or waste and in the degradation of natural ecosystems and communities. Through a systematic review of existing literature, this paper first outlines briefly how entropy has been applied in different disciplines and then focuses on presenting recent developments of how entropy has been defined, used, and characterized in urban studies concerning sustainability in cities and architecture, and presents a definition of the concept in relation to urban systems and key aspects to consider.

AB  - Conservation interventions require evaluation to understand what factors predict success or failure. To date, there has been little systematic investigation of the effect of social and cultural context on conservation success, although a large body of literature argues it is important. We investigated whether local cultural context, particularly local institutions and the efforts of interventions to engage with this culture significantly influence conservation outcomes. We also tested the effects of community participation, conservation education, benefit provision, and market integration. We systematically reviewed the literature on community-based conservation and identified 68 interventions suitable for inclusion. We used a protocol to extract and code information and evaluated a range of measures of outcome success (attitudinal, behavioral, ecological, and economic). We also examined the association of each predictor with each outcome measure and the structure of predictor covariance. Local institutional context influenced intervention outcomes, and interventions that engaged with local institutions were more likely to succeed. Nevertheless, there was limited support for the role of community participation, conservation education, benefit provision, and market integration on intervention success. We recommend that conservation interventions seek to understand the societies they work with and tailor their activities accordingly. Systematic reviews are a valuable approach for assessing conservation evidence, although sensitive to the continuing lack of high-quality reporting on conservation interventions.

KW  - ENERGY
AB  - Non-food biomass production is developing rapidly to fuel the bioenergy sector and substitute dwindling fossil resources, which is likely to impact land-use patterns worldwide. Recent publications attempting to factor this effect into the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy chains have come to widely variable conclusions depending on their scope, data sources or methodology. Here, we conducted a first of its kind, systematic review of scientific literature on this topic and derived quantitative trends through a meta-analysis. We showed that second-generation biofuels and bioelectricity have a larger greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement potential than first generation biofuels, and stand the best chances (with a 80 to 90% probability range) of achieving a 50% reduction compared to fossil fuels. Conversely, directly converting forest ecosystems to produce bioenergy feedstock appeared as the worst-case scenario, systematically leading to negative GHG savings. On the other hand, converting grassland appeared to be a better option and entailed a 60% chance of halving GHG emissions compared to fossil energy sources. Since most climate mitigation scenarios assume still larger savings, it is critical to gain better insight into land-use change effects to provide a more realistic estimate of the mitigation potential associated with bioenergy.

AB  - The volume of urban transportation sustainability assessments in academic literature has steadily increased over the last two decades. This paper targets these studies through the first systematic literature review to construct a synthesised and critical overview of how urban transportation sustainability is in fact assessed. The sample consists of 99 peer-reviewed articles retrieved via three scientific search engines. The results reveal a Europe-centric and single-case focus, a strong interest to introduce new indicator systems with limited references to previous work, and a lack of qualitative approaches and stakeholder diversity regarding the assessment methods. Nearly 2400 indicators are identified in the articles with significant variation in their use. Furthermore, the comprehensive accounting for sustainability is often overlooked, and the inconclusive assessment results are often noted by the authors of the sample articles themselves. Our findings signal that the research field is highly fragmented and to some extent fails to accumulate knowledge generated by past studies and to comprehensively operationalise the concept of sustainability. The identified shortcomings of the assessments and their implications for transportation policy-making and planning are highlighted, and based on our results recommendations to develop more reliable, comparable, and inclusive sustainability assessments for the urban transportation sector are made.

AB  - This study uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process to know the present status of research on urban Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) in the lower-middle-income countries of the South Asian region, specifically India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan, which produced 77 relevant publications after detailed scanning published between 2013 and 2022. It was aimed to analyze variations on BGI's mentions in different regions, identify BGI components found in the literature and their uses to promote urban sustainability, research initiatives, and priorities, and identify knowledge gaps for future research. The review reveals significant differences in research distribution among countries, with the majority of the articles focusing on green spaces compared to bluescapes and concentrating on topics like local inhabitant's perception of urban green spaces, advantages of implementing nature-based solutions, the role of green infrastructures in minimizing the urban heat island effect, air pollution, etc. Articles highlighted the lack of governance and the challenges in implementing and designing a BGI network. However, articles discussing a holistic methodology to implement BGI for promoting urban sustainability were limited. Gaps still exist in determining the appropriate strategy for the scope identification, creation, management, and governance of BGI and integrating it with existing grey infrastructure.HIGHLIGHTSBlue-green infrastructure research in lower-middle-income South Asian countries is reviewed. It brings out research gaps in this domain delineating the future research scope. The research highlights that fewer studies has been carried out on provisioning services thanregulatory and cultural services. A streamlined framework for identifying, developing, managing, and governing BGI is required.

AB  - Indicators are increasingly needed in landscape assessment. Over recent years, a wide range of methods and assessment frameworks were developed to describe and evaluate landscape. However, landscape study is supported by several disciplines with different research targets and goals. Hence, it is not clear to what extent academic research shows interest in holistic, multidisciplinary, and integrative approaches combining a broad spectrum of indicators. To assess this, the ability to compare research outcomes through the indicators they have used provides common ground, enabling a comprehensive analysis across several fields and topic areas. Which six categories of indicators are commonly considered and combined (e.g., ecological, historical-cultural, socioeconomic, land use, environmental and perceptual), along with the leading research trends and gaps of integrative assessments is of particular interest to landscape assessment research. Relevant records were selected following a PRISMA protocol, where indicators used in the literature were identified and organised according to the six category reference framework. Only papers with at least three categories were further analysed according to the spatial and temporal context, the integration of indicators, and the primary assessment goals. Finally, a random forest model is explored to predict which variables correlate the most with integrative studies. Main research trends and gaps are also presented and discussed. Results revealed that, although the number of integrative studies has increased through time, only 14 of the 239 retrieved records (5%) consider all six categories of indicators. The most combined indicators are ecological and land use, also registering the highest increasing trend. Historical-cultural and perceptual indicators were the least mentioned (6 and 7%, respectively). Records related to planning, management and policy monitoring goals are the most successful for stimulating integration. Studies target mainly heterogeneous regions (31%), followed by urban and agricultural landscapes (16% and 14%). In conclusion, the main integration gaps pertain to the socioeconomic, perceptual, and historical categories. This review offers an innovative approach to compare indicators used by different assessment frameworks, disciplines, and topic areas. The presence of indicators from different categories enabled the operationalisation of a systematic, formal, and applicable evaluation system to a large number of articles. This simplification offers one of many possible perspectives on a very complex issue, difficult to measure and evaluate.

AB  - With the increasing role of ICT in enabling and supporting smart cities, the demand for big data analytics solutions is increasing. Various artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning and statistical analysis-based solutions have been successfully applied in thematic domains like climate science, energy management, transport, air quality management and weather pattern analysis. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature on smart city big data analytics. We have searched a number of different repositories using specific keywords and followed a structured data mining methodology for selecting material for the review. We have also performed a technological and thematic analysis of the shortlisted literature, identified various data mining/machine learning techniques and presented the results. Based on this analysis we also present a classification model that studies four aspects of research in this domain. These include data models, computing models, security and privacy aspects and major market drivers in the smart cities domain. Moreover, we present a gap analysis and identify future directions for research. For the thematic analysis we identified the themes smart city governance, economy, environment, transport and energy. We present the major challenges in these themes, the major research work done in the field of data analytics to address these challenges and future research directions.

AB  - Background The risk of losing traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their use and conservation is very high. Documenting knowledge on distribution and use of medicinal plants by different ethnic groups and at spatial scale on a single platform is important from a conservation planning and management perspective. The sustainable use, continuous practice, and safeguarding of traditional knowledge are essential. Communication of such knowledge among scientists and policy makers at local and global level is equally important, as the available information at present is limited and scattered in Nepal. Methods In this paper, we aimed to address these shortcomings by cataloguing medicinal plants used by indigenous ethnic groups in Nepal through a systematic review of over 275 pertinent publications published between 1975 and July 2021. The review was complemented by field visits made in 21 districts. We determined the ethnomedicinal plants hotspots across the country and depicted them in heatmaps. Results The heatmaps show spatial hotspots and sites of poor ethnomedicinal plant use documentation, which is useful for evaluating the interaction of geographical and ethnobotanical variables. Mid-hills and mountainous areas of Nepal hold the highest number of medicinal plant species in use, which could be possibly associated with the presence of higher human population and diverse ethnic groups in these areas. Conclusion Given the increasing concern about losing medicinal plants due to changing ecological, social, and climatic conditions, the results of this paper may be important for better understanding of how medicinal plants in use are distributed across the country and often linked to specific ethnic groups.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity can lead to biotic homogenization (BH) and biotic differentiation (BD). BH is a process of increasing similarity in community composition (including taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic components), whereas BD is a process of decreasing similarity over space and time. Here, we conducted a systematic review of BH and BD in plant communities in tropical and subtropical forests to identify trends and knowledge gaps. Our bibliometric search in the Web of Science returned 1989 papers, of which 151 matched our criteria and were included in the analysis. The Neotropical region had the largest number of articles, and Brazil was the most represented country with 92 studies. Regarding the type of change, homogenization was more frequent than differentiation (noted in 69.6% of publications). The taxonomic diversity component was measured more often than functional and phylogenetic diversity components. Most studies (75.6%) assessed homogenization and differentiation based on a single observation in time; as opposed to few studies that monitored plant community over multiple years. Forest fragmentation was cited as the main determinant of homogenization and differentiation processes (57.2% of articles). Our results highlight the importance of evaluating community composition over time and more than taxonomic components (i.e., functional and phylogenetic) to advance understanding of homogenization and differentiation. Both processes were scale dependent and not mutually exclusive. As such, future research should consider differentiation as a potential transition phase to homogenization and that potential differences in both processes may depend on the spatial and temporal scale adopted. Understanding the complexity and causes of homogenization and differentiation is essential for biodiversity conservation in a world increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - The project commissioned by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) aimed to examine the degree to which UK, mainly English local planning authorities, incorporate health in their land use plans and development decisions. The project involved systematic reviews of evidence together with case studies. The range of performance in relation to health identified in the project shows that best practice in England depends not so much on the planning system per se, as on the leadership, commitment and knowledge of politicians and practitioners involved. The barriers to health integration are organisational and professional silos, ignorance, resources, and reactive planning regime. Clear lessons for research and practice are emerging: first, well attested research evidence is quite scarce, for example in relation to sustainability appraisal and health; second, planning agencies need to forge good partnerships with public health, transport, housing and economic development decision-makers, and develop proactive, healthy plans; the new planning regime and move of the public health function into local authorities in 2013 in England will give policy opportunities for the consideration of health outcomes in planning decisions, and research should in time evaluate if results have been achieved on the ground.

AB  - This research compares the Russia-Ukraine crisis with previous global crises and provides a quick assessment of the initial effects of the crisis on tourism. In addition, it is evaluated how the crisis has shaped international societies, economies and tourism. Since the crisis is very new, and due to the absence of deeper data, the authors made a systematic review. In this context, newspapers, journals, scientific publications and reports were examined. Global tourism is in a serious contraction due to the crisis. The interruption of international trade, the global food crisis and the increase in oil prices have restricted the global tourism and travel industry, especially food and beverage, accommodation and transportation. Emerging problems such as poverty, hunger, insufficient supply, inflationary pressure, closure of supply chains and loss of workforce require the UN to reconsider its sustainable development goals. The war between Russia and Ukraine has been criticized for all kinds of negative effects such as life and property security. The contribution of international non-governmental organizations to the solution of crises such as food, oil and supply chain is seen as insufficient. Previous research on tourism and crisis literature mentions the effects of past crises on tourism. This research contributes to the literature on the Russia-Ukraine crisis in two ways: First, it deals with the crisis arising from the war both in terms of previous global crises and in terms of sub-branches of tourism and secondly it analyzes how the crisis will play a role on future tourism. This study contritubes to the area because it is one of the first researchs to report the effects on global tourism by providing an eany assessment of the crisis.

AB  - The proportion of urban population is increasing globally. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution are leading to the urgent need to increase sustainable development of and through cities and their components. Encouraging and enabling sustainable lifestyles of urban inhabitants can be fostered by developing sustainable urban neighborhoods as the nuclei of cities. Numerous approaches exist that define principles for guiding sustainable development processes of urban neighborhoods. However, it remains unclear if these approaches really consider the core objectives that should be achieved and key actions that are involved to move toward sustainability. This study represents the first quantitative review that evaluates the principles for sustainable urban neighborhood development based on the available literature. We thus (i) identify promising approaches that present principles close to core criteria for sustainability and (ii) provide starting points for developing a more robust set of principles by bringing together the examined literature. Furthermore (iii), sustainability aspects that are insufficiently covered are highlighted. Based on the findings (iv) a road map is outlined to encourage further research on the elaboration of a sufficient set of principles for sustainable urban neighborhood development.

AB  - South Asia faces increasing flooding risks due to climatic and socio-economic changes. Various measures have been adopted by the governments of the countries in this region. However, these measures are not adequate to protect the vulnerable communities from ever-increasing flood losses. This study assesses the policy and planning processes and flood-related scientific research in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Based on a systematic review, a comparison of the existing flood management systems of the three countries is undertaken, and a framework for sustainable flood management in the region is suggested. Insights from the literature show that Bangladesh has been able to develop an effective governance structure to address flood hazards, while Pakistan's approach to flood management planning is found to be largely inadequate. This inadequacy is mainly attributed to missing links in policy formulation and planning processes, along with a lack of institutional coordination. The results of the literature analysis reveal poor support from scientific research focusing on flooding issues in the case of Pakistan, while Bangladesh and India seem to have benefited from research support in formulating their flood management strategies. Based on these findings, an alternative framework is suggested, emphasizing the need to enhance institutional linkages, community participation and evidence-based research.

AB  - Urban Sustainability and Smartness Understanding (USSU) can be defined by a group of sociopsychological determinants (such as awareness, perception, attitude and behavior) which shapes the relationship between human beings and the environment in which they live. A variety of influencing factors must exist in relation to USSU, however, a comprehensive examination of these, looking at personal, social, environmental, economic, technical, and governance perspectives in an urban context, appear to be less well researched. As such this paper provides an exploratory and critical evaluation of the literature by focusing on the USSU determinants; with an aim toward identifying the key factors (and sub-factors) that are in relation with these determinants. Two big databases of Scopus and Web of Science-have been searched systematically for the relevant studies. Therein it is observed how these factors affect USSU according to the characteristics of the study. Sustainability focused studies were found to be more commonplace than smartness studies. Moreover, there is currently ambiguity in evaluating the impacts of the identified factors. This paper concludes that a holistic approach is needed for clarifying the relationship and causality between sociopsychological determinants on Urban Sustainability and Smartness context. A framework with six dimensions is presented to initiate future studies to develop a consistent; coherent and comprehensive methodology to assess an individuals' USSU.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), marine areas in which human activities are restricted, are implemented worldwide to protect the marine environment. However, with a large proportion of these MPAs being no more than paper parks, it is important to be able to evaluate MPA success, determined by improvements to biophysical, socio-economic and governance conditions. In this study a systematic literature review was conducted to determine the most frequently used indicators of MPA success. These were then applied to a case study to demonstrate how success can be evaluated. The fifteen most frequently used indicators included species abundance, level of stakeholder participation and the existence of a decision making and management body. Using the indicator framework with a traffic light system, we demonstrate how an MPA can be evaluated in terms of how well it performs against the indicators using secondary data from,the literature. The framework can be used flexibly. For example, where no MPA data currently exist, the framework can be populated by qualitative data provided by local stakeholder knowledge. This system provides a cost-effective and straightforward method for managers and decision -makers to determine the level of success of any MPA and identify areas of weakness. However, given the variety of motivations for MPA establishment, this success needs to be determined in the context of the original management objectives of the MPA with greater weighting being placed on those objectives where appropriate.

AB  - Conservation challenges occur in complex social-ecological systems that require scientists and practitioners to recognize and embrace that humans are active agents within these systems. This interdependence of the social and ecological components of systems necessitates effective leadership to address and solve conservation problems successfully. Although conservation practitioners increasingly recognize leadership as critical to achieve conservation goals, clarity about the term leadership remains elusive in terms of specific strategies and behaviours. Our objective in this review of conservation leadership scholarship was to build on prior literature to conceptualize and define the behavioural leadership strategies that lead to successful conservation outcomes. Following an initial review of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed publications, we conducted a systematic review of 59 articles utilizing an inductive analysis approach and identified a set of five leadership domains that contribute to positive conservation outcomes: (1) stakeholder engagement, (2) trust, (3) vision, (4) individual champion, and (5) excellence in internal attributes. Each domain is defined by 2-4 behaviours that we consider leadership practices. To sustain meaningful progress toward global conservation of biodiversity, conservation scientists and practitioners must embrace and invest in leadership as an integral component of solving our collective conservation challenges.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in marine restoration, requiring a consideration of various approaches for optimal success. Artificial reefs (ARs) have been employed for marine restoration and fisheries management, but their effectiveness in restoring ecosystems lacks well-defined ecological criteria and empirical evidence. A systematic review of the literature on ARs articles between 1990-2020, a meta-analysis of their effectiveness based on the similarity of species composition with reference natural reefs (NRs), as well as bias risk analyses were carried out. Research on ARs primarily focused production of marine communities (n = 168). There are important information gaps regarding socioeconomic aspects; design, materials, and disposal in the selected habitats; legal, management, and planning aspects considering long-term monitoring. Regarding effectiveness, few articles (n = 13) allowed comparisons between ARs and NRs, highlighting the need to apply proper reference sites in AR implementations. Meta-analysis showed that ARs are not similar to reference NRs (p = 0.03, common effect and p = 0.05 random effect models). However, a high index of heterogeneity (88%) suggests that this relation may be influenced by factors other than the reef type. Thus, further analysis can disguise variables conditioning this AR-NR similarity as a measure of restoration for degraded marine ecosystems.

AB  - The Portuguese-speaking countries (PSC) have a population of close to 250 million and occupy an area of about 10.7 million square kilometers across four continents. Most of these countries are rich in biodiversity and at the same time have a human development Index below the global average. This network of countries has a great potential to promote sustainability in higher education, due to cultural similarity and existing formal cooperation in other sectors. This is the first study to present a systematic review of the literature on this topic produced by PSC. Of the 50 publications selected for analysis in this paper, 36 were conducted by researchers in Brazil and 16 from Portugal, with only two partnerships occurring between authors of different PSC. The main contributions to the subject are in the areas of education, research, and assessment and reporting. Sustainability in operations and institutional frameworks were less represented in the analyzed sample, and therefore these are issues that need to be better exploited by PSC. Other contributions included strategies to reduce the gap between university and society and the political-emancipatory perspective as a pedagogical basis to support sustainability education in colleges and universities. Possibilities for future research on the topic of sustainability at universities are suggested considering the PSC context. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article contributes to the discussion on the sustainability of the sharing economy by adopting the Social Capital Theory to expand explanations of the sharing economy's role and scope of relations with local communities in the context of overtourism. As mutual relationships have not been fully recognized through a theoretical perspective, the article aims to examine the sustainability of the process of the sharing economy impacting urban tourism communities in light of Robert Putnam's approach to Social Capital Theory. On the basis of a selective systematic review, the article discusses the sustainability of the sharing economy through the lens of bridging and bonding social capital. We argue that a new configuration of social capital, i.e., a sharing platform-modified social capital, arises from the unsustainable and disruptive power of the sharing economy implemented by virtual platforms, thereby contributing to an overtourism syndrome. However, from a medium- and long-term perspective, the sharing economy also impacts the bridging nature of social capital, which should lead to a more sustainable balance in its structure. This initial framework for understanding the impact of the sharing economy on sustainability of local communities provides an alternative approach to studying residents' perceptions and attitudes towards tourism in the areas affected by overtourism.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has emerged as one of the major environmental challenges globally. The consequences of inappropriate waste management are manifold and the trend would continue if immediate interventions are not taken for its reversion amid rapid urbanization and current consumption patterns of individuals. The concept of circular economy (CE) can contribute to a paradigm shift in the transformation of the traditional linear approach that does not favour reuse, recycle, recovery concept. Modern and proven waste management practices with collection systems, recycling facilities, sanitary landfills, and waste-to-energy (WtE) and nutrient recovery offer opportunities to improve urban environment through the valorization of waste and by-products in a CE. This study scrutinizes the existing literature on the assessment of circularity and helps to develop a unified circularity framework in the management of MSW in cities. Key aspects such as tools for measuring circularity, nexus and trade-offs, and conditions in promoting CE are discussed. Finally, this paper elucidates the need for circularity, including enablers and inhibitors for promoting circularity in the management of MSW with a case study in the city of Curitiba, Brazil.

AB  - The health of aquatic ecosystems is dependent on healthy and diverse fish communities. Fragmentation of habitat, including the disruption of traditional migratory routes to spawning sites through barriers such as dams, adversely impacts the capacity of an ecosystem to support diverse fish communities. Fish passage may be used as a mitigation strategy of those impacts. Fish passage for Lake Sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescens) is of particular relevance as sturgeon species have been identified as endangered in several of north American jurisdictions. However, passage design criteria for effective up- and downstream migration for sturgeon are not well established. Consequently, we conducted a comprehensive literature review and evaluated the efficiency of existing sturgeon passage to establish baseline information on what has been tested, overall effectiveness, design limitations, and knowledge gaps. Our primary objective was to determine the most effective methods to provide passage for sturgeon at man-made barriers and dams; i.e., what design parameters allow safe up- and downstream passage at the site of either a proposed or an existing barrier. A systematic review and meta-analysis focused on combining and contrasting results from different studies in order to identify patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, and to discover other interesting relationships that came to light in the context of analyzing multiple studies.

AB  - The urgency in providing basic shelter for a large, displaced and distressed population frequently means that the design of refugee camps follows a 'generic top-down framework' with basic humanitarian and techno-managerial planning strategies rising to the fore. These are usually based on a universal standardisation for the allocation of 'shelter' and its repetition in a grid-based settlement layout. Camps are planned with an anticipation of removal and disassembly in the short or medium term. This results in a military-style modular spatial hierarchy with formally defined boundaries. This paper is based on a systematic review of literature in the public domain about the Al-Zaatari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. Despite the originally imposed uniformity, the story on the ground at this camp is one of a rapid transformation initially through collective determination. The UN's strictly orthogonal grid was rapidly overlayed and reconfigured to support a preferred way of living anchored in continuity of the previous social and cultural norms of the refugee population. This paper illustrates these processes of adaptation and transformation and examines the evolving distribution of space between occupants, the expansion of opportunities for income generation, and the introduction of new housing typologies and services. Early interventions were collectively initiated. Over time, the influence of informal market forces led to those with resources gained ascendancy over those with less.

AB  - Seismic surveys are widely used in marine geophysical oil and gas exploration, employing airguns to produce sound-waves capable of penetrating the sea floor. In recent years, concerns have been raised over the biological impacts of this activity, particularly for marine mammals. While exploration occurs in the waters of at least fifty countries where marine turtles are present, the degree of threat posed by seismic surveys is almost entirely unknown. To investigate this issue, a mixed-methods approach involving a systematic review, policy comparison and stakeholder analysis was employed and recommendations for future research were identified. This study found that turtles have been largely neglected both in terms of research and their inclusion in mitigation policies. Few studies have investigated the potential for seismic surveys to cause behavioural changes or physical damage, indicating a crucial knowledge gap. Possible ramifications for turtles include exclusion from critical habitats, damage to hearing and entanglement in seismic survey equipment Despite this, the policy comparison revealed that only three countries worldwide currently include turtles in their seismic mitigation guidelines and very few of the measures they specify are based on scientific evidence or proven effectiveness. Opinions obtained from stakeholder groups further highlight the urgent need for directed, in-depth empirical research to better inform and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. As seismic surveying is becoming increasingly widespread and frequent, it is important and timely that we evaluate the extent to which marine turtles, a taxon of global conservation concern, may be affected.

AB  - Urban greenspaces harbor considerable biodiversity. Such areas include spontaneously vegetated spaces such as such as brownfields, street or railway verges and vacant lots. While these spaces may contribute to urban conservation, their informal and liminal nature poses a challenge for reviewing what we know about their value for biodiversity. The relevant literature lacks a common terminology. This paper applied a formal definition and typology of informal urban greenspace (IGS) to identify and systematically review a total of 174 peer-reviewed papers in English (152), German (14) and Japanese (8). We identified three main topics: value for conservation (94 papers), factors influencing diversity (80), and non-indigenous species (37). Additionally, we analyzed this literature for temporal trends, spatial patterns, studied IGS types, taxa, climate zones, human impact types, and key authors. Results show IGS plays an important role for biodiversity. Management practices were identified as the most common and negative impact on diversity, while vegetation, site age, distance to city center, and habitat diversity were positive-influence factors. The number and impact of non-indigenous species varied widely. The analysis of literature patterns reveals: an increase in publications over the last 15 years and a strong geographic bias in publications, as well as toward temperate and humid climate zones. Studies of gap, powerline and microsite IGS were scarce, as were studies of mammals and reptiles. Results suggest different maintenance regimes for IGS may improve its contribution to urban conservation. We therefore propose adapting management to the local context. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Purpose The contribution of the public-private partnership (PPP) model towards the achievement of the United Nation (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been widely acknowledged. However, limited studies have shed light on the connection between PPPs and the achievement of these coveted goals in Ghana. In this study, the authors aimed at analysing and synthesising the existing literature on the use of PPP to achieve sustainability in infrastructure projects in the country. Design/methodology/approach A three-step approach was used to retrieve and review 60 selected articles aided by content analysis. Findings The analysis showed that all existing relevant publications on the application of the PPP model to attain UN's SDGs in the country are organised around dominant themes, such as poverty alleviation, urban development, waste management and risk management. However, the review revealed little studies exist on pertinent issues relating to PPPs and sustainable development goals, such as climate action, critical resilience, sustainable finance and clean energy. Research limitations/implications Although the study is limited to 60 articles in Ghana, the results reveal pertinent gaps for further research studies to achieve sustainable infrastructural development in Ghana and other countries. Practical implications Holistically, the outcome of this study will serve as a guide to project managers to understand essential issues on attaining sustainability on public projects. Originality/value This article contributes to the literature and practice on the significance of PPP in mainstreaming UN's SDGs in public infrastructure projects.

AB  - Hydrogen is a potential low-carbon energy carrier to replace fossil fuels, especially in industrial and transportation applications where decarbonization is particularly challenging. Hydrogen can be generated via several feedstocks and technology combinations (pathways) that result in different life cycle greenhouse gas emissions intensities, thus policies and investments intended to deploy hydrogen as a climate solution must differentiate among pathways. To collect and analyze current estimates of the life cycle greenhouse gas intensity of hydrogen pathways, a systematic scholarly literature review was conducted capturing article published between 2018 and 2022.
   The review yielded 85 studies with 492 reported greenhouse gas intensity values. Steam reforming, fossil fuel gasification, biomass gasification, and water electrolysis were the most common pathways. Analysis of the reported intensity values shows large variability among pathways due to the choice of feedstock, energy sources used, and conversion method. However, estimates within pathways also show significant variability, in some cases driven by real-world spatiotemporal or system design differences, but also arising from life cycle assessment practitioner choices regarding methods and data sources.
   Despite significant variability, clear differences between hydrogen pathways can be observed. The lowest intensity pathways (similar to 20 gCO(2)e/MJ H-2) correspond to those using low carbon or renewable energy. Steam methane reforming, the most common pathway, shows high emissions at nearly 110 gCO(2)e/MJ H-2. Other promoted alternatives like electrolysis with carbon-intensive grid electricity can have even higher emissions, highlighting the need to assess pathways individually, considering feedstock, energy source, and conversion technology.

AB  - Objective: To present the state of the art of scientific research on Community-based Tourism (CBT).
   Methodology: Systematic Literature Review and bibliometric study on scientific production in CBT. A base of world journals and search for articles in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were used, showing aspects such as the evolution of publications in the area, the most cited articles, main journals and authors, the most used keywords, along with analysis of the main themes covered in the articles, the applied methodologies and the mapping of the case studies performed. The articles were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, Iramuteq, and Gephi software.
   Originality / relevance: The article presents the scientific discussion on CBT. Although there are already studies in this direction, they include more limited cuts and a smaller number of articles analyzed. In addition, the use of software allowed a better organization and visualization of the information.
   Main results: It appears that research on CBT started in the 1980s, but gained volume in the last decade. The most recurring themes are community participation and environmental sustainability associated with CBT. Most articles use qualitative research techniques, including several case studies, with the Asian, American, and African continents being the most studied, respectively.
   Theoretical / methodological contributions: The current stage and the scope of the international academic discussion on the topic are highlighted. The correlations between the different methodological approaches can contribute to the internationalization of local debates and guide comparative analysis of public policies on CBT between countries.

AB  - This paper aims to engage with the ongoing debates on the role of planning in future smart cities, to make a case for a reconceptualization of the technocentric notion of the smart city, and to elevate the position of city planning within the smart-city discourse. The central argument made is that the smart city could exploit the synergies between city planning and three techno-scientific domains including Big Data, Geographic Information Science and Systems, and Data Science- -which collectively constitute an emerging field known as Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (Geo-AI)- to meet four overarching policy goals: 1) to enhance the efficiency of urban services and functions; 2) to improve quality of life for all urban citizens; 3) to address the pressing societal, ecological and economic challenges that could plague urban systems on different levels; and, 4) to contribute to the production of spatial data, information and knowledge on human-urban dy-namics. In addition, the paper defines a human-centered conceptual framework illustrating how the cross-pollination between city planning and the three techno-scientific fields could enhance the planning practice and accomplish the smart-city policy goals. The methodology employed in this study entails a systematic review of the literature. In addition to discussing the latest achievements as well as the progress made on the nexus of city planning and GeoAI, the paper also highlights the barriers to the application of GeoAI in the planning, design and management of smart cities and identifies potential avenues for future research.

AB  - This study examines how research on smart water is contributing to climate-resilient municipal water systems around the globe. We identify smart water research trends over time, relationships with climate adaptation and mitigation goals, and applicability to places with developed or developing water and electrical infrastructure. To do so, we systematically review the literature, identifying research on Information Communication Technology-enabled technologies related to water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. We assess the relationship between each study and climate adaptation and mitigation objectives: managing greater variation in water quantity, leading to scarcity and increased stormwater; managing declining water quality; and low-carbon water systems. We find 96 relevant studies and identify five major categories of research addressing climate adaptation and mitigation: monitoring, modeling, system design, system feedbacks, and uptake and implementation. We find there is a recent acceleration in smart water research, with a concentration of studies focused on modeling. There is an emphasis on water efficiency using data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which is most applicable to cities with developed water grids and consistent electrical supplies. Secondarily, there is a concentration of work using distributed sensors for early detection of water quality degradation, which is being done in all municipal contexts. There is far less research on uptake and implementation of smart approaches, especially at the institutional level. In addition, there is relatively little work that explicitly relates smart water technologies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While smart water approaches are applicable everywhere, there is a need to for expanded focus on areas without developed water grids or consistent electricity for smart water to meaningfully contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 6.

AB  - Development of the pavement network systems, which is inevitable due to the rapid economic growth, has increasingly become a topic of significant concern because of the severe environmental impacts of road expansion. For achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the policies and actions towards the pavements' life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) must be carefully assessed. Consequently, the purpose of this review is to present an overview of LCA and LCCA used in pavement engineering and management. Through the quality control of PRISMA, fifty-five most relevant documents were extracted for a thorough investigation. The state of the art review reveals that a limited number of the papers considered environmental impacts of the pavements. Consequently, to assess the environmental impact cost, a conceptual framework was developed to better consider the LCA and LCCA on various aspects of the pavement projects including the sustainability aspects. Besides, a case study was given to validate the literature review towards proposing a novel framework for the incorporation of environmental impact cost.

AB  - Enzymes catalyse target reactions under mild conditions with high efficiency, as well as excellent regional-, stereo-, and enantiomeric selectivity. Photocatalysis utilises sustainable and environment-friendly light power to realise efficient chemical conversion. By combining the interdisciplinary advantages of photo-and enzymatic catalysis, the photocatalyst-enzyme hybrid systems have proceeded various light-driven biotransformation with high efficiency under environmentally benign conditions, thus, attracting unparalleled focus during the last decades. It has also been regarded as a promising pathway towards green chemistry utilising ubiquitous solar energy. This systematic review gives insight into this research field by classifying the existing photocatalystenzyme hybrid systems into three sections based on different hybridizing modes between photo-and enzymatic catalysis. Furthermore, existing challenges and proposed strategies are discussed within this context. The first system summarised is the cofactor-mediated hybrid system, in which natural/artificial cofactors act as reducing equivalents that connect photocatalysts with enzymes for light-driven enzymatic biotransformation. Second, the direct contact-based photocatalyst-enzyme hybrid systems are described, including two different kinds of electron exchange sites on the enzyme molecules. Third, some cases where photocatalysts and enzymes are integrated into a reaction cascade with specific intermediates will be discussed in the following chapter. Finally, we provide perspective concerning the future of this field.

AB  - Sustainability transitions literature is a rapidly growing and influential field of research. It argues for a radical change of systems providing human needs. Being triggered by the negative implications of the Western post-war model of development, major transition frameworks such as multilevel perspective, strategic niche management or transition management have been widely used to clarify and motivate socio-technical transformations in mainly more economically developed world. Because of their sustainability appeal, however, transition perspectives began to be applied in developing countries. This paper takes stock of and systematises the theoretical insights from this application. Using systematic review method of 115 publications released in the last decade, the paper discusses novel methodological and conceptual lessons around: experimentation and upscaling; stability, change and power; regime uniformity; contextual forces; path-dependence; transnadonal linkages; normative orientation and other aspects. Although the identified insights confirm the middle range character of the transition theory, they force some reflexivity and raise new research questions for both contexts. The paper also identifies a few policy implication for international organisations, donors, governments and civil society organisations.

AB  - Recent literature has revealed the positive effect of gardening on human health; however, empirical evidence on the effects of gardening-based programs on psychosocial well-being is scant. This meta-analysis aims to examine the scientific literature on the effect of community gardening or horticultural interventions on a variety of outcomes related to psychosocial well-being, such as social cohesion, networking, social support, and trust. From 383 bibliographic records retrieved (from 1975 to 2019), seven studies with a total of 22 effect sizes were selected on the basis of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Meta-analytic findings on 11 comparisons indicate a positive and moderate effect of horticultural or gardening interventions on psychosocial well-being. Moderation analysis shows a greater effect size in individualistic than collectivistic cultures. A greater effect size was also observed in studies involving community gardening compared to horticultural intervention. Nevertheless, an effect of publication bias and study heterogeneity has been detected. Despite the presence of a large number of qualitative studies on the effect of horticulture/gardening on psychosocial well-being, quantitative studies are lacking. There is a strong need to advance into further high-quality studies on this research topic given that gardening has promising applied implications for human health, the community, and sustainable city management.

AB  - Climate change and extreme weather events have been shown to increase incidences of gender-based violence (GBV). Numerous organizations have devoted significant time, resources, and effort to the design and implementation of interventions aimed at reducing GBV in Africa. Some interventions effectively reduce violence, but GBV persists and remains pervasive. The United Nations has called for GBV interventions that consider the impact of climate change on violence. This review aims to determine whether public health interventions intended to reduce GBV in Africa take into account the effects of climate change on the region and the population. PubMed, PsychArticles, and CINAHL databases were searched systematically in February 2023 for interventions conducted in Africa published between 2010 and 2023. There were a total of 86 articles in the final review that described 40 distinct interventions. The intervention designs included empowerment and participatory approaches (microfinance, microfinance plus, community education, and community engagement), changing social and cultural norms (community education, community engagement, and media), and school-based programs. None of the 40 interventions mentioned climate, weather, or climate change as a component of the intervention. There are several opportunities to improve existing, successful GBV interventions in order to increase their efficacy. GBV interventions could incorporate economic independence programs that do not rely on agriculture and include climate change education. These findings could facilitate the integration of two previously distinct research disciplines-climate change and GBV prevention-to inform future research and develop more effective and cost-efficient interventions.

AB  - This paper reports a semi-systematic literature review, identifying research opportunities for more sustainable, receiver-led, inbound logistics flows to large Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Methods The literature - a body of 229 works - was reviewed using online scholarly databases: the NOVELOG toolkit database; a CASP checklist; followed by re-reading of the refined set of works. A two-stage approach was deployed: first scoping, using a semi-systematic approach, then a narrative review, guided by the systematic review in terms of literature survey and selection. Findings The field was found to be emergent, with 77% of all articles published after 2011. Key concepts were identified and grouped as recurring, or with noticeable gaps - and therefore suitable for further research. The key gaps identified as worthy of note at this stage were: urban freight and procurement activity; private purchasing behaviour; HEIs and freight; barriers to sustainable procurement; engaging with Action Research in purchasing and supply chain management; little or no theory development; and the use of electric vehicles (EVs) in freight.

AB  - For millennia Indigenous communities worldwide have maintained diverse knowledge systems informed through careful observation of dynamics of environmental changes. Although Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems are recognized as critical resources for understanding and adapting to climate change, no comprehensive, evidence-based analysis has been conducted into how environmental studies engage Indigenous communities. Here we provide the first global systematic review of levels of Indigenous community participation and decision-making in all stages of the research process (initiation, design, implementation, analysis, dissemination) in climate field studies that access Indigenous knowledge. We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities.

AB  - Background Since 2010, the numbers of refugees have increased and around half are under 18 years of age. It is known that experience of organised violence, displacement and resettlement increases the risk for psychiatric disorders and psychosocial impairment. This review integrates recent research into the risk and protective factors for psychopathology with service and treatment issues. Methods We draw on and critically evaluate key systematic reviews in the selected areas, innovative robust studies and relevant government reports. Results Many refugee children show resilience and function well, even in the face of substantial adversities. The most robust findings for psychopathology are that PTSD, and posttraumatic and depressive symptoms are found at higher prevalence in those who have been exposed to war experiences. Their severity may decrease over time with resettlement, but PTSD in the most exposed may show higher continuity. More severe psychiatric disorders including psychosis may also occur. Service delivery needs to take into account socioeconomic and cultural influences but, given the high level of unmet need even in high-income countries, stepped care delivery is required. The evaluation of psychological interventions, often delivered in group settings, suggests that they can be effective for many distressed children; however, for the more impaired, a greater range of disorder-specific therapies will be required. Conclusions Child and adolescent mental health clinicians and service providers need to be aware of the specific needs of this population and systems for service delivery. There are significant knowledge gaps in understanding risk and vulnerability, service delivery and treatment effectiveness.

AB  - The nose is the most prominent structure of the face, influencing facial appearance and profile. Orthodontists have an awareness of facial structures, including nasal morphology, when diagnosing and treatment planning. Maxillofacial surgeons influence facial profile by bimaxillary surgery, improving facial aesthetics and harmony. The aim of this review was to summarize the available methods of analysing nasal morphology and profile, and to assess their complexity. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase using the following search terms: "nasal profile analysis", "nasolabial angle", and "nasal profile cephalometric" in order to select studies providing knowledge on correlations between occlusion and nasal development, differences between skeletal classes, ethnic variability, and differences between the sexes. Studies concerning genetic disorders were excluded. Finally, 17 full-text papers were analysed, which pertained to nasolabial angle, or facial profile including the nose. Data concerning methods, ethnic group, reference landmarks used, and measurements made were extracted and placed in tables. Numerous methods of nasal profile analysis can be found in the literature. These methods describe various numbers of parameters, which have influence on facial aesthetic. Nasal parameters are correlated to skeletal class and nasolabial angle, positions of upper incisors, and maxillary inclination.

AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality of the product.

AB  - Biochar-based column filtration systems (BCFS) for greywater treatment have gained attention in the last decade. However, a review of the state-of-the-art on this subject has not been conducted, leaving the analysis and limitations of the available research still unexplored. This paper reviews the current literature to give insights into the technology and identify new areas of investigation. This study used a systematic review approach to evaluate the documentation relating to the technology's worldwide status, configuration, removal mechanisms, removal efficiency, and water reuse applications. In total, 28 studies were reported in 16 countries including India and Sweden as leading ones. Three filter column configurations were identified: single biochar filter, multilayer filter, and polishing step in the treatment chain. The pollutant removal efficiency of BCFS ranged between 50 and 99%. Treated greywater is reused mainly for non-potable purposes such as toilet flushing, cloth washing, and crop irrigation. Overall, this technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water-scarce regions. However, further research is needed on social perception toward potable water reuse, new feedstocks for biochar production, the scaling-up and long-term assessment, evaluation of additional water microbial indicators, and the modification of biochar to target specific water reuse purposes.

AB  - Objective To identify and evaluate the effectiveness, clinical usefulness, sustainability, and usability of web-compatible diabetes-related tools.
   Data sources Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, world wide web.
   Study selection Studies were included if they described an electronic audiovisual tool used as a means to educate patients, care givers, or clinicians about diabetes management and assessed a psychological, behavioral, or clinical outcome.
   Data extraction Study abstraction and evaluation for clinical usefulness, sustainability, and usability were performed by two independent reviewers.
   Results Of 12616 citations and 1541 full-text articles reviewed, 57 studies met inclusion criteria. Forty studies used experimental designs (25 randomized controlled trials, one controlled clinical trial, 14 before after studies), and 17 used observational designs.
   Methodological quality and ratings for clinical usefulness and sustainability were variable, and there was a high prevalence of usability errors. Tools showed moderate but inconsistent effects on a variety of psychological and clinical outcomes including HbA1c and weight. Meta-regression of adequately reported studies (12 studies, 2731 participants) demonstrated that, although the interventions studied resulted in positive outcomes, this was not moderated by clinical usefulness nor usability.
   Limitation This review is limited by the number of accessible tools, exclusion of tools for mobile devices, study quality, and the use of non-validated scales.
   Conclusion Few tools were identified that met our criteria for effectiveness, usefulness, sustainability, and usability. Priority areas include identifying strategies to minimize website attrition and enabling patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about website choice by encouraging reporting of website quality indicators.

AB  - Despite the health improvements afforded to non-Indigenous peoples in Canada, Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the United States, the Indigenous peoples in these countries continue to endure disproportionately high rates of mortality and morbidity. Indigenous peoples' concepts and understanding of health and wellbeing are holistic; however, due to their diverse social, political, cultural, environmental and economic contexts within and across countries, wellbeing is not experienced uniformly across all Indigenous populations. We aim to identify aspects of wellbeing important to the Indigenous people in Canada, Aotearoa and the United States. We searched CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed databases for papers that included key Indigenous and wellbeing search terms from database inception to April 2020. Papers that included a focus on Indigenous adults residing in Canada, Aotearoa and the United States, and that included empirical qualitative data that described at least one aspect of wellbeing were eligible. Data were analysed using the stages of thematic development recommended by Thomas and Harden for thematic synthesis of qualitative research. Our search resulted in 2669 papers being screened for eligibility. Following full-text screening, 100 papers were deemed eligible for inclusion (Aotearoa (New Zealand) n = 16, Canada n = 43, United States n = 41). Themes varied across countries; however, identity, connection, balance and self-determination were common aspects of wellbeing. Having this broader understanding of wellbeing across these cultures can inform decisions made about public health actions and resources.

AB  - Background Causes for health inequity among rural populations globally are multifactorial, and include poorer access to healthcare professionals. This study summarizes the recent literature identifying factors that influence rural doctor retention and analyses strategies implemented to increase retention. Uniquely, this study addresses the importance of context in the planning, implementation and success of these strategies, drawing on literature from high-, middle- and low-income countries. Methods A systematic review of the English literature was conducted in two parts. The first identified factors contributing to rural doctor retention, yielding 28 studies (2015-2019). The second identified 19 studies up to 2019 that assessed the outcomes of implemented rural retention strategies. Results Universal retention factors for health professionals in a rural environment include rural background, positive rural exposure in training or in the early postgraduate years and personal and professional support. Financial incentives were less influential on retention, but results were inconsistent between studies and differed between high-, middle- and low-income nations. Successful strategies included student selection from rural backgrounds into medical school and undergraduate education programs and early postgraduate training in a rural environment. Bundled or multifaceted interventions may be more effective than single factor interventions. Conclusion Rural health workforce retention strategies need to be multifaceted and context specific, and cannot be effective without considering the practitioner's social context and the influence of their family in their decision making. Adequate rural health facilities, living conditions, work-life balance and family, community and professional support systems will maximize the success of implemented strategies and ensure sustainability and continuity of healthcare workforce in rural environments.

AB  - This letter systematically reviews and synthesizes scientific and gray literature publications (n = 420) to identify and characterize the nature of climate change vulnerability in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of the western Canadian Arctic and identify gaps in understanding. The literature documents widespread evidence of climate change, with implications for human and biophysical systems. Adaptations are being employed to manage changing conditions and are indicative of a high adaptive capacity. However, barriers to adaptation are evident and are expected to constrain adaptive capacity to future climate change. Continued climate change is predicted for the region, with differential exposure sensitivity for communities, groups and sectors: a function of social-economic-biophysical characteristics and projected future climatic conditions. Existing climate risks are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency, although the interaction between projected changes and socio-economic-demographic trends has not been assessed. The capacity for adapting to future climate change has also not been studied. The review identifies the importance of targeted vulnerability research that works closely with community members and other stakeholders to address research needs. Importantly, the fully categorized list of reviewed references accompanying this letter will be a valuable resource for those working or planning to work in the region, capturing climate change research published since 1990. At a broader level, the systematic review methodology offers a promising tool for climate/environmental change studies in general where there is a large and emerging body of research but limited understanding of research gaps and needs.

AB  - The bioeconomy aims at decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, preventing or reducing climate change, eliminating insecurity, and efficiently using resources; however, fierce controversy exists on conceivable pathways to accomplish these objectives. The transport sector alone, which encompasses all other industrial sectors, has grown with regard to its energy demand by 50% over the past 30 years. The aim of this paper is to promote a dialogue as to whether an economy based on biomass can be more sustainable than today's existing economies, considering that the economy needs to expand and be boosted, while creating a cascading and recycling system. This semi-systematic review paper discusses four research questions based on findings from the last 20 years: (i) What are the crucial issues in the ongoing debate on the development of a sustainable bioeconomy concept? (ii) Where are the major conflicting points and focuses? (iii) How does the bioeconomy follow current urbanization and land-abandonment trends? (iv) How will the crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic change these previous scenarios? As it is not easy to currently predict which pathway will be the most effective, whether it be the one taken as of now or a specific novel pathway, this article recommends following a strategy that is diverse regarding its approaches to shaping the bioeconomy and further funding of renewable energy sources, along with the involvement of urban planning. In addition, conclusions are validated through a questionnaire completed by 51 experts in the field.

AB  - The rapid growth of the wind energy industry has resulted in a significant increase in Wind Turbine Blade (WTB) waste, posing challenges for recycling due to the composite materials used in their construction. Several proposed techniques, including mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes, have been considered for wind-blade recycling, but determining the most effective approach remains a critical issue. This study presents the first comprehensive systematic review of available wind-blade recycling processes, evaluating their economic, technical, and environmental performance. Additionally, we consider the physical and mechanical properties of the recycled materials, which can aid in identifying potential markets for these materials. Among the various recycling technologies, microwave pyrolysis emerges as the most promising technique for recycling large quantities of WTB, despite some challenges and uncertainties surrounding its effectiveness and feasibility at an industrial scale. However, the optimal recycling technique for WTB will depend on multiple factors, including the blade material, the desired environmental impact, and the economic feasibility of the process. Based on this review, mechanical recycling appears to be more energy-efficient, while the fluidised bed recycling process demonstrates a lower primary energy demand, global warming potential, and power consumption. These findings provide valuable guidance for decision-makers in the wind energy industry to develop effective waste management strategies and plans for sustainable wind energy development. Addressing WTB waste and implementing efficient recycling techniques will be critical in mitigating environmental impacts and promoting sustainability in the renewable energy sector as the wind energy industry grows.

AB  - Since its adoption in September 2015, the 2030 Agenda has laid the foundations for a model of shared prosperity for a sustainable world. The current global pandemic highlights profound inequalities affecting our economies, health, and quality of life. For this reason, the aim of this study was to present the current state of scientific research related to inequality, poverty, and climate change, and to propose lines of improvement that can contribute to achieving three of the 17 SDGs (end poverty, SDG 1; reduce inequality, SDG 10; and climate action, SDG 13), proposed in the 2030 Agenda. For this purpose, we undertook a systematic literature review. The results show that the subject of poverty, inequality, and climate change has been little studied or articulated by researchers, and significant differences exist between the different areas studied. The highest number of publications (51.7%) is associated with topics related to sustainability-environment and economics. The remainder are distributed among 12 other research areas. Another relevant finding is that the effects of climate change are more pressing for more vulnerable populations, including impoverished women from rural areas and children from underdeveloped countries. This gender and social inequality has been rarely addressed in studies. Food security and energy poverty is another under-researched area. According to the results obtained in this work, we consider that the circular economy may improve these indicators, constituting a line of future research. Thus, one of the main objectives of this approach is to eliminate negative externalities, specifically the existing social inequalities within the current linear economy model.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the published literature on corporate social responsibility reporting (CSRR). Furthermore, it assesses the main limitations reported in previous CSRR studies and offers recommendations for best practice and future research. Design/methodology/approach A review protocol was developed to search nine major databases over a decade (2005-2017) using specific keywords. As a result, 221 articles were identified that deal explicitly with CSRR in both developed and developing countries, and a descriptive analysis was undertaken. Findings Findings of the review show that scholarly work on CSRR across the globe have increased exponentially. However, there still remain quite a few countries and industries that have been underrepresented in CSRR literature. Moreover, methodological- and sampling-related limitations have been noted by a number of scholars in the area. Based on these results, the review provides directions for future research. Originality/value The review provides a categorised bibliography of CSRR research on developed and developing countries from 2005 to 2017, covering a range of journals and countries. The review provides state of the art of the CSRR research and highlights the major loopholes in the current literature. This is a valuable study for academics pursuing research on CSRR as it provides a comprehensive and critical discussion on academic research in the field.

AB  - A growing number of researchers and stakeholders have started to address climate change from the bottom up: by devising scientific models, climate plans, low-carbon strategies and development policies with climate co-benefits. Little is known about the comparative characteristics of these interventions, including their relative efficacy, potentials and emissions reductions. A more systematic understanding is required to delineate the urban mitigation space and inform decision-making. Here, we utilize bibliometric methods and machine learning to meta-analyze 5635 urban case studies of climate change mitigation. We identify 867 studies that explicitly consider technological or policy instruments, and categorize these studies according to policy type, sector, abatement potential, and socio-technological composition to obtain a first heuristic of what is their pattern. Overall, we find 41 different urban solutions with an average GHG abatement potential ranging from 5.2% to 105%, most of them clustering in the building and transport sectors. More than three-fourth of the solutions are on demand side. Less than 10% of all studies were ex-post policy evaluations. Our results demonstrate that technology-oriented interventions in urban waste, transport and energy sectors have the highest marginal abatement potential, while system-wide interventions, e.g. urban form related measures have lower marginal abatement potential but wider scope. We also demonstrate that integrating measures across urban sectors realizes synergies in GHG emission reductions. Our results reveal a rich evidence of techno-policy choices that together enlarge the urban solutions space and augment actions currently considered in global assessments of climate mitigation.

AB  - Objectives. To determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in pain management in patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA).
   Methods. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO for randomized controlled trials in adults with IA that compared any antidepressants (administered via any route) to another analgesic intervention or placebo. We also searched the 2008-2009 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism abstracts and performed a hand search of reference lists of relevant articles. Primary outcomes were patient-reported pain relief >= 30% and withdrawals due to adverse events. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. A risk of bias assessment was performed using methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.
   Results. Eight trials (652 participants) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 trial in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (100 participants) were included in this review. The majority of studies were published in the late 1980s in patients with active disease receiving minimal disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy. All trials evaluated tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and 2 studies included a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor. Seven of the 9 trials had high risk of bias, 2 were unclear, and metaanalysis was not performed due to trial heterogeneity. RA trials with short-term outcome (< 1 week) found no significant benefit of amitriptyline 25 mg in combination with dextropropoxyphene (DXP) 65 mg over placebo, and inferiority of amitriptyline + DXP versus DXP 130 mg [mean difference (MD) 10.0, 95% CI 0.4 to 19.6]. There was conflicting evidence regarding medium (1-6 wks) or longer-term (> 6 wks) benefits on pain. One trial in depressed patients with RA showed no significant difference between amitriptyline and paroxetine given for 8 weeks (65% vs 56% much or very much improved; RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.5). One trial found that amitriptyline was no better than placebo in reducing pain in patients with active AS over 2 weeks (MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.2 to 0.8). From 5 trials, withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different from placebo. However, there were significantly more minor adverse events in patients receiving TCA compared with those receiving a placebo (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.4). These included somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and nausea.
   Conclusion. Based upon 9 trials of high or unclear risk of bias, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of TCA as analgesics for patients with IA. The use of these agents may be associated with adverse events that are generally mild and do not lead to cessation of treatment. High-quality trials are needed in this area.

AB  - Background and Research Aims Human activities seeking to satisfy various needs have resulted in deforestation and other forest cover change processes. The Natural Protected Areas are among the most efficient instruments to contain forest loss. The compensation from conservation is not sufficient to compete with land uses with higher economic rent, such as timber extraction and food production. This study summarizes the evidence and identifies research gaps on forest processes caused by productive activities in Mexico's Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. Methods We systematically reviewed the scientific literature investigating forest processes caused by the productive activities in the Calakmul, including the transition zone. We calculated the frequencies of codes on forest processes and productive activities in the entire sample (53), evaluated each code's significance in the qualitative synthesis and interpretation, and summarized the measurements of forest processes considering only the primary studies (46). Results Deforestation was the most commonly investigated process. Traditional agriculture initially caused deforestation, while livestock and conventional agriculture became more dominant recently with the agricultural intensification policies. Few articles investigated forest degradation experiencing a steady increase from fallow shortening and selective logging. Also, few studies identified forest recovery resulting from long fallows and core zone delimitation. No publications evaluated the forest cover impact of sustainable initiatives. Conclusion The tendency to quantify deforestation on a regional scale masks presence of other forest processes. The rural development programs in Calakmul did not include the environmental perspective, while participation in sustainable initiatives was low. The understanding of productive activities at the local level will allow differentiation of the long-term from temporary forest dynamic. Implications for Conservation To assure resilient and inclusive growth in Calakmul, the reduced-impact logging, sustainable agricultural intensification, improved fallows, and beekeeping should be supported with monetary resources that cover the transaction costs of unsustainable livestock breeding and industrial agriculture.

AB  - Smart cities have emerged as a result of smart interconnections of people, processes, data, and things, representing an excellent case study of the Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm. One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.

AB  - In the past decade, many efforts have been devoted to exploring the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Green Building (GB) projects. However, there is absence of a systematic review exploring these studies. Therefore, the paper presents a comprehensive review of publications from 2005 to 2018 on CSFs for GB projects. The results indicate there is a growing interest in the exploration of CSFs for GB projects since 2010. The main contributing contributors, institutions, countries and areas, as well as research methods in this area are summarized. The mostly identified CSFs for GB projects are "communication and cooperation between project participants", "effective project planning and control", "owner's involvement and commitment", "clear goals and objectives" and "project manager's performance". The contractors and owners were found more related to these identified CSFs. Finally, knowledge gaps are discussed and future research directions including: (1) more studies on relationships between the CSFs; (2) extending studies to cover all building types; (3) more investigation on CSFs for different project objectives; (4) more emphasis on how to implement CSFs for GB projects are proposed. The results could offer a favorable reference for researchers to obtain a thorough picture of the current research woks and facilitate further study in this area. The discussion of GB CSFs could also broaden the understanding of the best ways for implementing GB projects to practitioners thereby reducing the setbacks towards its implementation.

AB  - E-mobility sustainability assessment is becoming more comprehensive with research integrating social aspects without focusing only on technical, economic, and/or environmental perspectives. The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal's holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with "perception" of electric vehicles and assessing their social "impact" as well as an emerging area of "user experience" and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research. The current priority is identified as "climate actions". Increasingly important "sustainable cities and communities" shows potential for becoming one of the future research, policy, and community priorities.

Even if the papers highlight partly overlapping aspects of leadership, the study finds a rationale for the use of several concepts in the HE context. Contrary to the expectation raised in earlier scholarship, no holistic framework evolves from within the recent research to reveal the contribution that leadership of TL makes to leadership in HE generally.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations: Nearly 40 per cent of the analysed articles are from the United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada, which leaves large areas of the world aside. Implications: The found geographical incoherence might be remediated and the research of leadership of TL in HE generally led forward by widening the cultural and situational diversity in the field.Originality/valueThis research contributes to an enhanced understanding of the field of leadership in TL in HE in that it frames the concepts used in recent research and makes the differences, similarities and rationale between concepts visible.

AB  - Worldwide, the persistent trend of human and animal life losses, as well as damage to properties due to wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) remains a significant source of concerns for a broad range of stakeholders. To mitigate their occurrences and impact, many approaches are being adopted, with varying successes. Because of their increased versatility and increasing efficiency, Artificial Intelligence-based methods have been experiencing a significant level of adoption. The present work extensively reviews the literature on intelligent systems incorporating sensor technologies and/or machine learning methods to mitigate WVCs. Included in our review is an investigation of key factors contributing to human-wildlife conflicts, as well as a discussion of dominant state-of-the-art datasets used in the mitigation of WVCs. Our study combines a systematic review with bibliometric analysis. We find that most animal detection systems (excluding autonomous vehicles) are relying neither on state-of-the-art datasets nor on recent breakthrough machine learning approaches. We, therefore, argue that the use of the latest datasets and machine learning techniques will minimize false detection and improve model performance. In addition, the present work covers a comprehensive list of associated challenges ranging from failure to detect hotspot areas to limitations in training datasets. Future research directions identified include the design and development of algorithms for real-time animal detection systems. The latter provides a rationale for the applicability of our proposed solutions, for which we designed a continuous product development lifecycle to determine their feasibility.

AB  - Background. A systematic review of the research literature published between 1999-2003 was carried out to review how primary care trust groups and primary care organisations were monitoring the implementation of clinical governance and the effects this may have on nursing.
   Method. Studies were limited to research papers with explicit methodology applicable to primary care trusts. The selection criteria, search procedures and methods of data extraction and analysis were formed at the outset.
   Data collection. A data extraction tool developed by Cormack was adapted as a guide to include nine areas of methodological appraisal in summary forms.
   Results. Initially 87 articles were identified from the search. When papers were omitted on the exclusion criteria seven studies remained.
   Conclusion. Clinical governance is a notable example of co-ordinated policy development and the entire concept can be difficult to translate into the integrated and systematic approach to improving quality of care. Clinical governance requires changes at three levels: the individual health care professional, primary care teams need to become multidisciplinary with clear understanding, primary care organisations need to put in place systems and local arrangements to support such teams.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Clinical governance is about changing the way people work; demonstrating that leadership, teamwork and communication is as important to high quality care as risk management and clinical effectiveness. Whilst the sharing of information between practices is seen to be increasing with multi-professional study days occurring in some areas this in turn needs commitment for time and funding. The organisational and cultural environment within the trust as well as resource issues needs continuous attention if high quality governance is to become the norm.

AB  - Hydropower projects are site specific which require huge investment and have long gestation periods. These characteristics expose hydropower projects to various uncertainties and risks such as economic, environmental, social, geological, regulatory, political, technological, financial, climate, natural, and safety. These risk factors, if not managed in time, lead to schedule and cost overruns which ultimately cause delays in the availability of power that too at a higher cost and in extreme cases lead to project failures. Sustainability has also become a critical and unavoidable issue in hydropower development due to associated environmental and social impacts. Sustainable development is related to techno-economic development along with preserving the environment. Hence, to assure this equity and manage the critical risks more efficiently, there arises a strong need for comprehensive risk management in hydropower projects. This paper presents a systematic review of risk management in hydropower projects with a specific focus on sustainable development. The paper discusses various risk assessment techniques and recommends sensitivity analysis as a primary method to evaluate the significant risk factors. The construction phase of hydropower projects is identified as the most critical phase associated with uncertainties and involves considerable cost. Thus, the review highlights the need for incorporation of risk analysis in the cost estimation process and the provision for finance with sufficient margin on the ex-ante base cost to account for uncertainties, especially for developing countries. For future research, the use of fuzzy hybridized with artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is suggested for risk assessment of hydropower projects.

AB  - This study uses a systematic review of the literature using the bibliometric method. Research methods - selection, bibliographic analysis, grouping and systematic content analysis of scientific publications. Content analysis or quantitative analysis of publications is the transformation of mass textual information into quantitative indicators. The search for information for bibliometric analysis was performed in two scientometric databases Scopus and Web of Science on the keyword "integrated reporting " in the period between 1990-2020. Based on the obtained data, bibliographic maps were formed using the VOSviewer research visualization and clustering analysis tool. The analysis revealed 308 publications in the Scopus database and 393 publications in the Web of Science database. The number of publications on integrated reporting has been growing dynamically in recent years, which confirms the scientific interest among scientists. The constructed bibliometric maps made it possible to visually identify the most used keywords and authors in the researched articles, which form separate scientific schools. The results of the analysis allowed to establish the current state of scientific research on the subject, to conduct a comparative analysis of bibliometric indicators, to identify areas of interest for authors, to explore issues and identify prospects for further development of integrated reporting as a source of information on environmental activities.

AB  - Purpose This paper presents an overview of Latin American (LA) publications on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and closely related themes that appear in ISI Thompson Reuters Social Science Citation Index journals, in the period 2000-2017. The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to understand the institutional context in which this research is being produced, and to reflect on how it can be improved. The second is to map out key research strands in this literature, to discuss its achievements and limitations, and identify opportunities for future research.
   Design/methodology/approach A quantitative-qualitative systematic review was performed using a standard bibliometric approach. A total of 148 articles from 36 journals, indexed in the ISI Thompson Reuters Social Science Citation Index, were selected and analyzed. A systematic analysis was performed, based on a review protocol, which comprised following eight steps: research objectives, article search, articles selection, article identification, root themes coding, data coding, data coding validation and content analysis.
   Findings Research about CSR Latin America features a very low citation record. It is also very fragmented. Both of these characteristics reflect little conversation amongst scholars publishing on this topic in indexed venues. More generally, participation in these venues reflects the location of scholars working on this topic as peripheral actors in scholarly conversations. The study identifies many opportunities for future research that attend to key issues that are relevant for Latin America and that will stimulate a more dynamic conversation among scholars interested in the region.
   Research limitations/implications First, this study is limited to articles on CSR research on LA published in ISI journals. It does not show the whole trend of other academic and managerial publications in the region. Second, although the articles selected were retrieved based on 17 search terms derived from the theoretical framework, the complexity of CSR-related themes and its evolution could have caused some terms, and therefore publications, to be left out.
   Practical implications Results provide scholars interested in the region with updated information about the state of research on the topic and about opportunities for future research. They also provide business schools in the region with a valuable input for a comprehensive reflection on research policy.
   Social implications In the 30th anniversary of Academia (Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion), this study offers recommendations on how research on CRS in Latin America could be made more visible and relevant.
   Originality/value This is the first bibliometric analysis of scholarly publications on CSR and related issues in Latin America. It is also unique in addressing institutional factors that may be conditioning intellectual production on the topic.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to address the gap in hospitality and tourism (H&T) research concerning green creativity (GC) and seeks to identify the ways in which the interaction between spiritual incentives (SI) and material incentives (MI) affects the relationships among green intrinsic motivation (GIM), green extrinsic motivation (GEM) and GC. Design/methodology/approach In accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this paper examines studies related to GC in the H&T industry and analyses them using content analysis and critical analysis. Findings By integrating self-determination theory and the componential theory of creativity, this study enhances the understanding of the interactive moderating role played by SI and MI in the relationship between green motivation and GC. When the level of SI is high and the level of MI is low, GIM has the strongest positive impact on GC. When the levels of MI and SI are both high, GEM has the strongest positive effect on GC. Practical implications In practical terms, "high SI-low MI" is the optimal combination for achieving high GC and promoting sustainable long-term green-oriented incentives. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper represents the first investigation of the interactive moderating effects of SI and MI on the relationships among GIM, GEM and GC, thus enriching the research on the factors influencing green motivation and GC. In addition, this paper proposes a better decision-making basis for organizations facing a green-oriented incentive situation, according to which "high SI-low MI" can facilitate the achievement of high GC at a low cost.

AB  - Comparison is common in water management research: every table, map, and graph invites comparisons of different places and variables. Detailed international comparisons, however, seem infrequent in water resources research. To assess this perceived gap, this paper searched for examples of comparative research between two water sub-sectors in two countries using systematic bibliographic mapping procedures. It focused on rural and urban water conservation research in India and the United States. Search methods built upon procedures initially developed for the FAO Investment Centre and more advanced systematic review methods. The search generally confirmed that there have been few detailed comparative international studies on the subject of this review. Not surprisingly, there are a greater number of comparative studies between rural and urban water conservation within each country. The search also identified different conservation emphases in the two countries, e.g., rainwater harvesting in India compared with stormwater quality management in the United States. It identified unanticipated publications and lines of comparative water conservation (e.g. comparative physiology). Some transnational research goes beyond comparison to address the diffusion of innovations, i.e. research linkages as well as comparisons, although these studies are also few. The more prevalent pattern involves parallel literatures, which indicate substantial opportunities for future comparative and transnational research. This review also identified diffusion of international knowledge paths that are not the product of formal comparative research. The final section focuses on the prospects and priorities for future international and inter-sectoral research, e.g. paired multi-objective river basin research, linkages between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, diffusion of water conservation innovations, and synthesis of research on urban and rural rainwater harvesting in different countries.

AB  - The presence of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial ecosystems has been confirmed worldwide. Due to their widespread distribution and diversity in habitats, insects will readily interact with MPs via various pathways. Although the topic of MP-insect interactions is still in the early stages of research, it is becoming increasingly important. We used a META approach with phylogenetic control and subgroup examination to summarize the evidence from both field and laboratory experiments in quantitative form. The field evidence suggests that in-sects can take and transfer MPs along food chains via ingestion and adherence. Also, they are active in the bio-fragmentation of MPs and the generation of secondary pollutants. The exposure to MPs impaired key biological traits of insects, mainly their behavior and health, such as reducing climbing ability and increasing oxidative stress. In terms of exposure conditions, the small-sized MPs can induce more severe effects on the insects, while the insect response to MPs was not significantly reliant on exposure times or MP concentrations based on the current evidence available. We propose that insects not only play roles in the redistribution of MPs spatially and in food chains via bio-fragmentation but are also threatened by MPs. Our research deepens our understanding the environmental risks posed by MPs in insect ecosystems.

AB  - We review the use and findings of meta-analyses that link evolution to conservation. An initial search of the literature produced 606 studies that appeared to be relevant, 120 of which proved to be narrow-sense meta-analyses. Only 23 explicitly intersected evolution and conservation. Collectively these meta-analyses summarized the results of some 2,000 studies of similar to 3,000 species. Most of the meta-analyses examined questions such as links between genetic variation and fitness of individuals in small populations, genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation, and changes in traits in time and space in response to a variety of human impacts ranging from pollution to invasive species and climate change. By summarizing the results of large numbers of disparate studies, meta-analyses usually confirmed theoretical expectations, but sometimes revealed that predicted relationships or differences are much weaker than conventionally assumed. They have also been helpful in pointing out benefits and pitfalls of alternative methodologies and metrics. Other major areas of conservation concern such as impacts of over-exploitation have been synthesized in other ways, but not yet by formal meta-analyses. We conclude that most of the meta-analyses that have been done so far are aimed more strongly toward advancing our understanding of evolution than of conservation. We remain hopeful that this tool will find increasing use in new questions at the intersection of these fields, and be aimed more directly at providing diagnoses and prescriptions for action in the field of conservation management.

AB  - Globally, mangrove forests are substantially declining, and a globally synthesized database containing the drivers of deforestation and drivers' interactions is scarce. Here, we synthesized the key social-ecological drivers of global mangrove deforestation by reviewing about two hundred published scientific studies over the last four decades (from 1980 to 2021). Our focus was on both natural and anthropogenic drivers with their gradual and abrupt impacts and on their geographic coverage of effects, and how these drivers interact. We also summarized the patterns of global mangrove coverage decline between 1990 and 2020 and identified the threatened mangrove species. Our consolidated studies reported an 8600 km(2) decline in the global mangrove coverage between 1990 and 2020, with the highest decline occurring in South and Southeast Asia (3870 km(2)). We could identify 11 threatened mangrove species, two of which are critically endangered (Sonneratia griffithii and Bruguiera hainseii). Our reviewed studies pointed to aquaculture and agriculture as the predominant driver of global mangrove deforestation though their impacts varied across global regions. Gradual climate variations, i.e., sea-level rise, long-term precipitation, and temperature changes and driven coastline erosion, salinity intrusion and acidity at coasts, constitute the second major group of drivers. Our findings underline a strong interaction across natural and anthropogenic drivers, with the strongest interaction between the driver groups aquaculture and agriculture and industrialization and pollution. Our results suggest prioritizing globally coordinated empirical studies linking drivers and mangrove deforestation and global development of policies for mangrove conservation.

AB  - Purpose In the process of nowadays efficiency evaluation of any mode of transportation, sustainability results are the most important factor. In regard to railway sustainability, Train Control Information Systems (TCIS) are such advanced systems with important positive impacts. The main purpose of this study was therefore the evaluation of these impacts as well as the evaluation of Key Performance Themes (KPT) for sustainable railways.
   Methods Firstly a very detailed literature review of papers that have focused on TCIS and their improvements on railway sustainability, published in the scientific journal in the period from 2005 and 2016, was performed. The number of studies was then used as a main criteria in Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) evaluations or rankings of these systems and their impacts.
   Results The paper offers results from the first systematic review of papers which investigate the role of TCIS in terms of sustainability and, additionally, represents a refined approach to TCIS classification with a new classes descriptions. During review KPT for sustainable railways were also identified. Further, AHP evaluated the Train Management and Interlocking Systems and their subsystems as the most important TCIS, and safety and costs of equipment, installation, maintenance and operation as the most important themes.
   Conclusions The results are important for both, scholars for their future research and for other railway stakeholders and decision makers, who must select different systems and technologies for implementation in their railway systems with emphasis on increasing performance and sustainability. The study offers also the opportunities for further research in regard to railway sustainability.

AB  - Deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies, environments and societies. They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.

AB  - Rural commons face extraordinary challenges like fragility and sensitivity due to climate change. Retrofitting rural built environments affords benefits that could overcome these challenges and support sustainable development. However, notwithstanding the vast energy retrofitting interventions available, the associated aspects require investigation, particularly in distinct rural contexts with all their valuable, cultural, and historical inheritance. Hence, this study aimed to examine energy retrofitting practices in rural settlements worldwide over a decade to diagnose the goals that are being undertaken, stakeholder engagement, and finally, the bi-correlation between rural contexts and interventions, and retrofitting contributions to valorizing the place's identity. This study is a systematic literature review (SLR) considering the items of the PRISMA checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). An SLR of published peer-reviewed studies between January 2012 and March 2023 in 16 electronic databases in all available languages, using a combination of seven keywords within three domains, was conducted. The initial search resulted in 397; after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, there were 60 eligible articles. The academic progress and tendencies in the energy retrofitting domain of rural built environments are discussed and summarized into four major thematic classifications (energy efficiency strategies, energy efficiency planning, policy evaluation, and occupant behavior). Briefly, rural buildings lack energy-saving designs. Simulation tools are essential; however, they should be calibrated with on-site conditions, showing the reasons for selecting the applied retrofitting measures and correlation with the surrounding context. Successful implementation requires cross-disciplinary collaboration, engaging decision makers, and providing energy education for the local community. Regulations should include micro-context-specific environmental performance indicators. These insights could help map out future academic pursuits and help the stakeholders better understand their nature. Simultaneously, this study assists early-stage researchers in conducting systematic literature reviews utilizing different tools. However, the SLR protocol may have limited findings due to the specific search terms used, so the authors believe the more the literature search scope is broadened, the more discoveries could be made.

AB  - As the main sites of urban residents' recreational activity in a mass leisure era, urban public recreational space (UPRS) is the primary component of urban public spatial systems. To satisfy current demands for the construction of livable cities and to meet the challenges of UPRS development in an urbanizing context, a scientific and systematic review of the latest developments in UPRS research is important for developing this field. Based on 1264 papers from the China National Knowledge Internet and the Web of Science from 1985 to 2018, this study examined research developments on UPRS in China. Through a quantitative literature analysis, we divided UPRS-related research in China into three stages of development: the starting period (1985-2000), the growth period (2001-2009), and the consolidation period (2010-2018). Next, we identified nine "hot" research topics on UPRS and reviewed developments in each of these. These topics were the classification of UPRS, spatial structure and layout, comprehensive evaluation, planning and development, the impacts of UPRS development, spatial-temporal evolution laws and mechanisms, space imagery features, sustainable utilization, and governmental decision making on UPRS. We also systematically reviewed the research methods and spatial scales used in UPRS-related studies in China. In response to deficiencies in existing research, we put forward several suggestions regarding future research: Chinese UPRS studies should focus on basic theoretical research; construct a new research system that accounts for Chinese characteristics, based on interdisciplinary and multilevel spatial integration; develop a humanistic philosophy and build management systems for UPRS that can lead to the development of world-class cities based on a global vision.

AB  - Electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) has become a global crisis. Managing this ever-growing problem has become very critical and yet challenging, especially in the South Asian region; otherwise, it may undermine the sustainability of development and growth of numerous industries. Hence, to explore the current context of e-waste management, recycling, and strategies in Sri Lanka, we conducted a systematic literature review process using peer-reviewed research articles retrieved from Google Scholar Database. We searched for articles containing keywords such as "e-waste", "management strategies and recycling", and "Sri Lanka". We screened out papers (n = 20) selected from papers (n = 327) initially retrieved over a 17 period of time (2005-2022). The analysis of the screened articles showed that the main challenges to successful e-waste management were a lack of management strategies, policies, and inadequate recycling practices as well as identifying the potential and opportunities to actively enhance the comprehensive awareness, collection, storage, proper disposal, and other e-waste management steps in Sri Lanka. Further, the study identified technological, financial, socio-economic, and institutional sectors as fundamental sectors to formulate a strategic plan for e-waste management. Also, the study suggests that enacting laws to practice and adopt e-waste management, establishing central command and management institutes to control all e-waste management bodies, providing financial assistance to informal e-waste collectors and recyclers, and introducing e-waste management to school curricula are some of the possible actions that can be taken along with enhancing the awareness of e-waste management.

AB  - The fundamental change in nocturnal landscapes due to the increasing use of artificial light at night (ALAN) is recognized as being detrimental to the environment and raises important regulatory questions as to whether and how it should be regulated based on the manifold risks to the environment. Here, we present the results of an analysis of the current legal obligations on ALAN in context with a systematic review of adverse effects. The legal analysis includes the relevant aspects of European and German environmental law, specifically nature conservation and immission control. The review represents the results of 303 studies indicating significant disturbances of organisms and landscapes. We discuss the conditions for prohibitions by environmental laws and whether protection gaps persist and, hence, whether specific legislation for light pollution is necessary. While protection is predominantly provided for species with special protection status that reveal avoidance behavior of artificially lit landscapes and associated habitat loss, adverse effects on species and landscapes without special protection status are often unaddressed by existing regulations. Legislative shortcomings are caused by difficulties in proving adverse effect on the population level, detecting lighting malpractice, and applying the law to ALAN-related situations. Measures to reduce ALAN-induced environmental impacts are highlighted. We discuss whether an obligation to implement such measures is favorable for environmental protection and how regulations can be implemented.

AB  - In tropical waters where temperatures are relatively stable, we investigated whether the relationship between phytoplankton growth and grazing loss rate across different habitats around Peninsular Malaysia can be attributed to its eutrophication states. We measured phytoplankton growth (mu) and grazing loss (g) rates in waters off Bachok Marine Research Station (BMRS), located northeast of Peninsular Malaysia. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration ranged from 2.90 to 15.78 mu g/L and was dominated by nano-and micro-phytoplankton (>2 mu m in size). Using the Landry and Hassett dilution method, mu at BMRS ranged from 1.02 to 1.58 per day whereas g varied from 0.07 to 0.88 per day. Grazing accounted for 35% of the primary production at BMRS. A systematic review of available data in waters around Peninsular Malaysia, revealed how mu fluctuated over a wide range (0.01-1.80 per day) and correlated with chl a distribution (R-2=0.181- P<0.001). However, the relationship was only significant at a for mesotrophic waters and a for eutrophic waters. In contrast, g ranged from 0.00 to 1.01 per day, and correlated with mu at all locations. The g/mu slope ranged from 19% to 84%, and was generally similar for waters around Peninsular Malaysia. However, all the g/mu slopes had a positive y-intercept except for BMRS, and this seemed to suggest the availability of alternative prey supporting grazing at the other stations.

AB  - Since the diverse interests of multiple stakeholders inevitably increase the complexity of urban regeneration projects, collaborative decision-making has gradually been regarded as a solution to such a challenging problem. Although existing studies have begun to pay attention to the issue of collaborative decision-making between various stakeholders in urban regeneration, some problems e.g., inappropriate collaborative strategies, unreasonable distribution mechanism for stakeholders' interests, have yet to be solved and the research is still in the early stage. To better guide the investigation in this area, a comprehensive and systematic review for the existing studies is necessary. Using bibliometric approach, this paper classifies 160 journal papers related to decisionmaking in urban regeneration into three categories: (1) policies and strategies, (2) stakeholders, and (3) approaches and tools. Followed by a critical review to identify limitations of current research and future research directions. Finally, constructive suggestions and implications for collaborative decision-making in urban regeneration are provided, in terms of policy formulation, stakeholder coordination, and development of decision support tools. This review paper can be used as a roadmap for global researchers who focus on collaborative decision-making in urban regeneration, which could assist in the formulation of appropriate policies and the development of reliable decision-making toolkits.

AB  - Background and AimsOverweight and obesity lead to the development of physical diseases. Cognitive factors play a vital role in controlling one's weight. Currently, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions are recognized as a subcategory of lifestyle modification programs that can be implemented to control weight and modify eating patterns as well as physical activity. Nowadays, smartphone-based applications are utilized to implement behavioral interventions. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of CBT-based smartphone applications available on Google Play and the App Store in the field of overweight control. MethodsSmartphone-based utility applications available on Google Play and App Store were identified in March 2021. Weight control smartphone applications were obtained based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The app name, platform, version, number of downloads, password protection, affiliations, and features of retrieved apps were tabulated. The Mobile Application Rating Scale was utilized to evaluate the quality of the identified apps. ResultsSeventeen CBT-based weight control smartphone apps were retrieved. The average engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality scores were 3.65, 3.92, 3.80, and 3.91, respectively. Also, the average score in an aspect containing the usefulness of the app, frequency of using the application, cost, and user satisfaction was 3.5. ConclusionFuture applications related to this field can be improved by providing a personalization program according to the needs of users and the possibility of online chatting with the therapist. Further improvements can be achieved by improving the areas of engagement, aesthetics, and subjective quality as well as having appropriate privacy policies.

AB  - Sustained policy support is necessary in order to drive a transition toward renewable energy (RE). The ability to realize RE policy objectives is constrained by a range of geographic factors related to resource potential, the distribution of resources, land availability/suitability, the absorptive capacity of proximal infrastructure, and local socio-political acceptance. With this in mind, this paper provides a systematic review of how geographic information science and remote sensing techniques have been applied to reduce uncertainties surrounding renewable energy development, with emphasis on policy and planning needs. The concept of a 'geo-information infrastructure' is used to bring coherence and direction to this growing body of literature. The review highlights four underdeveloped research areas, including: Resolving issues of scalar discordance through comprehensive analysis at local and regional scales; mapping interactions in space of multiple supply options to deliver more accurate and sophisticated estimates of RE potential in an area and to identify competitive and symbiotic land-use situations; using energy resource maps as primary inputs into the development of technology roadmaps; and developing geographically explicit indicators which can signal priority areas for RE recovery based on social and. environmental returns on investments. In each case, suggestions moving forward are provided. The paper identifies knowledge-based institutional networking as a pathway through which local and regional public authorities can be equipped with the resources necessary to build and mobilize a geo-information infrastructure.

AB  - The oyster shell is a residue rich in calcium carbonate, which can be reused as a raw material for creating building materials. For this reason, many researchers focused on the incorporation of oyster shell in the composition of composites, as it is a means of contributing to the economic sustainability by reducing the presence of pollution caused by aquaculture waste in the environment, thus increasing the value chain of the construction sector and reducing its carbon footprint. This paper intends to systematize the scientific production related to oyster shell-based composites in construction, carrying out a search using the Scopus tool and a systematic review based on the PRISMA statement. The results show that research on the incorporation of oyster shell into cementitious mortar mixtures, with a focus on its use in concrete, dominates existing scientific research. There is a lack of studies on the incorporation of the oyster shell that address its application as an aggregate or binder in the composition of coating and laying mortars. Most existing research is from Asia, and there is a lack of research in some parts of Europe. In the Americas, Africa and Oceania, no existing studies were found. Despite the growing understanding of the importance of sustainability and economic issues related to products used in the blue circular economy sector, there are still few studies that consider the incorporation of waste or by-products of aquaculture. Future investigations that cover these practical and contextual gaps can contribute to the better use of oyster shell waste and its insertion in the blue circular economy.

AB  - Background In spite of the necessity of implementing spiritual care practices for cancer patients, there is no clear process in this regard in palliative care programs of the health system of countries. The present study was designed with the aim of developing a clinical practice guideline of spiritual care in cancer patients for oncology nurses in the current context. Methods This is a multi-method study which was conducted in five stages within the framework of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline. A research committee consisting of four focal and 16 secondary members was formed. The stages included determining the scope of the study, developing guideline (a qualitative study and a systematic review, triangulation of the data, and producing a preliminary draft), consultation stage (validation of the guideline in three rounds of the Delphi study), as well as revision and publication stages. Results The clinical guideline of spiritual care with 84 evidence-based recommendations was developed in three main areas, including the human resources, care settings, and the process of spiritual care. Conclusions We are hoping by applying this clinical guideline in oncology settings to move towards an integrated spiritual care plan for cancer patients in the context of our health system. Healthcare organizations should support to form spiritual care teams under supervision of the oncology nurses with qualified healthcare providers and a trained clergy. Through holistic care, they can constantly examine the spiritual needs of cancer patients alongside their other needs by focusing on the phases of the nursing process.

AB  - With the world's rapidly growing urbanization, urban sustainability is now expected for urban life. Due to this rapid growth, meeting the emerging challenges for urban management and sustainability worldwide is challenging. Big data-driven technologies can be an excellent solution to address these upcoming challenges. Therefore, this study explores the potential of big data technologies for ensuring sustainability in urban management. The study conducted a systematic literature review guided by PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis) on publications over the last 21 years. The study argues that urban management is an integrated function of public and private agencies to address the significant challenges of urban life and to develop the city as more competitive, habitable, and sustainable. Urban management can utilize big data analytics (BDA) for digital instrumentation, data-informed policy decisions, governance, real-time management, and evidence-based decisions. Urban sustainability can ensure the smooth operation of urban affairs through strategic planning under three major dimensions: social, economic, and environmental. Big data technologies can ensure smart transport, traffic, waste management, energy, environment, infrastructure, safety, healthcare, planning, and citizen participation in regular urban affairs to provide a better urban life. This study develops several indicators that will be helpful for concerned stakeholders in policy, planning, designing, and implementing sustainable urban development.

AB  - Objective: There is an increasing demand for the assessment of executive function (EF) among Chinese preschoolers. However, there exists methodological and cross-cultural challenges of performance-based EF assessment. The current review aims to 1) identify and summarize the current application of performance-based EF assessment tools for Chinese preschoolers in China and 2) offer recommendation guidelines for different application scenarios, such as clinical or scientific research, and for related personnel.Method: A literature search was conducted from Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. We focused exclusively on performance-based tools assessing EF among children aged three to six years, encompassing tasks of inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, reasoning, problem solving, and/or planning. Clinical (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders) and multilingual populations residing outside of China (e.g. Chinese Americans) were excluded. Two authors independently screened, extracted, and evaluated each tool for characteristics (e.g. name, domain, type, version, language, approach of administration, and scoring) and sample information (e.g. sample size, age, and region). Results: A total of 98 articles were included, with 255 tools being identified that were further classified into 44 unique types, covering nine EF domains. Most tools were original or informally sinicized, with notable variations in tool selection, administration, and interpretation process. Given that a complete set of EF tools has not been identified as perfectly suitable for Chinese preschoolers, we also offered recommendations based on empirically adapted evaluation criteria. Conclusions: Our findings highlighted the need for appropriate adaptation, administration, and interpretation of the current EF tools.

AB  - The impact of bitumen components on soil and groundwater resources is of environmental importance. Contaminants' influx into the environment from bitumen components through anthropogenic activities such as exploration, mining, transportation, and usage of bitumen in all its forms have been reported globally. However, gaps exist in the geogenic occurrence of bitumen in the shallow subsurface such as in southwest Nigeria, contaminating the soil and groundwater resources. This review presents in situ bitumen seeps as a source of geogenic soil and groundwater contaminants in southwestern Nigeria. We conducted a systematic review of literatures based on defined selection criteria. We derived information on the state of knowledge about bitumen seep occurrences and distribution in southwestern Nigeria. Also, the processes that exacerbate bitumen contaminants' influx into soil and groundwater were enunciated. At the same time, case examples highlighted areas for possible in situ bitumen contamination studies in Nigeria. The results of this review showed that a multidisciplinary approach has been employed to assess and monitor the contaminants resulting from the various activities involving the exploitation and application of bitumen in Nigeria. These studies emphasize bitumen contaminants as emanating from anthropogenic sources. The results also suggested that bitumen studies have been mainly exploratory to improve the understanding of the economic potential of the hydrocarbon reserve. Also, recent advances in bitumen contaminants studies accounted for the heterogeneous nature of the bitumen. This allows for the optimized categorization of the mechanism and processes undergone by the different bitumen components when released as environmental contaminants. However, a knowledge gap exists in characterizing and understanding the effects of in situ bitumen seeps as a geogenic source of soil and groundwater contamination. This review identifies the possibility of geogenic soil and groundwater contamination by in situ bitumen seeps in the coastal plain sand of the Dahomey basin in southwestern Nigeria. The impact of the bitumen contaminants on the environment was discussed, while methods for accessing the occurrence and distribution of the bitumen contaminants were highlighted.

AB  - In spite of the investment and efforts made for irrigation development, many irrigation schemes in Ethiopia are performing below design expectations leaving huge areas and many beneficiaries out of irrigation. In this study, a systematic literature review was conducted on management practices, problems and future directions of com-munity managed small-scale irrigation schemes in Ethiopia. Out of 1282 published research reports retrieved from the data bases of Web of Science and Scopus, eventually 83 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Failure and under-performance of irrigation schemes in Ethiopia is reported to mostly relate to problems during design and implementation and/or operation and maintenance. Low level of community participation, lack of site specific reliable hydrological data, poorly designed irrigation infrastructures, high construction cost and delayed project completion are most mentioned problems during the design and implementation phases of irrigation projects. Presence of weak local scheme managing institutions and users' exclusion in management decisions are among the main problems of small-scale irrigation management practices in Ethiopia. Regardless of their water sources, irrigation schemes face similar problems in Ethiopia. Adoption of a holistic development and management strategy that integrates technical, socio-economic and environmental aspects is needed to overcome problems and sustainability challenges of community managed irrigation schemes in Ethiopia. Supporting the irrigation sector via research-based findings and adoption of advanced technologies needs further investments and efforts to narrow challenges of irrigation schemes sustainability gaps.

AB  - Due to the world's rapid population expansion, the demand for food is anticipated to in-crease significantly during the coming decade. Traditional farming practices cannot meet the need for the food crop. Conventional farming methods use resources like land, water, herbicides, and fertilisers rather inefficiently. When it comes to making the most effective and sustainable use of resources to increase production, automation in agriculture is gar-nering a lot of interest. How people and machines operate on farms has been changed by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with numerous sensors, controllers, and commu-nication protocols. A comprehensive literature review of the key technologies involved in smart and sustainable agriculture, viz. various sensors, controllers, communication stan-dards, IoT based intelligent machinery, were compared and presented. These sensors were continuously producing a significant quantity of data on the agricultural field. These data were transmitted to the central control unit for analysis to meet the demands for water, fertiliser, pesticides, etc. The architecture and importance of data analytics in agriculture IoT, case studies of current agricultural automation utilising IoT, key challenges and open issues in agriculture IoT technology were discussed. The findings provide support for the selection of IoT technologies for specific applications.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The ski industry is often perceived as having a negative impact on sensitive alpine and subalpine communities. However, empirical evidence of such impacts is lacking. We reviewed the available literature from the last 35 years to quantify the reported effects of winter recreation on faunal communities. Overall, using one-sample binomial tests ('sign tests') we found that the effects of all types of winter recreation-related disturbances (i.e. ski runs, resort infrastructure and winter tourism) were more likely to be negative or have no effect, than be positive for wildlife. More specifically, in Europe, where the majority of the available research was conducted, the impacts of winter recreation were most often negative for fauna. In terms of specific taxa, birds and to a lesser extent mammals and arthropods, responded negatively to disturbance. Results from our meta-analysis confirmed the results from our binomial tests. Richness, abundance and diversity of fauna were lower in areas affected by winter recreation when compared with undisturbed areas. For most regions and taxa, however, empirical evidence remains too limited to identify clear impacts of winter recreation. We therefore conclude that the majority of ski resorts are operating in the absence of knowledge needed to inform effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecologically-sound management. Thus, there is an urgent need for more empirical research to be conducted throughout this increasingly threatened ecological community, especially given the indication from the available literature that fauna often respond negatively to winter recreation.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the knowledge base for amphibian chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (8d) infection in the continent of Asia. Despite an indication of geographic bias in terms of studying chytrid fungus distribution in Asia, 167 amphibian species (145 spp. native to Asia) from 16 countries have been reported as infected with Bd. Our meta-analysis shows that overall prevalence is 8.19 % (out of 28,433 samples), and Bd-positive rate in amphibia significantly varies among sampling sources (chi(2) = 380.57, DF= 6, P< 0.001) and age categories (chi(2) = 22.09, DF= 2, P< 0.001). We used Kernel Density analysis to produce a hotspot map for chytrid infection, and Digital Elevation Model to understand the distribution of chytrid positive locations across different elevations. In our meta-analysis, most of the Bd-positive sites range between 4.45-27.49 degrees C, 167-4,353 mm rainfall, 10-40 degrees N, and at lower elevations (<500 m). Using land cover analysis, we did not find a statistically significant difference among six different land cover categories in relation to the prevalence of Bd across Asia. Although no mass die-off events have been reported so far, Maximum Entropy modelling shows that Bd distribution and infection may potentially occur across a vast region of south-east Asia. In conclusion, we call for more systematic research and monitoring strategies in place for countries with little to no information, but have a moderately higher risk of chytrid distribution and infection.

AB  - Understanding the effects of urbanization on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates is an important topic of biodiversity research and has direct conservation relevance. The absence of evidence-based systematic overviews on this topic motivated us to perform meta-analyses and to synthetize the present state of knowledge. We observed significant heterogeneity among individual case studies, reporting negative, neutral and positive effects. As expected, urbanization had an overall negative effect on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates. These results are based mainly on the study of lotic (stream and river) ecosystems because there are insufficient data available for lentic (pond and lake) ecosystems. Compared to individual case studies, the present review reports an evidence-based synthesis for the first time. We identified knowledge gaps regarding case studies reporting the effects of urbanization on pond and lake ecosystems, case studies examining the phylogenetic and functional facets of biodiversity, as well case studies investigating the effect of urbanization on the beta diversity component of macroinvertebrate communities. The identification of these knowledge gaps allowed us to make recommendations for future research: (1) report results on specific taxonomic groups and not only the entire macroinvertebrate community, (2) study the impacts of urbanization on macroinvertebrate diversity in different habitat types and understudied continents, (3) focus on the functional and phylogenetic facets of diversity and (4) examine community differentiation (e.g. beta diversity) in urban freshwater ecosystems. Our results also suggested that the analysis of diversity-environment relationships is crucial for developing macroinvertebrate indicators especially in the increasingly urbanized world.

AB  - Following the industrial revolution, major economic and populational growth took place, and, therefore, solid waste generation increased exponentially. Nowadays, waste management still generates major impacts because the current wide offer of waste management strategies includes many solutions that produce suboptimal results, such as landfill or waste incineration. From a circular economy perspective, composting is a potentially sustainable option to treat the organic fraction of solid waste and has the advantage of recycling many organic compounds that can be reintroduced into the natural processes. This study aimed to provide a meta-analysis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the impacts of composting by performing a systematic literature review of the diversity of approaches and assessing environmental impacts. The results of the impact assessment were highly dependent on the choices made over the system boundary and the functional units. The most cited environmental impacts were Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Photochemical Oxidation Potential, and Ozone Layer Depletion, as gaseous emissions from the transport and decomposition represent the main contributors to these categories. Using a smaller dataset and evaluating the use of the CML method and the most cited impacts categories, it was found that In-vessel Composting and Home Composting were considered the best environmental options among the studied composting methods. Composting environmental impacts were also highly related to the use of non-renewable energy sources, which puts composting at a disadvantage when compared with the use of anaerobic digestion. Such results emphasize the benefits of using these waste management technologies as complementary instead of substitutes.

AB  - The debate over production and protection oriented forest management is long-standing in various part of the world. Taking a case of scientific forest management (SciFM) of Nepal, we aimed to analyze how policy actors, their interests and interactions (networks) shape the discursive shift of forest management practices. We employed the discourse network analysis to diagnose the policy rupture of SciFM, by using various qualitative data collection methods, including experts' consultation (n = 6), key informants' interviews (n = 36 from 9 stakeholders' group), systematic review of Nepal-based literature (n = 30), review of national policy and study reports (n = 12), and experiential observation. We carried out the stakeholder mapping, including their pattern of interactions and inter-dependencies; and analyzed the power and influence over SciFM. Based on the navigation and analysis of the actors' network, pattern of interaction, and coalition for and against SciFM, we have intensively explained how SciFM, which was developed on the background of techno-bureaucrats' dominance for the last 25 years in Nepal, has been demolished within a year because of persistent ideation of the Federation of Community Forest Users, Nepal (FECOFUN), strong and (in) formal networking of politicians, FECOFUN, and high level bureaucrats and investigation committee. The inference that we draw from our study will have policy implications to other countries that have similar socio-political context. Based on our analysis of the discourse network, we suggest navigating the concerns and gaining (in) formal confidence of (possible) policy entrepreneur, including but not limited to political leadership irrespective of the scale and size of their interest (or need) for sustaining policy decision.

AB  - Globally, the area of sugarcane is rising rapidly in response to growing demands for bioethanol and increased sugar demand for human consumption. Despite considerable diversity in production systems and contexts, sugarcane is a particularly "high impact" crop with significant positive and negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. Our analysis is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is a critical region for continued expansion, due to its high production potential, low cost of production and proximity, and access, to European markets. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific evidence, combined with information from key informants, stakeholders and a research-industry workshop, we critically assess the impacts of sugarcane development on water, soil and air quality, employment, food security and human health. Our analysis shows that sugarcane production is, in general, neither explicitly good nor bad, sustainable nor unsustainable. The impacts of expansion of sugarcane production on the environment and society depend on the global political economy of sugar, local context, quality of scheme, nature of the production system and farm management. Despite threats from climate change and forthcoming changes in the trade relationship with the European Union, agricultural development policies are driving national and international interest and investment in sugarcane in SSA, with expansion likely to play an important role in sustainable development in the region. Our findings will help guide researchers and policy makers with new insights in understanding the situated environmental and social impacts associated with alternative sugar economy models, production technologies and qualities of management.

AB  - Implementing net zero carbon supply chain (NZCSC) practises has become critical for organisations across the globe to achieve carbon neutrality in the wake of increasing climate change and global warming. Hence it is important to identify the challenges in the implementation of resilient NZCSC to support the stakeholders. The key thirteen challenges in the implementation of resilient NZCSC were identified from an extensive literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. and industrial experts' opinions. The challenges were investigated and ranked based on interrelations using pro-cedures like Influential Network Relationship Mapping i.e., Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Level Partitioning by Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) is utilised to understand the cause-effect relationship among the challenges and to further identify the key influential challenges. The alpha value after DEMATEL was found to be 0.11 and identified the lack of management willingness as the main barrier. Level partitioning showed that lack of carbon accounting is the most critical barrier, based on which a roadmap is developed to support the stakeholders. The results from the study can help managers of organisations to implement techniques to achieve an NZCSC. Combining DEMATEL and TISM is the main novelty of the study along with the roadmap. The key findings from the study provide important insights into achieving an NZCSC from both a strategic and policy-making point of view.

AB  - Community-based conservation (CBC) promotes the idea that conservation success requires engaging with, and providing benefits for, local communities. However, CBC projects are neither consistently successful nor free of controversy. Innovative recent studies evaluating the factors associated with success and failure typically examine only a single resource domain, have limited geographic scope, consider only one outcome, or ignore the nested nature of socio-ecological systems. To remedy these issues, we use a global comparative database of CBC projects identified by systematic review to evaluate success in four outcome domains (attitudes, behaviors, ecological, economic) and explore synergies and trade-offs among these outcomes. We test hypotheses about how features of the national context, project design, and local community characteristics affect these measures of success. Using bivariate analyses and multivariate proportional odds logistic regressions within a multilevel analysis and model-fitting framework, we show that project design, particularly capacity-building in local communities, is associated with success across all outcomes. In addition, some characteristics of the local community in which projects are conducted, such as tenure regimes and supportive cultural beliefs and institutions, are important for project success. Surprisingly, there is little evidence that national context systematically influences project outcomes. We also find evidence of synergies between pairs of outcomes, particularly between ecological and economic success. We suggest that well-designed and implemented projects can overcome many of the obstacles imposed by local and national conditions to succeed in multiple domains.

AB  - This paper reviews trends in the academic literature on cumulative effects assessment (CEA) of disturbance on forest ecosystems to advance research in the broader context of impact assessments. Disturbance is any distinct spatiotemporal event that disrupts the structure and composition of an ecosystem affecting resource availability. We developed a Python package to automate search term selection, write search strategies, reduce bias and improve the efficient and effective selection of articles from academic databases and grey literature. We identified 148 peer-reviewed literature published between 1986 and 2022 and conducted an inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the results. Our findings revealed that CEA studies are concentrated in the global north, with most publications from authors affiliated with government agencies in the USA and Canada. Methodological and analytical approaches are less interdisciplinary but mainly quantitative and expert-driven, involving modeling the impacts of disturbances on biophysical valued components. Furthermore, the assessment of socioeconomic valued components, including the effects of disturbance on Indigenous wellbeing connected to forests, has received less attention. Even though there is a high preference for regional assessment, challenges with data access, quality, and analysis, especially baseline data over long periods, are hampering effective CEA. Few articles examined CEA - policy/management nexus. Of the few studies, challenges such as the inadequate implementation of CEA mitigation strategies due to policy drawbacks and resource constraints, the high cost of monitoring multiple indicators, and poor connections between scenarios/modeling and management actions were paramount. Future CEA research is needed to broaden our understanding of how multiple disturbance affects forests in the global south and coupled social and ecological systems and their implications for sustainable forest management.

AB  - Food supply chains are essential for urban sustainability. To reflect on the state of knowledge on urban food flows in urban metabolism research, and the actual and potential role of urban metabolism studies to tackle food sustainability in cities, we systematically review scientific research on food from an urban metabolism perspective and apply statistical and thematic analyses. The analysis of 89 studies provides insights as to the relation between food supply and (environmental and social dimensions of) urban sustainability. First, food is an important contributor to urban environmental impacts, if a consumption-based approach is adopted. Secondly, the social impacts of urban food supply remain scarcely studied in urban metabolism research, but emerging results on public health, malnutrition, and food waste appear promising. In parallel, we find that the findings of the studies fail to engage with debates present in the broader literature, such as that of food justice. Our analysis shows that most studies focus on large cities in high-income, data-rich countries. This limits our understanding of global urban food supply. Existing studies use innovative mixed-methods to produce robust accounts of urban food flows in data-scarce contexts; expanding these accounts is necessary to get a better understanding of how urban food supply and its diverse impacts in terms of environmental and social sustainability may vary across cities, a necessary step for the urban metabolism literature to contribute to current debates around food sustainability and justice.

AB  - Walkability indicators are a pivotal method to evaluate the role of the built environment in people's decisions regarding active mobility, contributing to help promote more sustainable and equitable regions. Currently, there is a lack of literature describing the trends and findings from recent studies, and how research on this topic has responded to COVID-19. In this work, we apply the PRISMA methodology to perform a systematic literature review of studies that employed walkability indicators to uncover associations between walkability and different topics, such as physical activity, health and mobility, in the aftermath of the pandemic. Results show that the growth rate of studies in this period almost doubled compared to the three years prior to the outbreak. We explore the main subjects addressed in recent literature and found that most studies resorted to well-known indicators, predominantly to Walk Score(R), while fewer works developed and applied new indicators. General findings point to a positive association between walkability and physical activity, overall health and active mobility. Moreover, in recent works, walkability's relationship with environmental metrics is not clear and there is a lack of studies linking walkability indicators to COVID-19. More than two years after the worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, our work provides an effective resource for researchers to understand recent trends in studies employing walkability indicators.

AB  - The modern layout and configuration of cities create power generation and storage possibilities through the urban water system. Surplus energy in water and wastewater networks has come to the researchers' attention for exploitation as micro hydropower (MHP). Also, the gravitational potential energy of stored water on highrises makes them a sustainable option for distributed energy storage as micro pumped-storage (MPS). Many studies have investigated technical aspects and estimated capacity of urban micro hydro systems (UMHS) in urban in-frastructures. However, there is no systematic review of relevant literature to signify challenges and opportu-nities of different urban infrastructures as UMHS, from economic, technical, and environmental viewpoints. Therefore, this article applied a reference-by-reference method to provide a systematic assessment and concept review of UMHS, including the characteristics, challenges, and drivers of potential sites for MHP and MPS development. Examining the challenges of real case studies worldwide identifies economic feasibility and energy generation reliability as obstacles in developing MPS and MHP, respectively. Nevertheless, overlooked oppor-tunities are recognised that may accelerate UMHS proliferation. UMHS synergies, such as water saving and peak -load shaving, are introduced as influential factors in the economic feasibility of the UMHS that can be achieved through deploying sustainable stormwater management strategies and considering real-time analysis in the volatile energy market. Furthermore, simulation-optimisation tools are concisely presented for both the design and operation stages. Finally, some future research directions are offered to clarify the role of urban UMHS in addressing water and energy issues as individual systems or integrated into other decentralised energy sources.

AB  - Several species of ants are common in cities and are therefore included in studies of urban ecology. Here, I describe and categorize some aspects of the available literature on urban ants to better understand what has been studied and what is known by mapping well-studied areas and important gaps. Through systematic review techniques, I identified 109 relevant studies in the literature, and most (37.96 % of the publications) investigated the ecology and biodiversity of these ants followed by studies that addressed invasive ants (30.56 %), the control of pest ants (19.44 %) and public health (pathogen vector ants) (12.04 %). The studies that addressed invasive ants and pest ant control tended to focus on exotic species and their ecology, and the most tested type of control was the use of chemical pesticides. The most frequently used species for these tests was Linepithema humile, which was also the most studied invasive species. I identified a scarcity of studies in highly urbanized cities in countries located in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America and South America with the exception of Brazil. I suggest that those topics that have not been studied in the literature, such as the influence of air pollution on ant fauna and the explicit recommendations for the handling and conservation of native species in urban green areas, be placed on the agenda of the scientific community as points of concern.

AB  - The objective of this review was to synthesize existing evidence on GIS and RS application in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policy and practice for improving agriculture sustainability and identifying obstacles to their application, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Systematic searches were conducted in the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, Bielefeld Academic Search Engine, COnnecting REpositories (CORE), and Google Scholar. We identified 2113 articles published between 2010-2021, out of which 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. The results show that GIS technology application in agriculture has gained prominence in the last decade, with 66% of selected papers being published in the last six years. The main GIS application areas identified included: crop yield estimation, soil fertility assessment, cropping patterns monitoring, drought assessment, pest and crop disease detection and management, precision agriculture, and fertilizer and weed management. GIS technology has the potential to enhance agriculture sustainability through integrating the spatial dimension of agriculture into agriculture policies. In addition, GIS potential in promoting evidenced informed decision making is growing. There is, however, a big gap in GIS application in sub-Saharan Africa, with only one paper originating from this region. With the growing threat of climate change to agriculture and food security, there is an increased need for the integration of GIS in policy and decision making in improving agriculture sustainability.

AB  - Under the influences of climate change, human activities and socioeconomic development, the water resources management (WRM) has become more complex and uncertain. The paper visualizes and quantifies the knowledge base, domain and structure of the WRM using the bibliometric analysis and knowledge map. The visualized knowledge maps are used to investigate the development trend, scientific collaboration, subject categories, core research topics and the newest research fronts of the WRM. 9028 publications on the WRM were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection databases for the period of 1990-2018. Results indicated that the research on the WRM maintained an increasing trend for the past 29 years. China contributed the most publication, and Germany cooperated the most with other countries/regions, which were two active contributors of the WRM research. The co-word analysis and burst detective analysis of keywords showed that climate change and ecosystem were the research hotspot of the WRM knowledge base. The co-occurrence analysis and burst detective analysis of subject categories found that the Environmental Sciences & Ecology and Green & Sustainable Science & Technology were the core direction of the WRM knowledge domain. Solving the practical problems through model simulation was the core of the WRM knowledge structure under the changing environment using the cluster analysis and document co- citation analysis. It is suggested that the WRM managers should take the sustainable and adaptive development as goal, ensure the health and integrity of the ecosystem, integrate stakeholders into the WRM, which should help to make the WRM more adaptable under changing environment.

AB  - Happiness Economics is an expanding field, with a growing number of studies due to the convolution in the disciplines of social sciences. The current trends in welfare economics have witnessed an increase in quantitative research approaches, reporting empirical associations between happiness and other variables. These approaches, however, have been limited only in the area of the economic sector, specifically focusing on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper takes a broader view of the topic, with the aim of identifying the research progress and the emerging trends in happiness economics. We provide a systematic literature review based on a bibliometric analysis, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Text-based cluster analysis was performed to identify the most prominent themes in the literature through cluster identification via VOSViewer and R Studio. The findings highlight five major emerging research themes, namely: (i) Paradoxes of happiness research in Economics; (ii) Happiness Economics: Bringing back Ordinalism?; (iii) Beyond GDP: Sustainability and subjective well-being; (iv) Policies to achieve welfare and happiness economy; and (v) Happiness management and organisational culture to improve productivity. Finally, on the basis of emerging themes, we propose future research propositions for each of the themes. Results demonstrate that happiness economics has a potential to address present needs and future engagements to build a better economic system and a happier society. The study provides novel and significant contributions to the existing literature by providing evidence of the past and current practices of happiness economics. Significant implications for the prospective stakeholders further improve the contribution of research.

AB  - People with disabilities have high rates of chronic health conditions and often require complex medication regimens to manage their health. Approximately 20-50% of people with disabilities fail to take their medication as prescribed. It is unclear, however, to what extent the literature describes the effectiveness of medication adherence interventions for people with disabilities. In this review, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the 182 studies included in the Cochrane Review on Interventions for Enhancing Medication Adherence were evaluated for their inclusion of people with disabilities. Of the studies, 1% excluded persons for hearing impairment, 3% for motor impairment, 7% for visual impairment, and 32% for cognitive impairment. Most studies (65%) did not exclude persons based on specific impairment. Medication event monitoring systems were used in 21% of studies, and investigators excluded people unable to use this device in 5% of studies. Caregiver assistance was an exclusion criteria in 4% of studies. Additional barriers like the ability of investigators to exclude persons based on their judgement were found. These barriers exist in addition to the known barriers affecting persons with disabilities, such as accessibility of research facilities and access to transportation. These data suggest that people with disabilities are systemically excluded from the medication adherence intervention literature. Subsequently, it cannot be assumed that current adherence interventions are effective for people with disabilities. More research is needed to understand how to address medication adherence for people with disabilities.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) involves the practice of concurrent minimum tillage, permanent soil cover using crop residue, and crop rotation. Evidence indicates that CA increases agricultural productivity, reduces farming labour requirements, and improves soil quality. While CA is practised in several African contexts, little is known about its interaction with gender. This review synthesized knowledge on the interplay of gender and CA in sub-Saharan Africa. The review highlighted the relative neglect of gender issues in research on CA in SSA. Existing research was limited both in quantity and to a few countries in the region. There was also little critical focus on gender as a social phenomenon: a few of the studies conceptualized gender in terms of the socially constructed roles of men and women while the majority framed it in terms of the sexual categories of male and female. Compared to men, and due largely to gendered barriers, including lack of access to land; machinery; inputs; extension services; and credit facilities, women farmers adopted CA less and dis-adopted it more. CA increased women's incomes, labour involvement, household food security, as well as risks for land and crop dispossession by men when farming becomes lucrative. It also increased workloads, employment opportunities and health risks for women. CA positively altered gender relations, boosting women's participation in agricultural decision-making at the household level. Deliberately enlisting women as beneficiaries; working with men to advance their understanding of women's needs in agriculture; and offering agricultural inputs directly to women are some strategies that enhanced women's participation in CA. Gaps in current research on gender and CA include: critical focus on and understanding of gender as a social construct in relation to CA; the long-term impacts on CA for gender relations, incomes for men and women, and women's empowerment; the sustainability of strategies for supporting gendered participation in CA; and the dynamics of gendered access to local farmland markets for CA.

AB  - Water bodies vary widely in terms of environmental stability, and most of this variation is due to water permanence. Permanent systems are expected to have a more stable community since the organisms will not be subjected to the severe disturbances caused by droughts. Temporary habitats are stressed by frequent dry phases, which reset the system and trigger succession processes that can drive changes in species composition. Previous studies have found higher beta diversity among permanent than among temporary water bodies, whereas others have found the opposite. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the beta diversity of aquatic invertebrates in permanent and temporary water bodies and assess whether there is a predominant relationship between beta diversity and water permanence. Our results revealed that the beta diversity of invertebrates did not differ between permanent and temporary habitats. Primary studies showed both patterns: some of them presented higher beta diversity in permanent than in temporary water bodies, whereas others presented the opposite, resulting in a net effect of no difference. The lack of a clear pattern may result from the interaction with multiple factors, including hydrological specificities of the study areas, scales, and dispersal abilities of the organisms investigated, as well as environmental and anthropogenic factors.

AB  - Accessing the world's oceans is essential for monitoring and sustainable management of the maritime domain. Difficulty in reaching remote locations has resulted in sparse coverage, undermining our capacity to deter illegal activities and gather data for physical and biological processes. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) have existed for over two decades and offer the potential to overcome difficulties associated with monitoring and surveillance in remote regions. However, they are not yet an integral component of maritime infrastructure. We analyse 15 years of non-autonomous and semi-autonomous USV-related literature to determine the factors limiting technological diffusion into everyday maritime operations. We systematically categorised over 1,000 USV-related publications to determine how government, academia and industry sectors use USVs and what drives their uptake. We found a striking overlap between these sectors for 11 applications and nine drivers. Low cost was a consistent and central driver for USV uptake across the three sectors. Product 'compatibility' and lack of 'complexity' appear to be major factors limiting USV technological diffusion amongst early adopters. We found that the majority (21 of 27) of commercially available USVs lacked the complexity required for multiple applications in beyond the horizon operations. We argue that the best value for money to advance USV uptake is for designs that offer cross-disciplinary applications and the ability to operate in an unsheltered open ocean without an escort or mothership. The benefits from this technological advancement can excel under existing collaborative governance frameworks and are most significant for remote and developing maritime nations.

AB  - BackgroundThe risk of destructive wildfire on fire-prone landscapes with excessive fuel buildup has prompted the use of fuel reduction treatments to protect valued resources from wildfire damage. The question of how to maximize the effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at landscape scales is important because treating an entire landscape may be undesirable or unfeasible. We reviewed 86 simulation studies that examined landscape-scale fuel reduction treatment effectiveness for landscapes of the USA or Canada. Each of these studies tested effects of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire through comparisons of landscape scenarios differing by treatment design or other attributes. Results from these studies were summarized to assess what they reveal about factors determining fuel treatment effectiveness at landscape scales.ResultsQualifying studies focused primarily but not exclusively on forested landscapes of the western USA and ranged in size from 200 to 3,400,000 ha. Most studies showed that scenarios with fuel reduction treatments had lower levels of wildfire compared to untreated scenarios. Damaging wildfire types decreased while beneficial wildfire increased as a result of treatments in most cases where these were differentiated. Wildfire outcomes were influenced by five dimensions of treatment design (extent, placement, size, prescription, and timing) and other factors beyond the treatments (weather, climate, fire/fuel attributes, and other management inputs). Studies testing factorial combinations showed that the relative importance of these factors varied across landscapes and contexts.ConclusionsSimulation studies have highlighted general principles of effective fuel treatment design at landscape scales, including the desirability of treating extensive areas with appropriate prescriptions at sufficient frequency to reduce wildfire impacts even under extreme conditions that may be more prevalent in the future. More specific, context-dependent strategies have also been provided, such as a variety of placement schemes prioritizing the protection of different resources. Optimization algorithms were shown to be helpful for determining treatment placement and timing to achieve desired objectives under given constraints. Additional work is needed to expand the geographical scope of these studies, further examine the importance and interactions of driving factors, and assess longer-term effects of fuel reduction treatments under projected climate change.

AB  - Context Landscape connectivity plays a key role in determining the persistence of species inhabiting fragmented habitat patches. In dynamic landscapes, most studies measure connectivity at multiple time steps, but pay less attention to explicitly quantifying its temporal dynamics to gain insights into its role in biodiversity patterns, thereby enabling more effective operational outcomes. Objectives This article aimed at making an overview of the existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity. By analysing their differences and possible applications, we aimed to highlight knowledge gap and future research directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature dealing with the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity and obtained 32 studies. Results We presented two main approaches based on graph theory and compared them from conceptual and operational perspectives. The first widely used approach, accounting only for the spatial dispersal of organisms, quantifies temporal changes in spatial connectivity. Based on two or multiple time steps in the time series, this approach enables assessment of the sense and magnitude of the temporal changes in spatial connectivity. The second recently developed approach quantifies spatio-temporal connectivity, thus accounting for both spatial and temporal dispersal. So far, this holistic assessment of spatio-temporal connectivity only covers two time steps. Conclusion Existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity provide indicators to advance our understanding of biodiversity patterns, and to be able to implement measures to conserve and restore connectivity. We propose future directions to develop these methods.

AB  - Climate-resilient crops and crop varieties have been recommended as a way for farmers to cope with or adapt to climate change, but despite the apparent benefits, rates of adoption by smallholder farmers are highly variable. Here we present a scoping review, using PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), examining the conditions that have led to the adoption of climate-resilient crops over the past 30 years in lower- and middle-income countries. The descriptive analysis performed on 202 papers shows that small-scale producers adopted climate-resilient crops and varieties to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, flooding and salinity. The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers' access to inputs-especially seeds and fertilizers-and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies. On the basis of the collected evidence, this study presents a series of pathways and interventions that could contribute to higher adoption rates of climate-resilient crops and reduce dis-adoption.
   Climate-resilient crops are essential for farmers to adapt to climate change. This scoping review identifies extension services and outreach as the most important factors for their adoption by small-scale producers in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - The consistent gender gap in financial inclusion over time is postulated by World Bank Findex data despite an increase in the overall financial inclusion level around the globe. Women's financial inclusion is significant in line with the promotion of gender equality- one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations. Academic literatures have fragmented studies on women's financial inclusion and there is a dearth of systematic literature review to comprehend the overall literature landscape in analyzing research gaps. This article is an attempt to conduct a structured systematic literature review to identify factors impacting women's financial inclusion, the associated gender gap and importance of promoting greater financial inclusion for women. Literature reviews are important to map the existing landscape of a study problem and develop further knowledge. This study reviews 75 peer reviewed articles from 2000 to 2021 and presents the findings in a comprehensive manner following a conceptual model. Synthesized evidence reveal the existence of gendered financial inclusion mainly due to demand side factors. Various socio-economic and cultural factors are also seen to influence women's financial exclusion. Based on the mapping of existing findings the study suggests future research directions where emerging themes lie in the areas related to digital finance, financial self-efficacy and financial literacy which are important for enhancing women's financial inclusion.

AB  - Primates are among the most observable and best studied mammalian orders, yet the distribution of sampling effort by primatologists has inevitably concentrated on a few genera and a limited number of study sites. We present the first systematic review of sampling effort and associated biases in wild primate field research, focusing on dietary studies across the Neotropics. Our literature review of all 24 neotropical primate ecospecies spans 42 years (1969-2011) and covers 290 dietary studies at 164 study sites across 17 countries. We use a standardized measure of sampling effort to assimilate data sets derived from multiple methodologies and attempt to understand the distribution of effort (total equivalent to 193,804 h) using geographic variables and primate species traits. Results indicate that there are both geographic and taxonomic biases, with sampling effort generally skewed towards large-bodied species occupying large geographic ranges, and concentrated at a select few primatology research hubs. We also note that full primate assemblages at any given study site are rarely investigated. Our assessment thus reveals severely undersampled primate taxa and geographic regions that must be considered in future research. Current biases could be ameliorated by deliberately targeting poorly studied genera anywhere in their geographic distribution, well-studied genera in poorly studied regions, and striving to study multiple sympatric taxa within a single site. Although continued inequalities in sampling effort are probably inevitable, this study shows that this need not inhibit successful compilations and meta-analyses, provided that adequate data on feeding records and sampling effort can be made available.

AB  - Talent Management (T.M.) constitutes a modern and emerging research area in Human Resources Management (HRM). Using a systematic literature approach, we searched in Talent Management literature in the healthcare sector context. We conclude that the number of related studies is minimal. The benefits of implementing Talent Management strategies in healthcare organizations are essential for the organization's sustainable development and the talented staff and healthcare services patients. Our goal is to undertake a systematic literature review to identify these factors related to talent management practices suitable for healthcare organizations and professionals. We have conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review (2010-2020) in the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Health Source/Nursing Academic Edition. Search terms related to T.M. were ("Talent Management" AND "Talent Healthcare"). Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were set for observational studies, while grey and unpublished literature, uncontrolled studies, protocols, commentaries, and conference proceedings were excluded. All included items were assessed for their quality according to set criteria. Six hundred and eighty-four studies were identified, of which 24 met the requirements. The resulting Talent Management Factors were grouped into nine categories: Programming, Attraction, Development, Preservation, Performance Assessment, Work Climate, Culture, Succession Planning, and Leadership. Based on these factors, we provide a holistic picture of the referred domain's leading developments. The paper determines the Talent Management factors and explains what happens in practice. In this way, we contribute to building a theoretical framework for T.M. in terms of the organizational context.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change contributes to increased frequency and intensity of droughts, wildfires, storms, coastal sea level rise, and population displacements, in addition to causing lung and cardiovascular diseases from the emission of Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs). The aviation sector is estimated to contribute 2%-3% of global anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This excludes GHG emissions from airport operation and maintenance activities due to limited research in the area. This systematic literature review examined the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) carried out by previous studies on the environmental impacts of airport operation and maintenance activities. This allows to assess existing literature on the impacts of these activities; identify knowledge gaps in LCA based on the findings of the review; and propose areas for further research and improvement in mitigating the environmental impacts of airport operation and maintenance activities. A total of 11 papers were selected for thematic analysis and narrative synthesis following a systematic review process based on the research question which yielded a total of 263 peer-reviewed research articles and dissertations on the topic. The findings of the review showed that knowledge gaps exist in the LCA of environmental impacts of Auxiliary Power Units (APU) and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) operations in the airport during aircraft turnaround time. Further research is suggested in the use of feasible and affordable alternative energy sources (electricity, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen) at airports to reduce the environmental impacts associated with petrol- and diesel-powered GSE and gate operations at airports.

KW  - Motivations
KW  - Recommendations
AB  - The environmental challenges in cities urge people to explore feasible strategies for resilient, sustainable, healthy and livable built environments, of which designing and building green roof (GR) is an important approach. Whilst extensive studies have been proving GR benefits in energy, environmental and ecological aspects, GR implementation (GRI) for achieving such multi-benefits has received limited attention. In order to facilitate GRI, therefore, this paper aims to delineate factors that can affect GRI. This study conducted a systematic review of 186 published papers from 2000 to 2019, for the identification of drivers, motivations and barriers to the GRI. The results indicate that the drivers to GRI include policy pressure, market pressure, and innovation and technology advancement. Besides, GRI can be potentially motivated by multiple factors including energy efficiency, urban heat island mitigation, roof longevity prolongation, air purification, runoff control, water purification, urban infrastructure improvement, sound insulation and noise reduction, biodiversity increase, recreation and aesthetics, property value enhancement and employment improvement. Nevertheless, GRI can be constrained by several barriers such as a lack of government policy, unsound technological level, unsound economic benefit assessment and individual unwillingness. According, this study proposed strategic recommendations in policy, technical, economic and social aspects, with the considerations of various GRI stakeholders (e.g. designer, engineer, constructor and builder, contractor, building operator, owner, end-user, government agent), to strengthen GRI drivers, foster GRI motivations and overcome GRI barriers. Overall, this study is of significance to inform the people with knowledge of factors affecting GRI, which can further promote researchers to explore interrelationships among multiple factors on the one hand and can further promote decision-makers to develop sound policies on the other for GR adoption.yy

AB  - Food loss and food waste are recognized as two of the most challenging dilemmas facing the world today with serious repercussions on food security, the environment, and global as well as regional and national economies. This is not different in the Arab countries where the food loss and food waste generated per person sometimes exceeds 210 kg per year. Literature searches indicate there is a paucity of applied studies that investigate the drivers, sources, management, quantification, policies, interventions, and initiatives to reduce food loss and food waste in the Arab world, a region with more than 400 million inhabitants. Despite the importance of the topic, only twenty-five relevant articles were identified, providing limited data on food loss and food waste generation. The studies also use sampling procedures that do not allow for generalization of results over the Arab region or even for making comparisons among studies. The review concludes that further research on food loss and food waste along the food supply chain in the Arab world is necessary with a focus on trends, causes, and social, technological, behavioral, attitudinal, and cultural drivers. Investigating environmental and economic implications along with policy development and coping strategies, as well as consumer attitudes towards waste in general and food waste in particular are also important topics to be researched, especially given the variation in cultural and religious practices across the Arab world. The generation of such information and knowledge is indispensable for taking remedial action towards mitigating the problem of food loss and food waste.

AB  - For the energy transition, Social Innovation (SI) has been defined as innovations that contribute to the low carbon energy transition, civic empowerment, and social goals through initiatives such as new forms of governance, social configurations, supportive policies and regulations, and new business models. This work systematically reviews the literature to identify (potential) impacts of SI and bottom-up initiatives on sustainable energy transitions. Based on bibliometric and qualitative content analysis, works were classified by the type of SI, related renewable energy source, and geographical context. Associated sociotechnical changes, obstacles, and enabling factors of SI are also indicated. Main findings show that SI has an important role in local transitions but limited power to challenge the regime and scale-up. For just energy transitions, it can facilitate energy access, coproduction, energy democracy, and participatory processes besides bringing regional socio-economic development and building community capacity. SI can contribute to renewable energy deployment through co ownership and community finance. Also, community-led actions are in a unique position to access local tacit knowledge, influence individual behavior, and use them to build more sustainable cities. Finally, research limitations and directions towards future research are presented.

AB  - Despite increasing concern that climate change may negatively impact trout-a globally distributed group of fish with major economic, ecological, and cultural value-a synthetic assessment of empirical data quantifying relationships between climatic variation and trout ecology does not exist. We conducted a systematic review to describe how temporal variation in temperature and streamflow influences trout ecology in freshwater ecosystems. Few studies (n = 42) have quantified relationships between temperature or streamflow and trout demography, growth, or phenology, and nearly all estimates (96 %) were for Salvelinus fontinalis and Salmo trutta. Only seven studies used temporal data to quantify climate-driven changes in trout ecology. Results from these studies were beset with limitations that prohibited quantitatively rigorous meta-analysis, a concerning inadequacy given major investment in trout conservation and management worldwide. Nevertheless, consistent patterns emerged from our synthesis, particularly a positive effect of summer streamflow on trout demography and growth; 64 % of estimates were positive and significant across studies, age classes, species, and locations, highlighting that climate-induced changes in hydrology may have numerous consequences for trout. To a lesser degree, summer and fall temperatures were negatively related to population demography (51 and 53 % of estimates, respectively), but temperature was rarely related to growth. To address limitations and uncertainties, we recommend: (1) systematically improving data collection, description, and sharing; (2) appropriately integrating climate impacts with other intrinsic and extrinsic drivers over the entire lifecycle; (3) describing indirect consequences of climate change; and (4) acknowledging and describing intrinsic resiliency.

AB  - ObjectivesBetween 2012 and 2017, the Mindful Self-Care Scale (MSCS) was crafted and refined through a rigorous, evidence-based process. From 2017 to 2023, the instrument was validated across an array of cultural contexts. Despite these promising results, no research has consolidated item-level data to evaluate the psychometrics of the measure across various cultures. This study sought to examine the intercultural validity of the MSCS.MethodsRetrospective instrument meta-analysis with Rasch modeling, factor analysis, and data drawn from 16 studies among five continents, Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, and North America (n = 5,658).ResultsRasch and Factor Analysis indicated that measurement properties of the MSCS were reliable and valid in all 16 studies. The MSCS (33-item) showed good internal structure, validity, and invariance, to support generalizability of its scores in varied cultural settings. The Brief-MSCS (24-item) had a stronger internal structure with parsimony for well-being applications.ConclusionsThe MSCS (33-item and 24-item) were both reliable and valid among culturally and occupationally varied samples. With wide factorial scope and proven psychometric robustness, the MSCS serves as a useful tool for assessing mindful self-care preferences and values across heterogeneous ethnic, cultural, and occupational landscapes. Rasch and invariance testing further supported the human needs-based self-care theory used to operationalize the MSCS. The only negative item in the measure (PC6), was not adding value and could be removed. Future research should investigate mind-body practice in self-care and their relationship to other mindfulness constructs.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

AB  - Urban agriculture initiatives are increasing in numbers. Projects are being created on all continents and in all kinds of cities large or small. The Covid-19 crisis has also increased the awareness of public authorities to the participation of this agriculture to food provisioning for some populations but also for its participation to social resilience of the city. Studies have been done to evaluate the impact of urban agriculture on city sustainability and tools have been developed to measure it at several scales from the city to the project. The private sector has also begun to work on tools to evaluate the sustainability of urban agricultural projects to help public authorities and landowners choose project to install in new places. With such a plethora of tools, do we still need to work on this subject? As the existing tools do not apply at the same scale, do not rely on the same goals of sustainability and are not always very transparent about their workings? The first step to answer all these questions is through a systematic review of published tools in scientific reviews. Therefore, the objective of this review is to compare the identified tools according to several criteria (scale, type of urban agriculture evaluated, sustainability dimensions studied, complexity/number/type of indicators, public availability, etc.). This will enable us to identify both the conditions under which existing tools can be used, gaps in the existing pool of resources but also the gaps in knowledge to measure some part of UA sustainability and identified technical and organisation levers than can improve UA sustainability. The first pool of analysed articles shows the use of existing frameworks in half of them whereas half developed their own systems and sometimes indicators. Nearly all tools are based on the three sustainability pillars (environmental, economic and social) even though they are sometimes redesigned for the tool in different categories.

KW  - INFORMATION
AB  - Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are increasingly striving to deploy actions that promote the efficient use of energy and other resources on university campuses. Successful sustainability initiatives are vastly described in literature, especially for the operations phase. In turn, reports on unsuccessful cases are small in number, or are overlooked and undiscussed, possibly providing a biased view of reality, thus hiding eventual failures. The main objective of this article is to highlight those latter cases and discuss the causes of such results. Through a systematic review of empirical-based scientific literature on ineffective or less successful sustainability actions in the areas of 'Energy' and 'Buildings' on campus operations, it was possible to identify common potential triggering factors for the unsuccess. These were classified into four groups according to the number of occurrences in literature: technical, economic, climatic and behavioral. Within these groups, the main causes include: inadequate planning, the inappropriate design of systems, the lack of proper maintenance, the low return on investment, mismatch between the actions and the local climate, or the uncertainty of long-term commitment to a sustainable behavior. Based on these findings, a set of lessons were disclosed for each group, which may be helpful for all those who are involved in decision-making, planning or monitoring of sustainability actions on campus, as a means to help anticipate and overcome difficulties in early phases. Lastly, more empirically based literature is encouraged, as the disproportion between information on the description of actions and on their impacts is notorious. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in Central and South America are exposed to climate-related hazards (sea-level rise, climate variability and storms) which threaten the assets (people, resources, ecosystems, infrastructure, and the services they provide), and are expected to increase due to climate change. A non-systematic review is presented focusing on vulnerability elements, impacts, constraints to adaptation, and their possible strategies. The analysis emphasises the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g., threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves, and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will, and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards. Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already implemented. In addition to specific thematic measures, the implementation of non-structural approaches, National Adaptation Programmes of Action and early warning systems, based on the reasons for concern, should foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas.

AB  - PurposeThe study aims to work on two objectives, first to provide a theoretical foundation along with ongoing trend in the field of green human resource management (GHRM) and employee green creativity (EGC) in the hospitality and tourism industry. Second, the study also proposes a conceptual research model to understand the dynamics of the relationship between GHRM and EGC for future studies.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses multi-method approach, systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis is performed on published work on GHRM and EGC. This study initially shortlisted 52 publications from multiple databases, which was refined to 11 Scopus-indexed papers, which discussed both GHRM and EGC attributes in a hospitality context. VOSviewer and advance excel software's are being used to perform the analysis.FindingsThe systematic literature review concluded that very limited studies have been conducted on GHRM and EGC in the hospitality context and it has recently gained prominence during the covid pandemic. While bibliometric analysis also identified h-index authors with their co-authorship network, citations and keywords matrix and the changing trends in the domain of GHRM and EGC in hospitality and tourism industry. The analysis also highlights the individual and organisational factors influencing the relation between GHRM and EGC.Originality/valueThis study is the first to conduct a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis on GHRM and EGC in hospitality and tourism sector. Moreover the paper also provides researchers with an in-depth summary of the available literature and a blue print for future studies on GHRM and EGC.

AB  - Social capital (SC) is highlighted as an important factor for post-crisis mental health outcomes. However, the heterogeneous nature of the construct makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the evidence concerning the association between SC indices and mental health. This review examines how SC is conceptualized and measured, and the relationships with other variables in quantitative empirical studies investigating the associations between SC and mental health in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts. It includes primary data studies focusing on this association in civilian populations. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, bibliographic mining, cited reference searching, and personal contact with experts. In total, 15 studies were included: 12 in post-natural disaster contexts and 3 in conflict-affected settings. Findings suggested that individual cognitive SC had an inverse association with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and that ecological cognitive SC was positively associated with mental well-being. Individual structural SC (in the form of community networks) may be psychologically protective. However, most of the evidence was cross-sectional, limiting conclusions about causal relationships. More clarity and consistency is needed in the conceptualization and measurement of SC in order to inform post-crisis mental health interventions.

AB  - Concerns regarding the development of environmental accounting have been around for decades. This work is an update to some of the previous questions around the development of ecological accounting to see how this has changed over the last two decades. The work is based on a systematic review of two journal articles from separate accounting journals. The two articles are by widely published academics and are formative ecological management accounting papers highlighting issues since 2000. The analysis includes a comparative review of the two articles, a review of successive articles in the journals, and a citation analysis. The first general finding is around the complex and confusing terminology that is still used, exemplified in the amorphous term sustainability. Specific findings from the paper analysis include ecological management accounting requires a fundamental change to organization management, different values exploring relationships such as material flows, inclusive of the living and physical world, with a longer time horizon, and a centrality of external factors. Due to these challenges, ecological management accounting is presently not used as a research category and therefore is an un-developed research domain. Environmental accounting is a more commonly used synonym for ecological accounting, though this term is distinct and does not cover many of the ecological challenges. Under this research area, there have more recently been attempts to bridge the difficult macro (planetary) and micro (organization) environmental challenge. Concepts such as Accounting for the Management of Ecosystems and Material Flow Cost Accounting are areas of research seen as offering future opportunities to develop into a more ecological management accounting framework, though this will ultimately require research in ecological management accounting based on a multi-disciplinary approach.

AB  - Interest in sustainability and its relation to performance has grown significantly among practitioners and operations management (OM) scholars. However, there is still a paucity of research on the antecedents and drivers of sustainability, as well as on the relationship between sustainability and performance. Moreover, the literature offers contradictory results on this relationship. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide a research synthesis about the overall state of the art of empirical research on the impact of sustainability management practices on performance, encompassing social and environmental dimensions. To achieve this goal, the authors develop a rigorous systematic review of the extant literature on sustainability relationships with firm performance, emphasizing the under-researched area of causal models of sustainability and operational performance. This research is a first attempt to go beyond the highly dispersed work on the subject, aiming to provide more generalizable evidence about theories, methods and findings. The synthesis embraces 231 papers in total and identifies the main variables on causal models depicting the relationships between sustainability and performance, analyses how the studies on the subject are conducted, and investigates the impact and the mechanisms through which sustainability affects operational performance (OP). Overall, there are positive effects of sustainability on performance, such as lower costs, better delivery and product quality, enhanced volume and mix flexibility, although different mechanisms drive the sustainability-performance links and they differ according to contexts. The study outlines implications for practice and future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim This review explored peer-reviewed and grey literature to describe the types and characteristics of food or food-related waste management strategies used in hospital food service settings; their financial, environmental and staffing outcomes; and the barriers and enablers associated with their implementation. Methods Six electronic databases, 17 Google Advanced searches, and 19 targeted websites were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Literature reporting the financial, environmental, or staffing outcomes of food or food-related waste management strategies that reused, recovered energy from, or recycled waste instead of sending it to landfill were eligible. Document screening and review were completed in duplicate, and included peer-reviewed literature were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised narratively. Results Four peer-reviewed and 81 grey literature records reported 85 strategies. When grouped from most to least favourable according to the food recovery hierarchy they managed waste by: donating surplus food (n = 21); feeding animals (n = 2); industrial use (n = 11); composting (n = 34) and other (n = 17). These approaches had the capacity to reduce waste hauling fees (n = 14), reduce staff handling of waste (n = 3), and decrease the amount of waste sent to landfill (n = 85). Barriers included contamination of waste streams, while enablers included leadership and time-neutral changes. Conclusion This review summarises the waste management strategies used by hospitals worldwide that divert food and food-related waste from landfill, their outcomes, and position in the food recovery hierarchy to enable hospital food services to implement appropriate practice and policy changes to decrease their environmental footprint.

AB  - Serious Games (SG) is a pedagogical approach with technical integration of entertainment and knowledge. Even though this approach has been applied in construction, most of the studies have focused on specific areas, such as sustainability and construction safety. Therefore, a general representation of SG applications in construction is in-evident. This gap creates uncertainties and lack of directives on the know-what and know-how of SG in construction. A systematic review and detailed content analysis of 50 post-screened articles related to SG in construction/building have depicted the current state and consolidated view on the applications of SG in construction. The applications of SG were categorized into several subject matters, such as construction safety, management and fire evacuation. Further, an overall classification system for SG in construction has been established, by including elements such as user and purpose. Based on the established classification, a SG process framework was developed and the framework could serve as a reference for construction stakeholders/game developers in designing games for their needs. The main outcome from this study (classification and process framework) would benefit the academic and industry practitioners, as the establishments could guide game development in construction, particularly in empowering construction education and training.

AB  - Neither breast cancer prevention and early-detection programs, nor their outcomes, are uniform across Europe. This article describes the rationale, methods, and process for development of the European Commission ( EC) Initiative on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis Guidelines. To be consistent with standards set by the Institute of Medicine and others, the EC followed 6 general principles. First, the EC selected, via an open call, a panel with broad representation of areas of expertise. Second, it ensured that all recommendations were supported by systematic reviews. Third, the EC separately considered important subgroups of women, included patient advocates in the guidelines development group, and focused on good communication to inform women's decisions. Fourth, EC rules on conflicts of interest were followed and the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to structure the process and minimize the influence of competing interests. Fifth, it focused its recommendations on outcomes that matter to women, and certainty of the evidence is rated for each. Sixth, the EC elicited stakeholder feedback to ensure that the recommendations remain up to date and relevant to practice. This article describes the approach and highlights ways of disseminating and adapting the recommendations both within and outside Europe, using innovative information technology tools.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the differences between Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Mainland in terms of education and also the influence of it on doing comparative educational research. Hong Kong SAR is ruled by the Chinese Government under the framework of "One country, two systems." It makes Hong Kong SAR different from other Mainland cities based on different aspects including, education. The finding of this paper provides a systematic review about the differences between these two Chinese societies in terms of education and also implication for conducting comparative educational research in these two societies and also generating some implications for cross-national and cross-cultural study in education. Design/methodology/approach This paper made references from the framework proposed by Bray and Thomas (1995) in relation to comparative educational research to make comparison between Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Multi-level comparison is conducted between two societies in terms of education, especially aspects relating to conducting educational research sat social, school and individual levels. Findings This paper identified the influence of "One county, two systems" on education at different levels such as ideology, school management system and use of languages in teaching. Such differences affect the choice of topics, sampling strategy, research design, data analysis and interpretation and also ethical considerations when conducting comparative research between Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Originality/value This paper is an integrated analysis of conducting educational research in two Chinese societies and provides insights for further discussions and possible research about this topic.

AB  - Sexual violence (SV) is a widespread public health and human rights problem, with countries in East Africa having higher rates than the global average. Prosecutions of SV in East Africa are rare, and survivors face many challenges accessing medico-legal justice and services. Developing initiatives that support survivors in navigating the criminal justice system is vital, yet there is limited research on efforts to improve the criminal justice system's management and treatment of survivors. We conducted a scoping review of research on initiatives to strengthen responses toward investigating and prosecuting cases. We identified 25 academic articles and reports through a search of electronic databases and gray literature that address these initiatives in East Africa. The results reveal that seven types of initiatives have been studied: one-stop centers (OSCs), multisectoral referral networks, gender desks, community interventions, mobile applications, and specialized police and prosecution units. Upon review, we found that barriers to success include a lack of resources and facilities, a lack of trained health care, police, and judicial personnel to perform services, weak medico-legal partnerships, and stigma and impunity restricting the uptake and fair distribution of services. Overall, limited systematic evidence on the effectiveness and adaptability of initiatives exists, showing that SV interventions in East Africa remain an under-researched and under-resourced area, and need greater scientific rigor to inform practice and coordinated advocacy. This review is a call to action for policy makers and service providers working in East Africa-and for international bodies working toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals 5-to improve criminal justice initiatives.

AB  - PurposeA majority of consumers are supportive of socially responsible companies making positive contributions to their communities. However, results of empirical studies on consumers' attitudes toward corporate social responsibility (ACSR) and their purchasing intentions (PI) have been inconsistent. The purpose of this paper is to measure the strength of association between ACSR and PI. This study also aims to examine the moderating effects of firm characteristics (product type and commitment to green/sustainability initiatives), consumer demographics (gender and age) and external factors (geographic region). Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a systematic search, which yielded 28 studies that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis (total participants = 12,242). This study used meta-analysis to examine the association between ACSR and PI using random effects analyses. Subgroup analyses and meta regression were used to detect moderators in the meta-analysis. FindingsThe main result showed that the average weighted correlation (r+) was 0.478, indicating that ACSR had a strong positive relationship with PI. Subgroup analyses indicated geographic region and product type had no significant moderating effect on the relationship between ACSR and PI. However, the difference for commitment to green initiatives was marginally significant. The high levels of heterogeneity (Q = 535.199, I-2 = 94.955) and a possible absence of publication bias were evident in the meta-analysis. Originality/valueThis meta-analysis can make meaningful contributions to the existing body of knowledge on corporate social responsibility by testing the influence of the important moderators that include geographic region, product type and commitment to green initiatives.

AB  - Objectives Most studies have been concerned with the experiences and needs of spouses/partners and adult children of people with dementia. In this review, children and young people's lived experience of parental dementia was investigated. Findings will inform both researchers and professionals in the area of dementia care.
   Design A systematic literature search was performed in CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A rigorous screening process was followed, and a checklist for qualitative and observational studies was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. Narrative synthesis of the selected articles was carried out.
   Results Twenty-one studies were included and a synthesis of the literature revealed six themes. The first theme concerned the difficulties in dealing with the diagnosis which was often preceded by a long period characterized by uncertainty, confusion, family distress, and conflicts. The second theme discussed changes in family relationships in terms of the role of children and young people in supporting both parents and keeping family together. The third theme described the impact of caring on children and young people who struggled to balance caring tasks and developmental needs. The fourth theme showed consequences on children and young people's personal lives in terms of education/career and life planning. The fifth theme illustrated main adaptation models and coping strategies. The last theme discussed the need for appropriate support and services based on a "whole family" approach.
   Conclusions The included studies provide the basis for knowledge and awareness about the experience of children and young people with a parent with dementia and the specific needs of support for this population.

AB  - Organophosphate esters (OPEs), chemicals widely used in industrial production, electronics and domestic products, have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants. In this study, the levels and spatial distribution of 11 OPEs (aryl, alkyl and halogenated) were investigated in over 100 samples of filter-feeding bivalves collected yearly between 2014 and 2021 at sites of contrasted pressure along the French coasts. OPEs were found in virtually all samples, indicating their widespread spatial and temporal occurrence in coastal bivalves and the relevance of their biomonitoring. The median concentrations were between 0.4 (TMPP) and 4.9 ng g(-1) dry weight (TCIPP), with TCIPP, TNBP and EHDPP found at the highest median values. TCEP and TBOEP were not frequently detected overall, but each year, the same sites showed repeatedly high concentrations. Structurally-related OPEs generally correlated, but the geographical distributions were not predictable from known anthropogenic pressures (population in the catchment area, industry), with little comparability with other hydrophobic contaminants. If the relation between sources of OPEs and bioaccumulated levels remains uncertain, local hotspots, rather than riverine/atmospheric transportation, could account for their geographical distribution. A systematic review of the levels of OPEs found in filter-feeding bivalves worldwide revealed comparable levels in our study with those reported elsewhere; however, the levels across and within (when available) studies generally spanned several orders of magnitude, indicating high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In view of the growing concerns regarding OPEs, this study provides essential reference data for future studies of their occurrence on European coasts and supports the need for a more systematic (bio)monitoring of this class of contaminant.

AB  - Background: Significant differences exist between feminine and masculine lower extremities, and this region contributes to gender dysphoria in transgender and nonbinary individuals.Methods: A systematic review was conducted for primary literature on lower extremity (LE) gender affirmation techniques as well as anthropometric differences between male and female lower extremities, which could guide surgical planning. Multiple databases were searched for articles before June 2, 2021 using Medical Subject Headings. Data on techniques, outcomes, complications, and anthropometrics were collected.Results: A total of 852 unique articles were identified: 17 met criteria for male and female anthropometrics and 1 met criteria for LE surgical techniques potentially applicable to gender affirmation. None met criteria for LE gender affirmation techniques specifically. Therefore, this review was expanded to discuss surgical techniques for the LE, targeting masculine and feminine anthropometric ideals. LE masculinization can target feminine qualities, such as mid-lateral gluteal fullness and excess subcutaneous fat in the thigh and hips. Feminization can target masculine qualities like a low waist-to-hip ratio, mid-lateral gluteal concavity, calf hypertrophy, and body hair. Cultural differences and patient body habitus, which influence what is considered "ideal" for both sexes, should be discussed. Applicable techniques include hormone therapy, lipo-contouring, fat grafting, implant placement, and botulinum toxin injection, among others.Conclusions: Due to lack of existing outcomes-based literature, gender affirmation of the lower extremities will rely on application of an array of existing plastic surgery techniques. However, quality outcomes data for these procedures is required to determine best practices.

AB  - The emergence and spread of Lyme disease and other infections associated with black-legged ticks is causing a public health crisis. No human vaccines are currently available, and both diagnosis and treatment are sometimes ineffectual, leading to advocacy for self-directed preventative measures. These recommendations are widely communicated to the public, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. We undertook a systematic review and mixed-effects meta-regression analysis of factors purported to increase or decrease risk of black-legged tick bites and tick-borne disease. Published articles used in the study spanned the years 1984-2018. Variables associated with increased probability of tick-borne disease, with odds ratios significantly greater than 1, included deer abundance, high density of nymph-stage black-legged ticks, landscapes with interspersed herbaceous and forested habitat, low human population density, gardens, cat ownership, and race. Contrary to recommendations, use of landscape-related tick control measures, such as clearing brush, trimming branches, and having a dry barrier between lawn and woods, tended to increase risk. Pet ownership increased bite risk. Bite risk was highest for children aged 5 years or less, with a secondary peak in persons aged 50-70 years. Although some widely disseminated recommendations are supported by the research analyzed, others require further evaluation. Additional research is also needed to understand the mechanisms underlying significant relationships.

AB  - Plant viral diseases are the foremost threat to sustainable agriculture, leading to several billion dollars in losses every year. Many viruses infecting several crops have been described in the literature; however, new infectious viruses are emerging frequently through outbreaks. For the effective treatment and prevention of viral diseases, there is great demand for new techniques that can provide accurate identification on the causative agents. With the advancements in biochemical and molecular biology techniques, several diagnostic methods with improved sensitivity and specificity for the detection of prevalent and/or unknown plant viruses are being continuously developed. Currently, serological and nucleic acid methods are the most widely used for plant viral diagnosis. Nucleic acid-based techniques that amplify target DNA/RNA have been evolved with many variants. However, there is growing interest in developing techniques that can be based in real-time and thus facilitate in-field diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based innovative methods have shown great potential to detect multiple viruses simultaneously; however, such techniques are in the preliminary stages in plant viral disease diagnostics. This review discusses the recent progress in the use of NGS-based techniques for the detection, diagnosis, and identification of plant viral diseases. New portable devices and technologies that could provide real-time analyses in a relatively short period of time are prime important for in-field diagnostics. Current development and application of such tools and techniques along with their potential limitations in plant virology are likewise discussed in detail.

AB  - Urban transport provides access to multiple services, structures and impedes daily life of residents, and translates into wellbeing considerations, sustainability impacts, and GHG emissions. Thus motivated, multiple disciplines, ranging from psychology to urban planning, are invested in understanding the potential for transitioning to low-carbon and sustainable urban transport systems. While each discipline has carved out a growing body of knowledge, a consistent cross-disciplinary understanding of psychological, sociological, and urban form determinants of urban mobility choices is, perhaps surprisingly so, still lacking. Here, we systematically review the reviews of several strands of literature and lay out the evidence for individual, social, and infrastructure level factors pertinent to urban mode choice. Synthesizing the results from 75 review papers, we find that all three dimensions (individual, social, and infrastructure) unambiguously interfere with mode choice. Individuals are most motivated to shift modes, if they are well informed, if personal norms match low-carbon mode use, and, most importantly, if they perceive to have personal control over decisions. Perceptions about common travel behaviour (descriptive social norms), especially if supported by perceived normative beliefs of others (injunctive norms), are highly influential to support mode shift. However, the overall margin of shift as induced by individual and social settings remains limited. Instead, the infrastructure factors explain large differences in mode choice. New shared mobility modes, and teleworking and shopping, add a long tail to modes chosen, but are no game changer. We conclude that a transition to low-carbon mobility requires low-carbon infrastructure, which leverages enthusiastic individuals' concerns and empowers them for mode change, and that address safety concerns prevalent especially in cities of the Global South. The mode shift to low-carbon option can then be sustained and enhanced by social influence in the form of collective social norms.

AB  - Autonomous vehicle (AV) is an innovative transport option that has the potential to disrupt all industries tied to transportation systems. The advent of AV technology will bring a novel on-demand mobility pattern such as shared autonomous vehicle (SAV). To promote AV technology, it is important to understand which factors influence travelers' intention to use AVs and SAVs. This paper collected literature from databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect, and made a systematic review. The study aims to explore the determinants that influence travelers' behavioral intentions towards use AVs and SAVs based on an extended version of the theory of planned behavior, which incorporates knowledge and perceived risk. This study was tested empirically using a valid survey sample collected from 906 respondents in China. Structural equation model was conducted to investigate the predictors of intentions to use AVs and SAVs. Results showed that knowledge about AV technology and perceived risk are the two main potential obstacles for travelers to use AVs and SAVs. Attitude significantly affects AVs and SAV choice intentions. Subjective norm is the most critical factor affecting the travelers' intention to use AVs. Perceived behavioral control potentially stymie the travelers' intention to use SAVs. The findings will enhance the understanding of travelers' choice motivation from psychological and service perspectives, and provide data support for governments and companies in improving travel management strategies and product services.

AB  - Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM) are important for safety performance evaluation, since crashes are rare events and historical crash data does not capture near crashes that are also critical for improving safety. This paper focuses on SSM and their applications, particularly in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) safety modeling. It aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of significant SSM studies, identify limitations and opportunities for future SSM and CAV research, and assist researchers and practitioners with choosing the most appropriate SSM for safety studies. The behaviors of CAV can be very different from those of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV). Even among CAV with different automation/connectivity levels, their behaviors are likely to differ. Also, the behaviors of HDV can change in response to the existence of CAV in mixed autonomy traffic. Simulation by far is the most viable solution to model CAV safety. However, it is questionable whether conventional SSM can be applied to modeling CAV safety based on simulation results due to the lack of sophisticated simulation tools that can accurately model CAV behaviors and SSM that can take CAV's powerful sensing and path prediction and planning capabilities into crash risk modeling, although some researchers suggested that proper simulation model calibration can be helpful to address these issues. A number of critical questions related to SSM for CAV safety research are also identified and discussed, including SSM for CAV trajectory optimization, SSM for individual vehicles and vehicle platoon, and CAV as a new data source for developing SSM.

AB  - Himalayan countries face many ecological challenges, including biodiversity loss and the many threats of climate change. In response, these countries are implementing Nature-based Solution to minimize these challenges and promote sustainable development. In this article we analyze the NbS programs implemented across the Himalayan region and assess the limitations of these NbS using the IUCN standard criteria of adherence to NbS for selected articles. We perform a systematic review of articles using the PRISMA methodology, through the Scopus, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases and followed by screening through the Rayyan web interface. Articles were screened out based on the location and lack of biodiversity and human well-being outcomes of NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions in the Himalayas primarily use a sustainable management approach (35.29%), followed by restoration (23.53%), conservation (11.76%), holistic management (11.76%), eco-DRR (11.76%) and green infrastructure (5.88%) to address societal and climatic challenges. Institutional execution of NbS was 29.41% more common compared to the implementation of NbS by community or farmer groups. Pineapple based agroforestry (83.04%), forest restoration (78.57%), spring water storage (83.04%), spring restoration (86.61%), groundwater recharge (82.14%), bio-fertilizer and pesticides (77.68%), watershed restoration (78.57%), community-based watershed management (77.68%), community-based DRR (81.25%), community-based forest management (81.25%), sustainable harvest of medicinal plants (77.68%) and wetland restoration (82.14%), adhere to the IUCN criteria. In addition, some interventions adequately meet IUCN criteria, such as ice stupas (72.32%), forest restoration through plantation (73.21%), eco-safe roads (65.18), blue-green infrastructure (68.75%), and traditional ecological knowledge (72.32%). Our evaluation noted that NbS interventions can be improved by precise planning and design before implementation, engaging multiple stakeholders, comparing alternative solutions, and periodic monitoring of the impacts on the environment and society. This study shows that NbS in the Himalayas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and climate risk management. Tackling the limitation of this present review, mainly the exclusion of research not addressing biodiversity and human well-being, will yield more precise outcomes for climate actions and sustainable development.

AB  - With the rural revitalization strategy was proposed in 2017, large-scale land consolidation has been carried out in rural areas of China, which has profoundly impacted rural development and sustainability. To assess the multi-dimensional effects of land consolidation on rural revitalization, an evaluation system was constructed following the proposed "target-indicator-outcome" framework and subsequently applied to 193 cases documented in 92 peer-reviewed articles for a systematic review and meta-analysis. The results indicate that rural land consoli-dation had played more positive than no/negative roles in facilitating rural revitalization, with cases reporting generally positive outcomes accounting for 74%. Considering four targets of rural revitalization, positive effects were statistically significant in the case of Prosperous Life and Industrial Prosperity, with positive cases ac-counting for 86% and 79%. However, the positive effects in terms of Ecological Livability and Rural Civilization & Effective Governance is statistically non-significant, with positive cases accounting for 65% and 47%. In terms of 12 indicators, an overview of the positive and no/negative effects brought by land consolidation were sum-marized. The cases of the indicators related to rural producting and living were largely positive, however, the indicators related to rural ecology, rural civilization and governance reported higher no/negative outcomes. From the perspective of spatial differentiation, the positive effects were significant in eastern, central and western China, and the proportion of positive cases in eastern China (80%) and western China (77%) were higher than those in central China (67%). The opportunities and threats of rural land consolidation in multi-dimension deserve policy attention in rural revitalization strategy.

AB  - China is currently the largest CO2 emitter in the world and demonstrates one of the highest levels of energy consumption. The sustainable consumption behavior has increased in China, especially in urban cities. Some clear evidence of this includes food purchasing behavior. Recent studies have also suggested that considering full product information transparency, consumers are willing to pay premium prices for products. With this in mind, sustainable consumption must still be facilitated by related policies, regulations, and tools. This study focuses on sustainable consumption behavior in China and collects and analyzes the literature from the last decade (2007-2017) on the topic. In so doing, it highlights new trends and research topics against the background of circular economy development. The method of systematic review is applied. The review is categorized into several main groups: national policies and regulations, the green awareness of consumers, the definition of related concepts, the barriers between sustainable consumption and the circular economy, and the indicators for circular economy assessment in China. Future research directions are discussed. Furthermore, future challenges are addressed from three perspectives: sustainable consumption facilitating the circular economy, "cradle-to-cradle" practices, and the link between the European Union and China. This is a fundamental study in the research domain of sustainable consumption behavior. It provides added value that benefits both academic researchers and decision makers. It also sheds light on the further study of sustainable consumption behavior in China from a macroeconomic perspective.

AB  - Although there is wide recognition of the importance of entrepreneurship for generating societal impact, entrepreneurial activities alone rarely achieve a positive impact without the engagement of communities. To date, however, entrepreneurship researchers have tended to overlook the importance of community for creating societal impact through entrepreneurship, and lack a comprehensive understanding of the nature and roles of communities. To address this, we conduct a systematic review of the literature published in 51 journals across the Management and Entrepreneurship, Economic Development/Community Development, Economic Geography and Regional Science, Energy, and Public Administration disciplines that makes three contributions. First, it identifies a new typology of community and proposes a comprehensive framework of roles through which societal impact is created by entrepreneurship for, in, with, enabled by, and driven by communities. Second, it demonstrates that the key to understanding how community relates to societal impact creation is to jointly account for both its type(s) and role(s). By linking community types and roles, the findings also suggest a theoretical contribution based on the relationship between the degree of formalization of a community type, and the degree of agency that a community role enacts. Third, the review underscores that communities are not just static settings but can also be dynamic actors in efforts to use entrepreneurship to create societal impact. Our cross-disciplinary review highlights trends and gaps in the extant literature and provides researchers with an evidence-based research agenda to guide future inquiry on this vital topic.

AB  - Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea and S. aquaticus) causes major losses to agricultural revenue and induces livestock morbidity throughout parts of Europe, North America, and Australasia. The introduction of legislation in the U.K. and Australia has meant that landowners can be prosecuted if the plant spreads to adjacent land, which has led to an increase in activities attempting to control these species. Commonly used interventions include natural enemies, herbicide applications, manual and mechanical removal. Through the use of explicit systematic methodology involving comprehensive searches and detailed inclusion criteria, data from primary research are collated for each type of intervention. Meta-analyses show that 2,4-D, Asulam, Clopyralid, and MCPA are effective at reducing ragwort densities. However, when the datasets were analysed for their effectiveness against individual species, 2,4-D and MCPA were only effective against S. jacobaea, while Asulam was only effective against S. aquaticus. Natural enemies Longitarsus jacobaeae and a combination of L. jacobaeae and Tyria jacobaeae appear to have the potential to reduce S. jacobaea densities. Only applying T. jacobaeae does not appear to significantly reduce S. jacobaea densities, but does reduce the number of capitula per plant, seeds per capitula, viability of seeds, and dry weight of the plants. There is insufficient experimental evidence available to assess other interventions such as manual or mechanical removal. Further research into these types of interventions is recommended, as well as more detailed reporting of site characteristics and experimental design to allow full investigation of each intervention to explain possible reasons for variations in their effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose - The study aims to define a research agenda for creating resource-efficient supply chains (RESCs) by identifying and analysing their key characteristics as well as future research opportunities.
   Design/methodology/approach - We follow a systematic review method to analyse the literature and to understand RESC, taking a substantive theory approach. Our approach is grounded in a specific domain, the agri-food sector, because it is an intensive user of an extensive range of resources.
   Findings - The review shows that works of literature has looked at the use of resources primarily from the environmental impact perspective. There is a need to explore whether or not and how logistics/supply chain decisions will affect the overall configuration of future food supply chains in an era of resource scarcity and depletion and what the trade-offs will be.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper proposes an agenda for future research in the area of RESC. The framework proposed along with the key characteristics identified for RESC can be applied to other sectors.
   Practical implications - Our research should facilitate further understanding of the implications and trade-offs of supply chain decisions taken on the use of resources by supply chain managers.
   Originality/value - The paper explores the interaction between supply chains and natural resources and defines the key characteristics of RESC.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to review the current literature on Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) to answer the following questions: (1) What have the methodological issues been in the discussion on PEF, and how do the suggested updates address them? (2) What are the challenges of using PEF in policies and how can these be resolved? Method The research questions were answered through a structured literature review of publications on the PEF method. The search was conducted in three databases, Scopus, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect, using the search words "Product Environmental Footprint," "Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules," and "PEFCR." Results and discussion The methodological issues in the PEF method have caused ongoing discussions. Some of the identified issues have been addressed by a subsequent update of the PEF guidance, but there are still some significant issues. These are as follows: The defined functional units in the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) are inadequate to ensure a fair comparison of products, impact categories for biodiversity and indirect land use change are still being developed, the existing and new PEFCR need to adopt a benchmarking method, uncertainty exists about how the costs of making an LCA study are affected by PEF, and it is unclear how the results of a PEF study should be communicated. Conclusion The PEF method could play an essential role in developing a market for green products, but it has met substantial criticism from academia. Some of the issues identified in the criticism are addressed by the updated PEF method, but there are still significant issues that should be addressed to improve the PEF method.

AB  - Digitalisation in railway networks harnesses digital technologies to optimise operations, leading to enhanced efficiency, and reduced energy consumption. By analysing real-time data, railways can predict maintenance needs, improve passenger experiences, and seamlessly integrate with other transport modes. As societies strive for sustainable transportation solutions, it is imperative to understand and collect digitalisation techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of railway networks. This paper serves as a snapshot of the current state of the art addressing the pivotal role of point cloud techniques in advancing railway digitalisation and providing valuable pointers for future research directions. Employing a systematic review approach, our study concentrates exclusively on research centred around railway assets and their digitalisation via point cloud data. We have themed the literature into pre-processing, modelling, and digital twinning. Within this review, we analyse diverse modelling and pre-processing techniques and categorise them for clarity. The digital twin techniques are also collected, though these techniques are scarce in the context of railway infrastructure and point clouds. The paper also presents a compilation of dataset statistics highlighting the scarcity of openly available railway-specific datasets. This scarcity considerably hampers the feasibility of research reproducibility and the comparative analysis of different approaches. Our conclusion reflects on the challenges encountered and proposes a course for future research. Particularly, we conclude that hybrid methodologies that combine machine learning with structure-based techniques hold substantial promise toward creating digital twins, considering the intrinsic characteristics of railway infrastructure.

AB  - As the United Nations plans to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all," great attention is paid to deploying sustainable networked microgrids to fulfill the future energy demand. Several neighboring low-voltage microgrids in a fixed or dynamic electric boundary will form a Multi-Microgrid. The unprecedented deployment of microgrids, brilliant communication, and infrastructure enable the concept of multi-microgrids to be an operational exemplar in future distribution networks, and it paves the way to deliver critical loads against all odds. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the evolution of networked microgrids with deep insight into the most critical research areas, opportunities, and challenges in energy management and control. Their operation and control in coordination with medium voltage distribution networks in time-varying loads and intermittent characteristics of renewable-based distributed generation sources are challenging for both distribution network and microgrid operators. Further, the complexities involved in the multiple control layers in the multi-microgrid network need appropriate strategies for optimal sharing and trading among neighboring microgrids. Numerous solutions based on advanced distribution control, reinforcement learning, adaptive deep neural networks, and game theory were reported in the literature. A systematic review of various energy management strategies, optimization scheduling frameworks, and multi-microgrid voltage and frequency control strategies are presented. Then, a detailed survey on hierarchical, decentralized, and distributed control architectures is reported. Finally, a comprehensive overview of research objectives and more than 30 solution methodologies with respect to both energy management and control is illustrated.

AB  - Global road mortality is a leading cause of death in many low-income and middle-income countries. Data to support priority setting under current resource constraints are urgently needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.6. This Series paper estimates the potential number of lives saved if each country implemented interventions to address risk factors for road injuries. We did a systematic review of all available evidence-based, preventive interventions for mortality reduction that targeted the four main risk factors for road injuries (ie, speeding, drink driving, helmet use, and use of seatbelt or child restraint). We used literature review variables and considered three key country-level variables (gross domestic product per capita, population density, and government effectiveness) to generate country-specific estimates on the potential annual attributable number of lives that would be saved by interventions focusing on these four risk factors in 185 countries. Our results suggest that the implementation of evidence-based road safety interventions that target the four main road safety risk factors could prevent between 25% and 40% of all fatal road injuries worldwide. Interventions addressing speed could save about 347 258 lives globally per year, and at least 16 304 lives would be saved through drink driving interventions. The implementation of seatbelt interventions could save about 121 083 lives, and 51 698 lives could be saved by helmet interventions. We identify country-specific estimates of the potential number of lives saved that would be attributable to these interventions. Our results show the potential effectiveness of the implementation and scaling of these interventions. This paper presents key evidence for priority setting on road safety interventions and shows a path for reaching SDG 3.6.

AB  - Agriculture plays an imperative role in many countries' economies and is a substantive source of survival. The variation in a soil nutrient decreases crop yield. An accurate soil fertility classification and application of fertilizers are essential for enhancing crop productivity. Currently, soil fertility levels are assessed through laboratory testing of soil samples, and fertilizers are applied randomly. This traditional practice increases fertilization costs and causes environmental pollution. Thus, it is necessary to develop robust and inexpensive soil fertility classification and fertilizer application. This study identifies the machine learning (ML) or deep learning-based soil fertility classifications. A comprehensive review is conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The purpose of this study is to examine different approaches that researchers use to predict or classify soil fertility. It also discusses the fertilizer recommendation developed by the researchers. The earlier research showed that ML-based approaches could accurately classify soil fertility. Furthermore, this study discusses the importance of soil nutrients and preventive measures to be taken on the imbalance of soil nutrients. This study explores research gaps and challenges in soil fertility classification and fertilizer recommendation systems. Most studies predicted the fertility levels of soil parameters, whereas a few researchers classified soil fertility. Few researchers recommended fertilizers for soil nutrient depletion. Most studies relied on expensive laboratory measurements or regional soil data collected from satellites. Based on the identified research gaps, this study suggests potential future research possibilities in soil fertility classification and the recommendation of fertilizers. It aims to develop a low-cost soil fertility classifier to prescribe fertilizers. The developed model can help farmers to enhance soil fertility with reduced fertilization costs.

AB  - Mercury is a metal found in the environment from natural and anthropogenic sources. It is highly toxic to ecosystems and living beings. Most human exposures come from ingestion of contaminated seafood, outgassing from dental amalgam or occupational exposure (e.g. gold mining), among other cases. Large populations are exposed to mercury, making it a very important issue from the public health perspective. Adverse health effects are commonly seen in the nervous system, but every organ is a potential target, such as the bone marrow. The main goal of this study was to assess the available evidence on human exposure to mercury and its hematological effects. A search strategy was constructed, including key terms (MeSH, text word and equivalents) for querying 2 repositories of master dissertation and PhD thesis (Fiocruz/ARCA and University of Sao Paulo) and 4 different electronic databases: BVS/LILACS, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and TOXLINE/NIH, for articles published from 1950 to February 2018. There was no language restriction and a tool (EPHPP) was used to assess the quality of included studies. According to pre-established criteria, 80 studies were retrieved, all of them observational (48 case reports, 24 cross-sectional, 6 case series and 2 cohorts), comprising 9,284 people. Despite the fact that most exposed ones (6,012) had normal blood cell count and mercury hematological effects did not seem very usual (1,914 cases: 14 severe and 29 deaths), three studies reported association (beta) for anemia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and basophilia. We concluded that the gathered information pointed to mercury hematotoxic effects, some of them may be serious and even fatal.

   Research Question/IssueThis paper seeks to provide a systematic review of the multidisciplinary theoretical approaches to women on boards in order to understand the factors that hinder and facilitate the access of women to boards, to show the instruments that can be used to promote women to senior corporate positions, and to outline a research agenda suggesting gaps that still need to be filled.
   Research Finding/ResultsWomen's access to boards appears to be fragmented in research silos from a variety of areas, lacking a comprehensive view that provides instruments to overcome the barriers hindering the access of women to corporate boards. More in particular, this paper has found very little scientific analysis to understand what instruments can be the most efficient in eliminating barriers for women to reach boardrooms given different cultural environments.
   Theoretical ImplicationsThis paper aims to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the presence of women on boards and for indicating existing gaps to be filled by new research in the future. This framework will help future researchers in analyzing specific instruments and to measure their efficiency in eliminating gender imbalance. Depending on the approach taken for research, the theoretical backgrounds used vary. While on the supply side the predominant theories are gender role theory, gender self-schema, and work-family conflict, the demand side is based on gender discrimination, human and social capital theory, resource dependence theory, and institutional environment theory.
   Practical ImplicationsThis research provides suggestions to typify causes and provide nuanced policy tools to promote women into leadership positions. Future lines of research are proposed to fill the gaps in understanding female representation in top management positions.

AB  - Global pollinator declines and land-use change can lead to pollination limitation with implications for agricultural productivity. Hand pollination is used in agricultural production as a technique to manually pollinate crops. But the prevalence of hand pollination, as well as benefits and costs, remain unknown. We systematically reviewed the literature for examples, methods, drivers, and economic motivations of hand pollination. Furthermore, we discuss the risks, constraints, and opportunities of hand pollination. We found evidence for 20 hand-pollinated crops, including minor but also economically important crops (e.g. apple, oil palm, cacao). The lack of pollinators was the most important reason for the application of hand pollination (50% of crops), while insufficient proportion or proximity of pollinizers (8% of crops) and skewed sex ratio or dichogamy (8% of crops) were second most important. The main economic motivations for practicing or recommending hand pollination were to increase fruit set, and/or fruit quality (78% of crops). Hand pollination is practiced in large- and small-scale farming, home gardens, and greenhouses. Opportunities of hand pollination are the control of pollen origin and quantity, pollination timing and frequency as well as independence from environmental fluctuations. Farmers can increase yields, improve fruit quality, avoid fruit abortion, increase employment, and secure subsistence food. The main constraints of hand pollination are high labor inputs, high material costs, and required skills. Major risks of hand pollination include management ignoring pollinator conservation, high food prices, over-pollination, labor accidents, and unfair labor. We conclude that in the face of global change, hand pollination allows improved control of pollination and is likely to increase in importance. The benefits of hand pollination need to outweigh the costs and fair labor is essential. Altogether, hand pollination can be a valuable tool for crop systems where pollinators are absent or are not reliable for sustaining high-quality crop production. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - In today's environment of the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), debate continues about whether it has beneficial effects on economic development. However, there is only a fragmented perception of what role and place AI technology actually plays in economic development (ED). In this paper, we pioneer the research by focusing our detective work and discussion on the intersection of AI and economic development. Specifically, we adopt a two-step methodology. At the first step, we analyze 2211 documents in the AI&ED field using the bibliometric tool Bibliometrix, presenting the internal structure and external characteristics of the field through different metrics and algorithms. In the second step, a qualitative content analysis of clusters calculated from the bibliographic coupling algorithm is conducted, detailing the content directions of recently distributed topics in the AI&ED field from different perspectives. The results of the bibliometric analysis suggest that the number of publications in the field has grown exponentially in recent years, and the most relevant source is the "Sustainability" journal. In addition, deep learning and data mining-related research are the key directions for the future. On the whole, scholars dedicated to the field have developed close cooperation and communication across the board. On the other hand, the content analysis demonstrates that most of the research is centered on the five facets of intelligent decision-making, social governance, labor and capital, Industry 4.0, and innovation. The results provide a forward-looking guide for scholars to grasp the current state and potential knowledge gaps in the AI&ED field.

AB  - Demand for rice labeled as organic is growing globally. Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don't influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn't analyzed statistically.

AB  - Introduction: This review aimed to compare the kinematic effect of nickel-titanium instruments with reciprocating and continuous rotation motion for cyclic fatigue resistance, shaping ability, apical debris extrusion, and dentinal defects or cracks. Method: Articles were selected for inclusion in this review if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: described in vitro studies performed on either extracted human teeth or an artificial canal model, assessed both reciprocating and rotary instruments, compared reciprocating files and rotary files for the kinematics of files, and evaluated reciprocating and rotary files regarding the aim of this study. The electronic search was undertaken in MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and manual searches, including journals, reference lists, and other reviews. Results: Twelve studies were chosen for cyclic fatigue, 19 studies for shaping ability, 14 studies for apical debris extrusion, and 13 studies for dentinal defects or cracks. Most of the studies showed that reciprocating motion had a higher resistance to cyclic fatigue. Nine studies from the shaping studies reported less canal transportation by using the reciprocating motion than the continuous rotation. The reciprocating instruments tended to extrude more dentin debris than the continuous rotating instruments, but many of the studies showed conflicting results. In addition, 2 studies from the defects or cracks studies claimed the reciprocating motion produced more dentinal defects than the continuous rotating motion. Conclusions: Instruments with reciprocating motion seemed to have better resistance to cyclic fatigue with less canal transportation tendency than the instruments with continuous rotating motion.

AB  - A rapid change in fast fashion has significantly accelerated the expansion of the volume of discarded clothing across the globe. Africa is the world's largest destination for second-hand clothes (SHC, sometimes known as 'Mitumba'). However, fewer studies have been conducted on Africa's SHC, making it challenging to evaluate the impact of the market and its value chain. This study examines the economic contribution and assessment of the SHC value chain and the resulting environmental challenges, identifies the trends of scholarly discourse on the topic in Africa, examines their methodologies and develops future research opportunities. The study shows that the SHC trade is an essential supply chain connecting developed and developing countries and a valuable clothing consumption alternative for people experiencing economic decline, poverty and low purchasing power. SHC is crucial in delivering fashion products to customers in underdeveloped African countries. It also creates job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of people in the trade, distribution, repairs, laundry services and upcycling. Results further show that Africans are being enriched with new skills and knowledge of the SHC trade, which is expected to help grow and promote small- to medium-sized enterprises. However, poorly made Mitumba become unmarketable, creating environmental challenges in cities across the continent. The study found fewer empirical studies, due largely to limited data on Africa's SHC trade. This calls for more empirical studies to scale the SHC trade in the region, expand the boundaries of entrepreneurial opportunities for Africa to interact with the global market, and alleviate the widespread problem of extreme poverty while also addressing the environmental challenges posed by SHC.

AB  - Using a meta-review approach organized historically in relation to critical policy incidents, this paper critically reviews the process of developing and (re) invigorating Environment and Sustainability Education (ESE) (policy) researchas ESE policy engagementover a 30+ year period in a rapidly transforming society, South Africa. It offers an example of long term policy-research meta-review in a context of policy flux. It adds to a body of international ESE policy studies that are seeking to understand and develop the ESE research/policy interface as this relation emerges under more complex conditions. In particular, we respond to the finding in the systematic review of ESE policy research undertaken by Aikens, McKenzie and Vaughter (2016) which reports a geographic under-representation of Africa (amongst other places) in ESE policy studies, and Gonzalez-Gaudiano (2016, 118)'s insight that ESE policy research in current neo-liberally dominated political conditions and as political process, is essentially an "open, unsteady, incomplete, and relational process". The Aikens et al. (2016) finding informed our decision to offer a substantive 'meta review' of 30+ years of ESE policy research in South Africa including approximately 150 studies, thus making this body of research more visible and available for scrutiny in the international ESE policy sphere, while also offering us an opportunity for the reflexive introspection that is advised for ESE policy studies by Van Poeck and Lysgaard (2016). The paper develops around a concept ofESE research as policy engagementoriented towards a 'politics of potentia'(Dussel,2008), framing the ESE policy-research meta-review within a theory of politics.

AB  - The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2014 was the most comprehensive to date. Yet it left several gaps with regards to the impacts, implications and responses to climate change in small island developing states (SIDS). SIDS are recognized as a special grouping of developing countries. Located in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Caribbean, and Pacific regions, they comprise 58 countries that are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and its impacts. With adaptation to climate change viewed as a viable and necessary complement to mitigation, academic interest in adaptation in these complex geographies is increasing. Despite this, not enough is known about the body of knowledge relating to adaptation in SIDS. This article systematically reviews 208 articles, books, book chapters, conference papers, and notes, and synthesizes the nature and extent of the research evidence before and after AR5 (i.e., from 1990 to 2014, and from 2015 to 2018). It specifically explores shifts in (a) when, where and by what means knowledge is being produced (e.g., subject areas, methodologies), and the ways in which adaptation is being framed (i.e., conceptually, operationally), (b) the narratives, consensuses, and tensions across the key emerging themes in the literature, and (c) the knowledge gaps that exist. It also outlines a future research agenda, which is an important consideration not only for multi-scale actors working to help solve the global climate challenge, but also for the scholars preparing the Small Islands Chapter of the Sixth Assessment Report due in 2021.

AB  - Understanding how invasive plants affect biodiversity is a crucial conservation need. Numerous studies examine impacts of invasions on birds, but trends in these effects have not been synthesized. We reviewed 128 studies from North America to quantify the frequency of positive, negative, and neutral (non-significant) effects of invasive plants on avian ecology, and then evaluated support for proposed mechanisms of impacts. Our frequency-based approach enabled us to draw value from the full breadth of available literature, including articles that do not provide information necessary for meta-analyses and articles examining understudied phenomena. Total avian abundance and prevalence of individual bird species were usually unaffected by invasion, with 48.9 and 57.2% of tests showing neutral results, respectively. Avian richness decreased with invasion in 41.3% of tests. Although birds often preferred nesting in invasive vegetation (45.0% of tests), effects on nest survival were typically neutral (57.9%). Multiple metrics (e.g. body condition, fledgling survival) have received scant attention. Some of the patterns we highlight differ across ecological contexts, emphasizing the need to understand impact mechanisms. Several studies have directly linked invasion impacts to altered nest-site availability, habitat heterogeneity, and food supplies. There is mixed evidence that plant architecture impacts nest-site selection and nest predation. Our review highlights the nonuniform consequences of biological invasions. The high frequency of reported neutral effects suggests that invasions often have minimal impacts on birds, but positive and negative impacts certainly can arise. Managers considering eradicating invasive plants for avian conservation should monitor impacts locally to determine whether eradication will be beneficial.

AB  - Background: The ramifications of climate change are rampant: All stakeholders must act effectively and swiftly. Unsustainable and increased urbanization adds additional strain on combatting environmental degradation. Since the last decade, urban distribution centers (UDCs) have emerged in response to the steep rise in urban freight transportation and its negative impact on city congestion and air quality. Methods: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of the performance of UDCs and investigate its alignment with the corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, including the shareholders' governance strategies and policies, as well as environmental, social, and economic measures. Our systematic literature review consists of multiple phases: In the first one, we utilize bibliometric tools to implement a quantitative analysis of the extant literature. Next, a cluster-based network analysis complements this analysis to describe the evolution of research in this area. Results: Our descriptive analysis categorizes existing research on UDCs based on CG- and CSR-compliant themes. We classify pertinent peer-reviewed articles into topical clusters and offer research opportunities related to improving the performance of UDCs. Conclusions: This study aims to stimulate further scholarly inquiry into sustainable city logistics and provides a knowledge-based guide for academicians and practitioners, logistics service providers, policymakers, and customers.

AB  - This article provides a conceptual framework for assessing and managing the university technology business incubator (UTBI) as a tool for new venture creation. It is widely believed that UTBIs contribute to the nurturing of new technology-based firms (NTBFs). However, they have escaped systematic review in the United States due to a lack of historical data. To fill this gap, a new UTBI performance assessment framework is proposed, which is drawn from a combined survey of the existing body of knowledge in the areas of business incubation, the university's involvement in technology and business development support, and the commonly accepted approaches to organizational assessment that provide the necessary building blocks for the integrative framework. The proposed model is comprised of three performance dimensions: (Ij program sustainability and growth; (2) tenant firm's survival and growth; and (3) contributions to the sponsoring university's,lzission. Further, the scope and effectiveness of the facility management policies, and the provision of services are assessed. The application of this framework is illustrated using four representative UTBI cases selected from a field of 30 five-year or older U.S.-based facilities and their 29 tenant firms our of the 84 firms contacted for the survey (35%). A comparative review of these four cases reveals that the framework provides a flexible methodology to assess the performance of UTBIs. The article concludes with a Set Of elements identified for evaluating UTBIs under the aforementioned three performance dimensions providing measurement indicators. This framework seeks to provide conceptual clarity for those responsible for assessing UTBI performance, directing their operations, or endeavoring to create them. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Herbicides are the primary tool for controlling weeds in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and are crucial to sustainable peanut production in the United States. The literature on chemical weed management in peanut in the past 53 yr (1970 to 2022) in the United States was systematically reviewed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different herbicides and identify current research gaps in chemical weed management. Residual weed control in peanut is achieved mainly with dimethenamid-P, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin, and S-metolachlor. More recently, the use of the protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor flumioxazin and acetolactate synthase inhibitors, such as diclosulam, for residual weed control in peanut has increased considerably. Postemergence broadleaf weed control in peanut is achieved mainly with acifluorfen, bentazon, diclosulam, imazapic, lactofen, paraquat, and 2,4-DB, while the graminicides clethodim and sethoxydim are the major postemergence grass weed control herbicides in peanut. Although several herbicides are available for weed control in peanut, no single herbicide can provide season-long weed control due to limited application timing, lack of extended residual activity, variability in weed control spectrum, and rotational restrictions. Therefore, effective weed management in peanut often requires herbicide mixtures and/or sequential application of preplant-incorporated, preemergence, and/or postemergence herbicides. However, the available literature showed a substantive range in herbicide efficacy due to variations in environmental conditions and flushes of weed germination across years and locations. Despite the relatively high efficacy of herbicides, the selection of herbicide-resistant weeds is another area of increasing concern. Future research should focus on developing new strategies for preventing or delaying the development of resistance and improving herbicide efficacy within the context of climate change and emerging constraints such as water shortages, rising temperatures, and increasing CO2 concentration.

AB  - Patient safety is an important issue in health systems worldwide. A systematic review of previous studies on patient safety culture in Southeast Asian countries is necessary for South Korea's partnership with these countries, especially given South Korea's assistance in strengthening the health systems of these developing countries. Studies on patient safety culture in Southeast Asian countries, published in English and Thai languages, were retrieved from computerized databases using keywords through a manual search. Data extraction, quality assessment, and analyses were performed using several tools. The review included 21 studies conducted in Indonesia (n = 8), Thailand (n = 5), Malaysia (n = 3), Vietnam (n = 2), Singapore (n = 1), and the Philippines (n = 1). They were analyzed and categorized into 12 dimensions of safety culture, and differences in response rate or scores were identified compared to the mean of the dimensions. The heterogeneous of safety culture's situation among Southeast Asian countries, both in practice and in research, can be explained since patient safety policy and its application are not prioritized as much as they are in developed countries in the priority compared to the developed countries. However, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos are the priority countries for South Korea's official healthcare development assistance in the Southeast Asia region. Vietnam, for instance, is an economically transitioning country; therefore, consolidated patient safety improvement by inducing patient safety culture in the provincial and central health system as well as strengthening project formulation to contribute to health policy formation are needed for sustainable development of the partner countries' health systems. It is recommended that more evidence-based proactive project planning and implementation be conducted to integrate patient safety culture into the health systems of developing countries, toward health policy on patient safety and quality service for the attainment of sustainable development goals in South Korea's development cooperation.

AB  - There is a rich body of literature on arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater and its consequences for human health via drinking water. Less is known however, on the impacts that flow from the use of arsenic rich groundwater for irrigation or the effectiveness of arsenic remediation in agricultural systems. To partially fill this gap, we review 29 studies that examine the consequences of irrigating with arsenic contaminated groundwater and 28 studies which evaluate interventions aimed at reducing its negative impacts on human health and crops. These studies are geographically limited to West Bengal and Bangladesh (Bengal plains) as these regions constitute hubs of concerns for groundwater contamination. These studies show that there are six broad categories of interventions: deficit irrigation; soil fertilization; growing alternative field crops (other than paddy); switching to arsenic tolerant paddy cultivars; cooking methods to reduce arsenic content in rice and nutritional supplements. Importantly, these efforts target different stages of the agri-food system, some intervene in production processes and balance concerns for crop yields and human health while others focus on consumption practices and only mitigate health risks. Despite this diversity in focus, our results indicate that all treatments have positive effects, either in reducing As content in grains, its accumulation in soil and/or increase crop yields compared to control groups. However, the extent of these impacts varies as do their implications for long-term agricultural sustainability. From a policy perspective, these interventions offer promising alternatives to the extremes of restricted groundwater use on the one hand, and unregulated extraction on the other, but are yet to be integrated into mainstream extension services.

AB  - In the conditions of the spread of globalization processes, growing interdependence, and interconnectedness of countries, a significant intensification of the academic society efforts to ensure national energy security and independence is necessary. The purpose of the paper is to provide a systematic review of the scientific environment aimed at analysing the contents and features of scientific publications dealing with new trends and patterns in sustainable energy consumption. In order to create a semantic and definition basis and research the main trends of scientific publications on the subject of developing energy efficiency and sustainable consumption, the paper carried out a bibliometric analysis concerning the categories << energy efficient >> and << energy consumption >> using the Scopus and VOSviewer tools. The main question is, what are the main scientific and research trends and patterns in the field of energy efficiency and sustainable consumption? For this purpose, the quantity and quality tendencies of the scientific articles which are studying issues connected with energy efficiency and sustainable consumer behaviour were determined. A sample of more than 24000 scientific publications on this issue was generated from publications indexed by the Scopus database. The study period covers 2001-2021. On the global level, the analysed investigated area is represented by the countries: China, the USA, and India. VOS viewer tools were used to systemize 5 clusters of scientific articles that analysed sustainable energy consumption from different points of view. Identification of regularities in the developing of scientific approaches to energy-efficient consumption and developing sustainable energy sector was carried out using bibliometric analysis, which has made it possible to describe the dominant retrospective evolutionary and temporal tendencies in the development of this theory concerning the concepts of sustainable development, environmental management, and development of renewables. As a result, one of the most significant trends is a green brand and tendencies connected with developing green marketing and green consumer awareness.

KW  - NEUROPATHIC PAIN
AB  - Objective To develop a clinical practice guideline for a simplified approach to medical cannabinoid use in primary care; the focus was on primary care application, with a strong emphasis on best available evidence and a promotion of shared, informed decision making.
   Methods The Evidence Review Group performed a detailed systematic review of 4 clinical areas with the best evidence around cannabinoids: pain, nausea and vomiting, spasticity, and adverse events. Nine health professionals (2 generalist family physicians, 2 pain management-focused family physicians, 1 inner-city family physician, 1 neurologist, 1 oncologist, 1 nurse practitioner, and 1 pharmacist) and a patient representative comprised the Prescribing Guideline Committee (PGC), along with 2 nonvoting members (pharmacist project managers). Member selection was based on profession, practice setting, location, and lack of financial conflicts of interest. The guideline process was iterative through content distribution, evidence review, and telephone and online meetings. The PGC directed the Evidence Review Group to address and provide evidence for additional questions as needed. The key recommendations were derived through consensus of the PGC. The guideline was drafted, refined, and distributed to a group of clinicians and patients for feedback, then refined again and finalized by the PGC.
   Recommendations Recommendations include limiting medical cannabinoid use in general, but also outline potential restricted use in a small subset of medical conditions for which there is some evidence (neuropathic pain, palliative and end-of-life pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury). Other important considerations regarding prescribing are reviewed in detail, and content is offered to support shared, informed decision making.
   Conclusion This simplified medical cannabinoid prescribing guideline provides practical recommendations for the use of medical cannabinoids in primary care. All recommendations are intended to assist with, not dictate, decision making in conjunction with patients.

AB  - Humans have altered ecosystems worldwide, and it is important to understand how this land use change impacts infectious disease transmission in humans and animals. We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30 years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9%) were observational, 30.8% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.

AB  - A scientific consensus acknowledges that climate change has increased wildfire activity in the Russian Arctic, a trend projected to continue in response to further warming. Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.

AB  - Renewable energy resource utilisation is becoming more prevalent in society and can be a sustainable method to meet rising energy demand and consumption. The International Renewable Energy Agency reports that presently, approximately 33% of total electricity output around the world is from renewable energy sources. However, in Nigeria, the World Bank reported this figure as 18.2% in 2015. It is important to understand how Nigeria can raise this average as the world moves towards less use of fossil fuels. Therefore, the aim of this work was to provide a review of the established literature, which can then be used to support the development of renewable energy systems in Nigeria. The methodology employed for the study of the literature involved a systematic review method, including identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion criterium steps. Understanding the national energy landscape is essential to support potential projects, and consequently, energy supply, demand and consumption in Nigeria are observed. The review examined renewable energy sources in Nigeria with a focus on solar and biomass/bioenergy. The levelised cost of electricity from renewable technologies was analysed, and the paper identified and evaluated past projects centered on solar and biomass, presenting three main case studies. The results indicate that solar and biomass have the most potential for energy generation in Nigeria, with 4-6.5 kWh/m(2) of solar irradiation available per day and approximately 2.3 x 109 GJ bioenergy potential per year. However, solar PV is currently of most interest in Nigeria due to the lower cost of on-grid solar PV electricity, which can comfortably compete with fossil fuels. Nevertheless, costs still need to be lowered to compete fully. Finally, the findings also indicate that there is an omission in the literature surrounding the existing renewable projects and technologies in Nigeria.

AB  - Soil erosion is a global issue of great concern, especially in karst areas with special environments, where subsurface soil leakage is closely related to soil erosion, which has become a key factor limiting agricultural development. To explore how to improve soil erosion in karst areas to enhance soil quality and maintain the sustainable use of the land in the long term, a total of 176 studies on the interception characteristics of soil mulching and erosion management were reviewed using a systematic review approach, through the WoS and CNKI databases. Firstly, quantitative analysis was conducted in terms of the annual volume, content and countries of the published literature. Secondly, from four aspects (theoretical research, mechanism research, technology research and technical demonstration), the main progress and landmark achievements of soil mulching interception and erosion management were classified. It is shown that the interception characteristics of soil mulching can produce an effective blockage for soil leakage in karst areas. Based on the global classification, compared to synthetic materials, natural materials have received more attention. We propose five key scientific questions that still need to be addressed. This review explores the insightful role of soil mulching for karst soil leakage management and aims to provide theoretical support for future research on sustainable land development in karst areas.

AB  - Precision Agriculture (PA) and Agriculture 4.0 (A4.0) have been widely discussed as a medium to address the challenges related to agricultural production. In this research, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) supported by a Bibliometric Performance and Network Analysis (BPNA) of the use of A4.0 technologies and PA techniques in the coffee sector. To perform the SLR, 87 documents published since 2011 were extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science databases and processed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) protocol. The BPNA was carried out to identify the strategic themes in the field of study. The results present 23 clusters with different levels of development and maturity. We also discovered and presented the thematic network structure of the most used A4.0 technologies in the coffee sector. Our findings shows that Internet of Things, Machine Learning and geostatistics are the most used technologies in the coffee sector, we also present the main challenges and trends related to technological adoption in coffee systems. We believe that the demonstrated results have the potential to be considered by researchers in future works and decision making related to the field of study.

AB  - One of the most crucial parts of solid waste management is determining landfill site location, since multiple factors must be considered and there is no universal formula. The main purpose of this study is to make a worldwide systematic review of restriction criteria used for landfill siting using geographic information systems (GIS). Literature from the last years was thoroughly assessed, and 45 restrictions found were classified as environmental, economic, or social criteria. Our findings show that although the number of articles published has increased recently, they use on average seven restrictions, focusing mainly on environmental over economic and social criteria. In our boxplot statistical analysis, the most frequently used environmental restrictions are the distance from surface water resources (used in 77% of articles), slope (52%), and distance from groundwater founts (40%), with a median of 300 m, 20%, and 250 m, respectively. The most frequently used economic restrictions are distances from roads (60%), airports (40%), and power lines (18%), with medians of 275 m, 3000 m, and 75 m, respectively. The most frequently used social restrictions are distances from urban areas (45%), settlements and residential areas (40%), and cultural heritage or archaeological areas (23%), with medians of 1000 m. This information might help, on the one hand, governments to develop new legislation about landfill siting and on the other hand, decision-makers and scientists to produce new studies with different restrictive scenarios.

AB  - Airborne particulate matter (PM) that is a heterogeneous mixture of particles with a variety of chemical components and physical features acts as a potential risk to human health. The ability to pose health risk depends upon the size, concentration and chemical composition of the suspended particles. Potential toxic elements (PTEs) associated with PM have multiple sources of origin, and each source has the ability to generate multiple particulate PTEs. In urban areas, automobile, industrial emissions, construction and demolition activities are the major anthropogenic sources of pollution. Fine particles associated with PTEs have the ability to penetrate deep into respiratory system resulting in an increasing range of adverse health effects, at ever-lower concentrations. In-depth investigation of PTEs content and mode of occurrence in PM is important from both environmental and pathological point of view. Considering this air pollution risk, several studies had addressed the issues related to these pollutants in road and street dust, indicating high pollution level than the air quality guidelines. Observed from the literature, particulate PTEs pollution can lead to respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular problems, lungs cancer, reduced lungs function, asthma and severe case mortality. Due to the important role of PM and associated PTEs, detailed knowledge of their impacts on human health is of key importance.

AB  - The imperial expansion of Rome resulted in an unprecedented intensification of industrial activity, including mining and metallurgical operations. Despite this is a well-known phenomenon, establishing the local narratives behind it is still problematic due to the inherent limitations of mining archaeology and palaeoenvironmental approaches. This paper offers a systematic review of metal palaeopollution records from ice, lake sediment and peat cores located in Europe and Greenland, analysing them together with mining archaeology evidence. Of the 89 cores reviewed within this work, 81 showed a discernible characteristic lead peak in Roman times. Of those, 44 were interpreted to be reflecting a macro-regional (hemispherical) pollution signal, another 22 as resulting from a local pollution source, and six showed contrasting evidence pointing towards both regional and local sources. Some of the local signals were identified by a lead isotope match with local ores, but in more uncertain cases the interplay between palaeoenvironmental and archaeological work was essential in order to attribute a local origin to the detected pollution trend. From this review, we conclude that the principal limitations in mining archaeology (establishing a chronology) and palaeopollution reconstructions (determining a source) can be overcome by considering in conjunction the information provided by both approaches.

AB  - Digital agriculture (DA) can contribute solutions to meet an increase in healthy, nutritious, and affordable food demands in an efficient and sustainable way. South America (SA) is one of the main grain and protein producers in the world but the status of DA in the region is unknown. A systematic review and case studies from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were conducted to address the following objectives: (1) quantify adoption of existing DA technologies, (2) identify limitations for DA adoption; and (3) summarise existing metrics to benchmark DA benefits. Level of DA adoption was led by Brazil and Argentina followed by Uruguay and at a slower rate, Chile. GPS guidance systems, mapping tools, mobile apps and remote sensing were the most adopted DA technologies in SA. The most reported limitations to adoption were technology cost, lack of training, limited number of companies providing services, and unclear benefits from DA. Across the case studies, there was no clear definition of DA. To mitigate some of these limitations, our findings suggest the need for a DA educational curriculum that can fulfill the demand for job skills such as data processing, analysis and interpretation. Regional efforts are needed to standardise these metrics. This will allow stakeholders to design targeted initiatives to promote DA towards sustainability of food production in the region.

AB  - Background: Most maternal deaths are preventable with emergency obstetric care; therefore, ensuring access is essential. There is little focused information on emergency transport of pregnant women. Objectives: The literature on emergency transport of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was systematically reviewed and synthesized to explore current practices, barriers, and facilitators for transport utilization. Search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BNI, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, African Index Medicus, ASSIA, QUALIDATA, RHL, and Science Citation Index (inception to April 2012) were searched without language restriction. Selection criteria: Studies using qualitative methodology and reporting on emergency transportation in LMICs were included. Data collection and analysis: Thematic framework and synthesis through examination and translation of common elements were used to analyze and synthesize the data. Main results: Twenty-nine articles were included. Eight major themes were identified: time for transport; transport options; geography; local support; autonomy; culture; finance; and ergonomics. Key issues were transport availability; transport speed; terrain; meteorology; support; dependence for decision making; cultural issues; cost; and lack of safe, comfortable positioning during transport. Conclusion: Themes should be appreciated within local contexts to illuminate barriers and facilitators. Potential solutions include motorcycle ambulance programs, collaboration with taxi services, community education, subsidies, and vehicle maintenance.

AB  - Objectives: To describe trends in major communicable diseases in Syria during the ongoing conflict, and the challenges to communicable disease surveillance and control in the context of dynamic, large-scale population displacement, unplanned mass gatherings, and disruption to critical infrastructure.
   Methods: A rapid review of the peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature from 2005 to 2015 was performed, augmented by secondary analysis of monitoring data from two disease early warning systems currently operational in Syria, focusing mainly on three diseases: tuberculosis (TB), measles, and polio.
   Results: Trend data show discrepancies in case report numbers between government and non-government controlled areas, especially for TB, but interpretation is hampered by uncertainties over sentinel surveillance coverage and base population numbers. Communicable disease control has been undermined by a combination of governance fragmentation, direct and indirect damage to facilities and systems, and health worker flight.
   Conclusions: Five years into the crisis, some progress has been made in disease surveillance, but governance and coordination problems, variable immunization coverage, and the dynamic and indiscriminate nature of the conflict continue to pose a serious threat to population health in Syria and surrounding countries. The risk of major cross-border communicable disease outbreaks is high, and challenges for health in a post-conflict Syria are formidable. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Global demand for vegetable oil and high oil palm yield have driven the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical countries. The research literature widely recognizes the effects of forest cover conversion into oil palm on biodiversity, deforestation, and carbon dynamics. However, research on the ecohydrological impacts of oil palm plantations is sparse, despite studies indicating that oil palm development may reshape land-water interactions and the availability and movement of water at different spatial and temporal scales. We address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on oil palm development and its relation to ecohydrological processes. We found 139 relevant papers up to the year 2021, addressing different ecohydrological processes related to oil palm. We reviewed their spatiotemporal scales, geographic distribution, oil palm species and age, and the effects of land conversion from forest, cropland, and pastures. We also incorporated societal aspects regarding community perceptions of water. Our review highlights the effects of oil palm plantations on three main components of the water cycle: (i) land-atmosphere, (ii) fluvial systems, and (iii) soils and groundwater. Most studies include analyses of the Indo-Malayan and Australasian biogeographical regions (113), followed by the Neotropics (49) and the Afrotropics (15). Compared to rainforests, oil palm monocultures are warmer and drier. They have higher evapotranspiration (ET) rates, lower runoff regulation and infiltration capacity, and lower soil organic carbon (SOC). Although less often implemented, alternative oil palm management practices, including oil palm agroforestry, can help to mitigate some of these effects. Forest to oil palm conversion is the most studied land transition, while conversions from croplands, pastures, and grasslands are less studied. Overall, we identify gaps in understanding the long-term effects of management on ecohydrological processes under different land conversions, especially in the Neotropics and the Afrotropics, precluding research-informed policy to manage impacts of this expanding crop.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities contribute to nearly half of current Hg emissions to the atmosphere. In the marine habitat, oceanic predator fishes bioaccumulate Hg throughout their lives, making their consumption the main route of Hg exposure in humans. In this context, several publications, between 1973 and 2022, were selected, analyzed, and duly compiled, with the objective to investigate Hg contamination in nine species of bony fish: Thunnus thynnus (8 publications), Thunnus albacares (19), Thunnus obesus (7), Thunnus atlanticus (5), Thunnus alalunga (4), Katsuwonus pelamis (8), Xiphias gladius (18), Coryphaena hippurus (7) and Euthynnus alletteratus (4), as well as two species of cartilaginous fishes Prionace glauca (13 publications) and Isurus oxyrinchus (8). These studies totaled 5973 individuals. We classified species according to taxonomic groups and region of capture and found a significant difference between sharks and bony fishes, with higher Hg concentrations in sharks. The regions of occurrence were divided into 4 large areas (North Atlantic - NAO, South Atlantic - SAO, Equatorial Atlantic Ocean - EAO, and Mediterranean - MED), but no significant differences were observed when comparing the overall Hg concentrations in fish among regions (including all species). Additionally, a thorough discussion of the risks associated with human consumption of these species was conducted, as nine of the selected species presented individuals with Hg concentration values that exceeded the safety limits (1 ppm) set by health agencies worldwide.

AB  - The 1992, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development highlighted that human impacts on the environment should be reduced. Against this backdrop, publications on restorative and regenerative urban design first appeared in the mid-1990s, and both disciplines have developed rapidly up to the present time. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the interrelationships and differences between these two terms, and their association with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Based on a search of the Web of Science database, a total of 117 papers were studied with the help of VOS viewer and R studio. The differences between the two disciplines and their respective associations with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals were analyzed using key performance indicators. Detailed analysis was used to explore their current development status. Scientific publication and citation network analyses were used to examine the historical developments and interrelationships between two disciplines. The review revealed that both disciplines are closely related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially regenerative urban design, but they have developed independently in the field of urban design. Unlike the descriptions found in many of the identified papers, restorative urban design not only focuses on ecological aspects but also attempts to create a built environment that allows its users to thrive both physically and mentally. Regenerative urban design is more inclined to restore or create an "ability". Further, both disciplines are in their infancy but have evolved from internal conceptual development to the stage of exploring external relationships and frameworks as well as mechanisms. This review found that although many frameworks and models are used to support and evaluate these two disciplines, almost all of them fail to integrate necessary aspects of the ecosystem, e.g., elements, relationships, processes, etc. Moreover, future work should examine the design patterns that are closely related to restorative and regenerative urban design to better guide the concrete practice.

AB  - The rise of e-commerce has led to substantial changes in personal travel and activities. We systematically reviewed empirical studies on the relationship between online shopping and personal travel behaviour. We synthesised and assessed the evidence for four types of effects on various travel outcomes, including trip frequency, travel distance, trip chaining, mode choice, and time use. In 42 articles reviewed, we found more evidence that online shopping substitutes for shopping travel. Most studies to date have focused on trip frequency but neglected other travel outcomes. Very few studies have considered the modification effect, which has significant implications for travel demand management. In sum, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the dominant effect of online shopping, in part due to the diversity in variable measurements, types of goods, study areas, and analytic methods. A limitation of previous studies is the reliance on cross-sectional surveys, which hinders the distinction between short- and long-term behaviours and between modification, complementarity, and substitution effects. Our study provides an agenda for future research on this topic and discusses policy implications related to land use, behavioural changes, data collection, and modelling for practitioners who wish to incorporate e-commerce in planning for sustainable urban systems.

AB  - In this study, the impacts of small-scale farmers on food security enhancement were estimated in three dimensions of food availability, food access and food utilization. In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis have been performed to synthesize results from 75 original articles. It includes the pooling of data that quantitatively investigate whether or not causal links characterized in the original articles remain valid across a broader scope of the literature. The findings show that farmers who are small-scale in natural/physical capital would lead to higher median food production and agricultural productivity, compared with small-scale farmers in financial capital, at about 19% and 15%, respectively. Meta-regression results indicate that small-scale farmers in natural/physical capital have significantly positive effects on the average agricultural productivity, food income and biofortification. By contrast, farmers who are small-scale in financial capital have negative effects on food security. The influential role of these small-scale farmers should also be considered since food insecurity leads to socio-economic implications. Therefore, it is recommended to cultivate higher value crops, to participate in various income-generating activities such as fisheries and forestry, and to pay agricultural credits. The effect of the size of small-scale farmers on global food security is very useful for policymakers to plan for a world without hunger. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biodiversity inventories provide critical information on the ecology of natural ecosystems and inform conservation planning at local to regional scales. Based on a systematic review, we compiled data on over 1000 mammal inventories conducted throughout the Neotropics - from Mexico to Argentina - to document the status of assemblage-wide field mammalogy in the world's most biodiverse Tropical realm. We analysed data using descriptive statistics and a confusion matrix to understand the prevalence of species' pseudo-absences, map overall patterns of survey density, and quantify any geographic sampling bias. Based on the 1028 site-specific inventories published between 1983 and 2020, mean species richness of medium- to large-bodied mammals was 11.9 (+/- 8.8 standard deviation). Local inventories were distributed across elevational gradients, and overall sampling effort and survey techniques employed were extremely variable. The best-sampled regions were the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Mesoamerica, but we identified nine large assemblage-wide Wallacean shortfalls and a pseudo-absence rate of 11% (+/- 4% standard deviation); geographic sampling bias was largely related to human population density, regardless of the assemblages' intactness presumably found in the undersampled wilderness regions of the Neotropics. We document the 40-year legacy of mammal field surveys throughout the Neotropics, where several glaring knowledge shortfalls still persist. This calls for an audacious research agenda for future Neotropical mammal studies, which should target sampling in more remote areas, standardise sampling methodology, and provide high-resolution data that can be used to fill current knowledge shortfalls. To do so, Latin American countries and the wider international community will need to commit greater personnel and financial resources to understanding biodiversity patterns and processes related to the Tropical vertebrate fauna.

AB  - An estimated 17% of migratory bird species are threatened or near threatened with extinction. This represents an enormous potential loss of biodiversity and cost to human societies due to the economic benefits that birds provide through ecosystem services and ecotourism. Conservation of migratory bird species presents many unique challenges, as these birds rely on multiple geographically distinct habitats, including breeding grounds, non-breeding grounds, and stopover sites during migration. In particular, stopover habitats are seldom studied relative to breeding and non-breeding habitats, despite their importance as refueling stations for migratory birds. In this study, we summarize the current research on the use of temporary primary crops by birds during migration and we assess the species characteristics and agricultural practices most often associated with the use of cropland as stopover habitat. First, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the effects various farming practices and crop types have on the abundance and diversity of migratory birds using agricultural areas for stopovers. Second, we analyzed the ecological correlates of bird species in the Northern Hemisphere that predict which species may use these areas while migrating. We ran a GLMM to test whether primary diet, diet breadth, primary habitat, habitat breadth, or realm predicted stopover use of agricultural areas. Our review suggests that particular crop types (principally rice, corn, and sunflower), as well as farming practices that result in higher non-cultivated plant diversity, encourage the use of agricultural areas by migrating birds. We found that cropland is used as stopover habitat by bird species that can utilize a large breadth of habitats, as well as species with preferences for habitat similar in structure to agricultural areas.

AB  - Background
   Dengue is a prioritized public health concern in China. Because of the larger scale, more frequent and wider spatial distribution, the challenge for dengue prevention and control has increased in recent years. While land use and land cover (LULC) change was suggested to be associated with dengue, relevant research has been quite limited. The "Open Door" policy introduced in 1978 led to significant LULC change in China. This systematic review is the first to review the studies on the impacts of LULC change on dengue dynamics in China. This review aims at identifying the research evidence, research gaps and provide insights for future research.
   Methods
   A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol. The combinations of search terms on LULC, dengue and its vectors were searched in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Baidu Scholar. Research conducted on China published from 1978 to December 2019 and written in English or Chinese was selected for further screening. References listed in articles meeting the inclusion criteria were also reviewed and included if again inclusion criteria were met to minimize the probability of missing relevant research.
   Results
   28 studies published between 1978 and 2017 were included for the full review. Guangdong Province and southern Taiwan were the major regional foci in the literature. The majority of the reviewed studies observed associations between LULC change factors and dengue incidence and distribution. Conflictive evidence was shown in the studies about the impacts of green space and blue space on dengue in China. Transportation infrastructure and urbanization were repeatedly suggested to be positively associated with dengue incidence and spread. The majority of the studies reviewed considered meteorological and sociodemographic factors when they analyzed the effects of LULC change on dengue. Primary and secondary remote sensing (RS) data were the primary source for LULC variables. In 21 of 28 studies, a geographic information system (GIS) was used to process data of environmental variables and dengue cases and to perform spatial analysis of dengue.
   Conclusions
   The effects of LULC change on the dynamics of dengue in China varied in different periods and regions. The application of RS and GIS enriches the means and dimensions to explore the relations between LULC change and dengue. Further comprehensive regional research is necessary to assess the influence of LULC change on local dengue transmission to provide practical advice for dengue prevention and control.
   Author summary
   Dengue is a major public health concern in China. The rapid development of urbanization along with climate change increases the challenge for dengue prevention and control. Previous research has mainly focused on the meteorological variables whereas land use and land cover (LULC) change received comparatively less attention. Our review identified that the regional research hotspots of dengue epidemics in China were Guangdong Province and southern Taiwan. Though inconsistent, most included studies somehow observed associations between at least one of the LULC change factors and dengue. A geographical information system (GIS) was widely used to perform spatial analysis in the selected literature. Its application provided a novel view to describe the relationships between environmental factors and the situation of dengue, which enabled scholars to explore more characteristics of dengue transmission. Meanwhile, the use of remote sensing (RS) enriched the means of environmental monitoring. However, there are research gaps in the area of dengue and LULC change, such as the less consideration of dengue vector study, the lack of interplays between factors, and the lack of considering interventions and policies. Furthermore, because of different research settings, results from these studies were difficult to compare. Thus, further comprehensive and comparable investigations are necessary to better understand the effects of LULC change on dengue in China. This review is the first to expound the studies on the associations between LULC change and dengue dynamics in China. It demonstrates the findings and methodologies and provided insights for future research.

AB  - Background. Though many studies have long considered the broad social implications of climate change, researchers have only recently started to consider the gendered unevenness of the global landscape of vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity to environmental stressors and shocks. Historically, policies and interventions addressing natural resource-based livelihoods have rarely considered underlying gender dynamics despite the global pervasiveness of gendered disparities in both economic opportunities and welfare outcomes. Methods/Design. Using two electronic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature describing livelihoods policies or interventions that included documentation of gendered impacts. We focused on natural resource-based livelihoods most likely to be affected by climate change, centering on interventions targeting agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry. Review Results/Synthesis. We identified 131 relevant articles, most of which focus on adoption or participation in interventions rather than outcomes. In general, women are less likely than men to engage with sustainable livelihoods interventions. When women do engage, some researchers have documented income and food security gains as well as improvements in environmental indicators in the short-term. However, these initiatives have also been found to increase women's labor burden without corresponding gains in income. Few studies measure longer-term effects of women's engagement on welfare and environmental outcomes, a key gap in the literature. Additionally, relatively few studies explore the intersectional impacts of initiatives, such as the added burdens of ethnicity, class, education, or other differences that modify gender disparities. Discussion. Climate change has gendered impacts on natural resource-based livelihoods. In general, existing initiatives designed to increase livelihood resilience fail to reduce gender disparities and improve women's livelihoods. Greater attention should be paid to gender when designing sustainable livelihoods policies and interventions in order to increase adoption and participation, negotiate trade-offs, improve environmental conditions, and promote broadly beneficial welfare outcomes.

AB  - Historical and archival sources are of cardinal importance in landscape research addressing the processes and course of landscape changes in European regions. The Franziscean cadastre from the 19th century is among the most widely used historical sources in Central Europe. We identified 1440 records, finally providing 104 articles reporting the use of the Franziscean cadastre for in-depth analyses in order to identify (i) the practice of the cadastral data processing, (ii) purpose and spatial extent of the study, (iii) use of complementary sources and (iv) particular land use/land cover classes under study. We have found the increasing attention towards the Franziscean cadastre as a source for landscape research reflected by the doubling number of records in the past decade with majority of the case studies located in Czechia (79), followed by Austria (9) and Italy (3). We have identified the trends in the use in landscape trajectory research and application to hydrology, agriculture and forestry. As regards the data processing, several issues connected with the methodology or design of the records were found (e.g. geographic information system processing description and data source specification). We further problematize the suitability of the supplementary data used and conclude our review with a set of recommendations to contribute to the discussion on the methodology of landscape reconstruction with historical datasets.

AB  - The paper follows on results of the survey that was conducted in an area of individual and legal entities operating in the Czech Republic's market and pointed to the increasing demands of stakeholders on environment protection and social responsibility. The current situation in a business management calls for the need of a uniform approach integrating social and environmental concerns into an existing business management. Application of the "triple bottom line concept" is a response to this need. One of the possible and at the same time effective ways is its integration into the Balanced Scorecard Concept, whose logical connection with financial and non-financial perspectives enables to share sustainable business strategy at different levels of the company. This paper develops Balanced Scorecard for Sustainability Management that is crucial for measurement and evaluation of day-to-day social and environmental operations from following four perspectives: finance, customer, internal business process and learning and growth. Balanced Scorecard has been developed further based on comprehensive analysis and extensive review of literature on Sustainability Concept into a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard and there is proposed a methodology that will enable the implementation of the sustainability principles into corporate strategy through the Balanced Scorecard. The Balanced Scorecard developed in this paper provides a useful guidance for the practical managers in evaluation and measuring of Sustainability in a balanced way and proposes a balanced performance measurement system. This means that this paper offers not only a systematic review, which is crucial for advancing an academic field, but should be also used to inform and to enhance management practice. The theoretical part is supplemented by a case study. In terms of research methodology the paper is based on the results of the survey, the literature search and the analysis of documents dealing with the issue, along with modelling and analogy. The paper was created on the basis of a project SGS- 2013-040 Paradigm of development in the 21st century and its impact on the behaviour of economic entities.

AB  - The study examines the nexus between `regionalism cum regional integration' and health. Health issues, especially in the time of emergencies, pose some challenges for regional integration efforts and could, in some cases, lead to the stagnation of a regional project. On the other hand, health is a viable platform on which regionalism can thrive and be strengthened. More so, regional initiatives for health promotion and management can also help in improving the health of the people of a region or in some adverse cases exacerbate health issues. The relationship between the two concepts is never unidirectional. This article is premised on the proposition that `health is development' and regionalism is essentially for development too. Consequently, there is a point of convergence. Lessons are drawn here from different regions on how regionalism and health can interact for the attainment of sustainable health goals. The study involves a historical, descriptive and prescriptive analysis of the phenomena. A systematic review of existing literature in PubMed and Web of Science databases is done to indicate the links between the concepts with relevant cases; to identify the opportunities and the challenges of the interaction between the two concepts. The theoretical underpinnings of `relationships' is also examined. Regionalism offers states an opportunity to pool resources for the attainment of the highest standard of health for the region. The paper, therefore, recommends more health' consciousnesses in macro-regional planning and policy. Health can aid regionalism, and the latter has much utility in the attempt to govern and respond to health issues.

AB  - BackgroundPrimary health care and its strengthening through performance measurement is essential for sustainably working towards universal health coverage. Existing performance frameworks and indicators to measure primary health care capture system functions like governance, financing and resourcing but to a lesser extent the function of services delivery and its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, most frameworks have weak links with routine information systems and national health priorities, especially in the context of high- and middle-income countries. This paper presents the development of a tool that responds to this context with the aim to create primary health care performance intelligence for the 53 countries of the WHO European Region.MethodsThe work builds-off of an existing systematic review on primary care and draws on priorities of current European health policies and available (inter)national information systems. Its development included: (i) reviewing and classifying features of primary care; (ii) constructing a set of tracer conditions; and (iii) mapping existing indicators in the framework resulting from (i). The analysis was validated through a series of reviews: in-person meetings with country-nominated focal points and primary care experts; at-distance expert reviews; and, preliminary testing with country informants.ResultsThe resulting framework applies a performance continuum in the classical approach of structures-processes-outcomes spanning 6 domains - primary care structures, model of primary care, care contact, primary care outputs, health system outcomes, and health outcomes - that are further classified by 26 subdomains and 63 features of primary care. A care continuum was developed using a set of 12 tracer conditions. A total of 139 indicators were mapped to the classification, each with an identified data source to safeguard measurability. Individual indicator passports and a glossary of terms were developed to support the standardization of the findings.ConclusionThe resulting framework and suite of indicators, coined the Primary Health Care Impact, Performance and Capacity Tool (PHC-IMPACT), has the potential to be applied in Europe, closing the gap on existing data collection, analysis and use of performance intelligence for decision-making towards primary health care strengthening.

AB  - In the context of strong evidence on mounting climate-related risks and impacts across the globe, the need for 'transformational change' in climate risk management and adaptation responses has been brought forward as an important element to achieve the Paris ambitions. In the past decade, the concept has experienced increasing popularity in policy debates and academic discussions but has seen heterogeneous applications and little practical insight. The paper aims to identify relevant perspectives on transformative approaches and transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation to propose an actionable definition for practical application. Using a systematic search and review approach, we review different perspectives across policy and scientific publications, focusing on work published in the past decade and identify common features of what transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation may involve. We show that different perspectives on transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation persist, but certain areas of convergence are discernible. This includes understanding transformational change as part of a spectrum that begins with incremental change; involves climate risk management and adaptation measures focusing on deep-rooted, system-level change and tends to aim at enabling more just and sustainable futures; often oriented towards the long-term, in anticipation of future climate-related developments. In addition, we identify an 'operationalisation gap' in terms of translating transformational change ambitions into concrete transformative measures that can be replicated in practice.

AB  - Biodiversity is being affected by the overexploitation of natural resources, the increase of invasive species, climate change, intensive agriculture, and livestock farming. Among these, intensive soybean cultivation has displaced other products such as rice and wheat; intensive cultivation leads to increased use of agrochemicals, which generates severe socio-environmental effects, particularly on biodiversity. The objective of the study was to compile scientific literature produced on the loss of biodiversity caused by intensive agriculture and climate change, and within them the possible effects on the interrelationship between human beings and the environment. The methodological procedure was the systematic review developed in March 2021, using Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT with terms "biodiversity", "climate change" and "agriculture" in the Scopus, Web of Science and Scielo databases. The results identified that there were at least 99 topics in Web of Science (99 topics), Scopus (155 topics) and Scielo (36 topics) that show the loss of biodiversity due to climate change and the expansion of intensive agriculture with consequences, not only in the regions surrounding the crops in question, but also indirectly in the mountain regions through the consumption of soybean in animals and derivatives in humans. It is concluded that biodiversity as a provider of food and disease prevention for humanity contributes to sustainability and, therefore, its preservation requires the adoption of aggressive public policies within the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB  - Protection and sustainable management of water was indicated as one of the strategic tasks in the process of transformation towards a circular economy (CE) in the European Union (EU), therefore, the water and wastewater sector plays an important role in this process. At the same time, the European Commission (EC) strongly underlined the importance of the possibility to assess the transformation process toward the CE, and developed a set of CE indicators that are available on the Eurostat website. However, these indicators have limited ability to assess the transformation progress in the water and wastewater sector. This paper presents a set of indicators for assessing the economic progress of transformation towards the CE in this sector. The proposed economic CE indicators were grouped into the following actions of the CE model in the water and wastewater sector: reduction, reclamation (removal), reuse, recycling, recovery and landfilling. The selection of specific indicators was based on a systematic review of the literature presenting economic indicators developed by international organisations and researchers (covering different thematic areas, scopes and potential applications). The selected economic CE indicators were assigned to three groups of the cash flow: income (revenues, expenses), costs, and investment financing. The proposed CE indicators can be used by water supply and sewage companies (i.e., supplying water to the public and wastewater treatment plants, and companies that use water in their production processes) to assess the level of the transformation toward the CE at a microeconomic level. An important aspect of future application and usage of the proposed set of CE economic indicators is the collection and processing of data needed for their reporting. The proposed set of CE economic indicators refers to information that are reported by the companies to prove its revenues, costs and investment outlays, and are collected by companies anyway. The proposed set of economic CE indicators is flexible, allowing the adaptation of indicators and areas of interest to maintain effectiveness throughout the transition period from linear to the CE model.

AB  - Qualitative content analysis as a kind of systematic analysis of qualitative data in which the latent values and meanings of the text are tried to be identified, described, and interpreted, is one of the most widely used qualitative methods in urban planning research and urban studies. However, the excessive flexibility and development of the method in other theoretical fields have obscured how to use it in the field of planning and urban studies. In this paper, we have tried to propose a procedural model that is suitable for the specific con-ditions and issues of the field by analyzing the content of the documents obtained from the systematic review of the theoretical literature of planning and urban studies that have used this method. This procedural model ex-plains the process of qualitative content analysis within five stages: choosing the type and theoretical context of data, explaining the objectives, deciding on how to analyze the data, deciding on how to interpret the data, and application of the interpretation results. Proposing the procedural model of qualitative content analysis that comes from the field of planning and urban studies can help, in addition to disambiguating the function of the method, make the method more visible and more correctly used in the field.

AB  - It is likely that adolescents who have difficulties in coping with internalized or externalized problems seek psychotherapy. Psychodrama, which provides individuals with the opportunity of staging problems instead of talking about them, is a very suitable psychotherapy option for adolescents. The present study aimed to conduct a systematic review that would meticulously summarize the empirical evidence presented in earlier studies on the effectiveness of psychodrama in solving internalizing/externalizing problems of adolescents. Peer-reviewed studies conducted on psychodrama interventions for adolescents, published in English between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2021, indexed in five databases (EBSCOHOST, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct) were searched. After the review, it was concluded that 7 empirical studies met the inclusion criteria. The characteristics and methodological features of these studies were reviewed, the efficiency of psy-chodrama was evaluated and the problem areas of focus were determined. Four studies were conducted in Turkey, one in Israel, one in Palestine, and one in Iran. The effectiveness of psychodrama was tested on 11-17 years, old adolescents. It was seen that the Experimental/Quasi-Experimental Design was used in the included studies, in-group/intergroup effects were compared, and psychodrama interventions varied between 9 and 22 sessions, the effect size was clearly expressed in some of them and was not stated in most of them. It was found that the risk in terms of selection, performance, and attrition bias was unclear or low in these studies. The studies mostly investigated the effects of psychodrama on aggression, and the findings demonstrated that the method was effective on internalized behavior such as loneliness, introversion, anxiety, depression, commitment, con-fidence, self-disclosure, loyalty, self-awareness, tension, suicidal ideation, and externalized behavior such as smoking, alcohol and substance use, leaving home, risky sexual intercourse, and conflict resolution skills. It is considered that the results of this study will increase the awareness that psychodrama is functional in the intervention of adolescents' internal and external problems. Suggestions for improvement in future studies that will uncover the effectiveness of psychodrama are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of involving sustainability in the Human Resources (HR) area, which is still a major challenge to be faced, will only occur when the leadership shares the values that influence ethics at work and have a more involved relationship with all business stakeholders.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to verify the relationship between the dimensions of Spiritual Leadership, the functional and competitive dimensions of Human Resources and Organizational Sustainability.
   METHODS: Through the Systematic Review Method, the available literature has been categorized based on the thematic alignment of the topics. Content analysis of 49 articles included predetermined codes verifying the most recurrent dimensions of each thematic axis.
   RESULTS: Among theHRfunctional dimensions, the one represented by training and development, assumes an intermediate role between the achievement of the intended cultural management, which can be through communication and teamwork, until reaching the organizational sustainability actions, which is the main purpose of this thematic relationship.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article makes a unique contribution to the existing literature on spiritual leadership and sustainable human resources management as well as reveals new avenues of in-depth research focusing specifically on the relationship of the thematic axes uncovered in the study.

TI  - Features of effective primary health care models in rural and remote Australia: a case-study analysis
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: To describe the factors and processes that facilitate or inhibit implementation, sustainability and generalisation of effective models of primary health care (PHC) service delivery in rural and remote Australia.
   Design: Case-study approach, including review of relevant literature, interviews with key informants, site visits and direct observation. Thematic analysis and template analysis were used with interview transcripts. An expert reference group provided feedback and advice on policy relevance.
   Setting and participants: Six PHC services in small communities across rural and remote Australia were selected based on results of a previous systematic review; they reflected diverse rural and remote settings and PHC models, and the multidisciplinary nature of PHC. Sites were visited, and 55 individuals associated with the establishment and operation of these services were interviewed between July 2006 and December 2007.
   Results: Independent and template analysis confirmed the usefulness of a conceptual framework, which identified three key "environmental enablers" - supportive policy; federal and state/territory relations; and community readiness - and five essential service requirements - governance, management and leadership; funding; linkages; infrastructure; and workforce supply. Systematically addressing each of these factors improves effectiveness and lessens the threat to service sustainability.
   Conclusions: Evidence from existing effective rural and remote PHC services can inform the health care reform agenda, in Australia and other countries. The evidence highlights the need for improved governance, management and community involvement, as well as strong, visionary political leadership to achieve a more responsive and better coordinated health system which could help eliminate existing health status differentials between cities and rural areas. In Australia, establishment of a single national health system, operationalised at a regional level, would obviate much of the current inefficiency and poor coordination. MJA 2009; 191: 88-91

AB  - Global food production, food supply chains and food security are increasingly stressed by human population growth and loss of arable land, becoming more vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. Numerous mutualistic and antagonistic species are interconnected with the cultivation of crops and livestock and these can be challenging to identify on the large scales of food production systems. Accurate identifications to capture this diversity and rapid scalable monitoring are necessary to identify emerging threats (i.e. pests and pathogens), inform on ecosystem health (i.e. soil and pollinator diversity), and provide evidence for new management practices (i.e. fertiliser and pesticide applications). Increasingly, environmental DNA (eDNA) is providing rapid and accurate classifications for specific organisms and entire species assemblages in substrates ranging from soil to air. Here, we aim to discuss how eDNA is being used for monitoring of agricultural ecosystems, what current limitations exist, and how these could be managed to expand applications into the future. In a systematic review we identify that eDNA-based monitoring in food production systems accounts for only 4 % of all eDNA studies. We found that the majority of these eDNA studies target soil and plant substrates (60 %), predominantly to identify microbes and insects (60 %) and are biased towards Europe (42 %). While eDNA-based monitoring studies are uncommon in many of the world's food production systems, the trend is most pronounced in emerging economies often where food security is most at risk. We suggest that the biggest limitations to eDNA for agriculture are false negatives resulting from DNA degradation and assay biases, as well as incomplete databases and the interpretation of abundance data. These require in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to carefully design, test and apply eDNA monitoring for reliable and accurate taxonomic identifications. We explore future opportunities for eDNA research which could further develop this useful tool for food production system monitoring in both emerging and developed economics, hopefully improving monitoring, and ultimately food security.

AB  - Investment in biofuels, as sustainable alternatives for fossil fuels, has gained momentum over the last decade due to the global environmental and health concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Hence, effective management of biofuel supply chain (BSC) components, including biomass feedstock production, biomass logistics, biofuel production in biorefineries, and biofuel distribution to consumers, is crucial in transitioning towards a lowcarbon and circular economy (CE). The present study aims to render an inclusive knowledge map of the BSCrelated scientific production. In this vein, a systematic review, supported by a keywords co-occurrence analysis and qualitative content analysis, was carried out on a total of 1,975 peer-reviewed journal articles in the target literature. The analysis revealed four major research hotspots in the BSC literature, namely (1) biomass-tobiofuel supply chain design and planning, (2) environmental impacts of biofuel production, (3) biomass to bioenergy, and (4) techno-economic analysis of biofuel production. Besides, the findings showed that the following subject areas of research in the BSC research community have recently attracted more attention: (i) global warming and climate change mitigation, (ii) development of the third-generation biofuels produced from algal biomass, which has recently gained momentum in the CE debate, and (iii) government incentives, pricing, and subsidizing policies. The provided insights shed light on the understanding of researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers involved in the sustainable energy sector by outlining the main research backgrounds, developments, and tendencies within the BSC arena. Looking at the provided knowledge map, potential research directions in BSCs towards implementing the CE model, including (i) integrative policy convergence at macro, meso, and micro levels, and (ii) industrializing algae-based biofuel production towards the CE transition, were proposed.

AB  - At the dawn of a new European Green Deal (EGD), it is necessary to reconsider the plans and actions that have characterized the European energy policies during recent decades by tuning and updating the priorities and targets. The present work moves from the systematic review of the documents, laws, and scientific studies concerning energy and climate initiatives to the analysis of the role of the Strategic Energy and Technology Plan (SET Plan) in the energy transition. Thus, the principal research question addresses the influence of the SET Plan on multi-level energy policies. To answer this, firstly, the juridical framework in which the SET Plan was instituted is provided; secondly, its correlation to the upcoming EDG is described and the targets identified by each Implementation Working Group (IWG) are discussed. Such a dissertation is followed by the investigation of the activities at various levels from the IWG on Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy. The study has confirmed that the SET Plan contributed to shaping the energy and climate policy at European, national, and regional levels by implementing synergies among different levels of governance, different sectors, and various stakeholders (both public and private). Furthermore, it eased the sharing of data on flagship projects by periodically monitoring the achieved results.

AB  - First developed in Earth system science, the idea of planetary boundaries has gradually spilled over into social science research in the past decade. An interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged as a result at the intersection of Earth system science, law and governance. In this article, we provide a bird's eye view of the state of the art, and examine how social scientists frame the planetary boundaries framework and what they identify as key regulatory challenges and implications. To that end, we conducted a systematic review of 80 peer-reviewed articles identified through a keyword search. Our survey finds that social scientists have approached the planetary boundaries framework using four key problem framings, which revolve around the notion of planetary boundaries as embodying a set of interdependent and politically constructed environmental limits that are global in scale. We also identify four key clusters of governance solutions offered in the literature, which broadly relate to the ideas of institutionalizing, coordinating, downscaling and democratizing planetary boundaries. We then apply the foregoing insights to the legal domain and explore their implications for law. More specifically, we discuss how the recently proposed notion of Earth system law is related to these emerging problem framings and how it might contribute to these responses.

AB  - The purpose of this review was to evaluate systematically all published and unpublished research concerning culture and medical procedural pain in children. Databases, reference lists, and electronic list servers were searched as data sources. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (80%) were conducted solely in the United States comparing Caucasian American groups to other local subculture(s) (ie, African American, Hispanic, or Japanese). The studies compared, cross culturally, pediatric pain-related outcomes in children, parents and/or health professionals. The medical procedural experiences included surgery, immunization, spinal tap, bone marrow aspiration, needle procedures, orthopedic, and wound-related injuries. The evidence published to date suggests that cultural factors may be associated with children's pain experiences when elicited by medical procedural pain, specifically children's pain behavior. Nevertheless, research using more sophisticated research methods is needed to develop culturally sensitive behavioral pain measures. Measures that include physiological pain parameters in addition to other behavioral outcomes may be helpful. Culturally comparative research would benefit from the use of theoretical frameworks to advance our understanding of the cultural underpinnings of child pain development and guide future research.
   Perspective: The current evidence supports that children and parents belonging to cultural minority groups, and in need of health care, are a vulnerable population. Together, researchers and clinicians are encouraged to explore this understudied area, and take advantage of sophisticated methods developed by disciplines like cross-cultural psychology.

AB  - Background "Carbon footprint" (CF) is a direct measure of greenhouse gas emissions caused by a defined activity and can demonstrate global warming effects. The emissions of Greenhouse gases (GHGs) in water projects start from the primary water sources, followed by transportation, construction, and operation phases in the final treatment plants. Due to their possible environmental impacts, the water treatment plants equipped with Reverse Osmosis (RO) units will be investigated for their carbon footprint.Methods The research question is "What is the carbon footprint of reverse osmosis in water treatment plants?". The literature search in this study will be divided into two sequential sections; in the first section, the search will be limited to Scopus, Science Direct, EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The keywords of water, "water treatment plants", "water purification", desalination, "reverse osmosis", RO, "carbon emission", "carbon dioxide/CO2 emission", "carbon footprint", "Life Cycle Assessment" and, LCA will be used. The carbon footprint of RO will be expressed based on the direct and indirect effects based on RO capacity. In the second section, the internet and specialist search will be done, and the search will be updated. No date limitation will be considered, and the main search will be done in English. When the search is completed, the screening will be performed. After removing duplicates, the title and abstract will be examined. The full text will be read if the title and abstract are not helpful for decision-making. In addition, the bibliography and references will proceed after the full-text screening. The Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Critical Appraisal Tool will be used for risk of bias checking and study validity assessment. After full-text evaluation, data will be collected and categorized by two authors. If there is enough data, meta-analysis will be performed.

AB  - With the synchronous development of highway construction and the urban economy, automobiles have entered thousands of households as essential means of transportation. This paper reviews the latest research progress in using phytoremediation technology to remediate the environmental pollution caused by automobile exhaust in recent years, including the prospects for stereoscopic forestry. Currently, most automobiles on the global market are internal combustion vehicles using fossil energy sources as the primary fuel, such as gasoline, diesel, and liquid or compressed natural gas. The composition of vehicle exhaust is relatively complex. When it enters the atmosphere, it is prone to a series of chemical reactions to generate various secondary pollutants, which are very harmful to human beings, plants, animals, and the eco-environment. Despite improving the automobile fuel quality and installing exhaust gas purification devices, helping to reduce air pollution, the treatment costs of these approaches are expensive and cannot achieve zero emissions of automobile exhaust pollutants. The purification of vehicle exhaust by plants is a crucial way to remediate the environmental pollution caused by automobile exhaust and improve the environment along the highway by utilizing the ecosystem's self-regulating ability. Therefore, it has become a global trend to use phytoremediation technology to restore the automobile exhaust pollution. Now, there is no scientific report or systematic review about how plants absorb vehicle pollutants. The screening and configuration of suitable plant species is the most crucial aspect of successful phytoremediation. The mechanisms of plant adsorption, metabolism, and detoxification are reviewed in this paper to address the problem of automobile exhaust pollution.

AB  - Ship-infrastructure cooperation, i.e., infrastructure scheduling, is significant for optimizing the utilization of spatial-temporal resources of infrastructures and improving the efficiency and safety of waterborne transportation systems. This paper carries out a systematic review of the scheduling problems of the infrastructures in waterborne transportation systems, including locks, terminals, berths, and waterway intersections. The infrastructure scheduling problems are linked to the classical optimization problems, and a generalized infrastructure scheduling problem is formulated. For lock scheduling, the ship placement sub-problem aims at minimizing the number of lockages, which is a kind of classic 2D bin packing problem; the lockage scheduling sub-problem deals with chamber assignment and lockage operation planning, which is modeled as a single or parallel machine scheduling problem. For berth and terminal scheduling, the idea of queuing theory (for discrete terminal) and 2D bin packing (for continuous terminal) are usually applied. Most research aims at minimizing the waiting time of ships and focuses on the continuous dynamic terminal scheduling problems. As a special infrastructure, the waterway intersection receives little attention. Most research focuses on traffic conflicts and capacity problems. Future research directions are provided based on the review results and problems of infrastructure scheduling in practice.

AB  - Intentional moving of species threatened by climate change is actively being discussed as a conservation approach. The debate, empirical studies, and policy development, however, are impeded by an inconsistent articulation of the idea. The discrepancy is demonstrated by the varying use of terms, such as assisted migration, assisted colonisation, or managed relocation, and their multiple definitions. Since this conservation approach is novel, and may for instance lead to legislative changes, it is important to aim for terminological consistency. The objective of this study is to analyse the suitability of terms and definitions used when discussing the moving of organisms as a response to climate change. An extensive literature search and review of the material (868 scientific publications) was conducted for finding hitherto used terms (N = 40) and definitions (N = 75), and these were analysed for their suitability. Based on the findings, it is argued that an appropriate term for a conservation approach relating to aiding the movement of organisms harmed by climate change is assisted migration defined as follows: Assisted migration means safeguarding biological diversity through the translocation of representatives of a species or population harmed by climate change to an area outside the indigenous range of that unit where it would be predicted to move as climate changes, were it not for anthropogenic dispersal barriers or lack of time. The differences between assisted migration and other conservation translocations are also discussed. A wide adoption of the clear and distinctive term and definition provided would allow more focused research on the topic and enable consistent implementation as practitioners could have the same understanding of the concept.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this systematic literature review is to contribute to the knowledge about barriers to change in urban freight systems and to support managed changes toward more sustainable urban freight systems. Method This paper is based on a systematic review covering 93 peer-reviewed journal articles. The study was designed to advance earlier research in this area by providing a system perspective on barriers to development in urban freight systems. The theoretical knowledge about these barriers was analyzed and synthesized, the relationships between barriers explored, and the insights developed into a model of understanding of managed change processes in urban freight systems. Findings From a system perspective 11 categories of barriers to change in urban freight systems were identified and characterized. The barriers are, in different ways, related both to each other and to a managed change process for sustainable development of urban freight systems. A model for understanding categories of barriers and their connection to managed change processes in urban freight systems is proposed in this paper. The model consists of three groups of barriers within the process, and two groups in the system context, which should be addressed with different priorities in a managed change process. The study identifies several future research options. Future research could support the development of sustainable urban freight systems by providing insights into change process governance, potentially by combining theory from areas like organization, systems, and networks with the system perspective on urban freight systems. Research on non-European urban freight systems could increase the scholarly insights about contextual impact on barriers and change processes. Future studies could also explore methods to mitigate identified barriers, especially in the areas of cooperation, organization, politics, knowledge, and the first mover disadvantage. Finally, future research should continue to develop the model of the managed change process for urban freight systems and its use in supporting sustainable development of these systems.

AB  - Aim The evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early intervention for psychosis (EIP) services has motivated their implementation worldwide. However, complex interventions of such EIP services require local adaptations to successfully match population needs and cultural differences. Latin America is a heterogenous region where EIP services are progressively being adopted. Our aim is to map such initiatives in the region with a focus on implementation outcomes. Methods A scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines was conducted. International and regional databases were searched for publications describing EIP programmes in the region. Besides mapping the services, we described implementation outcomes based on the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies Checklist. Results Ten articles describing seven EIP initiatives from the region were found. Four countries were represented: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. The implementation outcomes reporting was heterogenous, although it was possible to ascertain EIP services are feasible and adequate for the region's context. Also, there is some evidence of effectiveness in terms of reducing hospitalizations and improving symptoms. Information about fidelity measures was scarce and there was no information about costs or cost-effectiveness. Conclusions Only a small proportion of Latin American countries have adopted EIP services. Although these programmes seem to be feasible and effective, data on other implementation outcomes, such as fidelity, cultural appropriateness, cost-effectiveness and affordability are not available. This might in part explain why this effective approach has not been yet scaled-up at nationwide levels.

AB  - Ecological infrastructure (EI) is a natural and near-natural functioning ecosystem that delivers a range of essential services to humankind. Examples include mountain catchments, wetlands, coastal dunes, and riparian corridors. In a world where EI is underinvested, rapid degradation and threats such as unsustainable veld-fire regimes, droughts, climate change, and invasive alien plants persist in dominating the ecological landscape. In South Africa, there are government programmes that encourage the restoration, rehabilitation and protection of EI. However, inadequate funding allocations constrain scalingup and thus necessitate the unlocking of public and private sector investments to augment resources for ecosystem-based management interventions. A systematic literature review was conducted at a global scale to (1) understand the drivers behind EI investments, (2) understand the willingness and desire of private landowners and land users to participate and contribute to EI investments and (3) identify institutional support mechanisms used to encourage investments. Results suggest that the need to invest is driven by growing degradation of EI and the urgency to meet environmental sustainability goals. The willingness to invest is stimulated by the use of economic-based policies and compensatory mechanisms. Public-private partnerships, public policy, and market-based conservation instruments are institutional arrangements executed to protect EI. These include processes and systems used by the institutions to legislate and manage interventions towards fulfilling the conservation objective. Our review contributes to the EI investment research agenda by recommending coordinated efforts to encourage EI investment from both public and private partners. These measures will help to secure financial resources and mobilise investments beyond monetary terms by coordinating planning and developing capacity and reform policies.
   Significance:
   Reviewing international experiences on ecological infrastructure investments will help to inform the Natural Resources Management programmes' efforts to upscale the investments essential to conserve natural ecosystems. The lessons from the systematic review will further reveal other related natural ecosystem investment processes from which to learn. Therefore, gaining a global understanding of these lessons provides evidence-based advice for policy development and decision-making processes which seek to protect natural ecosystems for present and future generations.

AB  - Biodiversity of tropical grasslands and savannas (tropical grassy biomes, TGBs) remains poorly documented compared with tropical forests. This is in part due to the misplaced notion of TGBs being anthropogenic forest derivatives that support negligible biodiversity and endemism. For the Indian savannas, the legacy of colonial forestry has led to their misinterpretation as anthropogenic wastelands of low conservation value. One key assumption underlying the devaluation of Indian savannas against Indian forests is the presumed absence of endemic species. Through a systematic review, we test this assumption by collating data of plants endemic to the peninsular Indian savannas and analyze their spatiotemporal discovery patterns. We found that the Indian savannas contain 206 endemic plant species, of which 43% were described in the last two decades. Spatial discovery patterns revealed two species discovery hot spots, the eastern edge of the Western Ghats Mountains and the Eastern Ghats Mountains. Years taken for an endemic plant species to be described was related positively to latitude and elevation of the type locality, and negatively to range size and plant height. Our results of an exponential rise in the endemic plant discovery run counter to the assumption of Indian savannas supporting no endemic plants. Our findings have important implications on future plant discoveries by predicting most endemics awaiting discovery are likely to be short-statured and range-restricted, and occupy higher latitudes and elevations. The presence of endemic plants calls for abandoning the outdated colonial-era view of Indian savannas being low conservation value ecosystems and revising conservation policies to better protect these ancient ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction: The advent of climate change has raised new challenges for cities and made it necessary to adopt strategic policies for mitigating its impact and allowing them to adapt more effectively to extreme events.Objectives: To establish the concept of urban vulnerability and examine the measures adopted by towns and cities for the reduction of hydro-meteorological risks and their adaptation to climate change.Methodology: A systematic review of the literature was carried out which can be found in the Science Direct e Scielo database for the period 2011-2021 and this makes it possible to trace the evolutionary path of the concept of "urban vulnerability". Uniqueness/Significance: Urban vulnerability has become a key factor in the current assessment of climate change and studies in this area must be strengthened. As well as this, there is a need to determine the links between attempts to adapt to climate change and the measures available to find solutions for disaster risk reduction (DRR).Results: An evolutionary trend for the term "urban vulnerability" was noted, and this has been applied in several articles as a key variable in establishing an equation for disaster risk reduction. In 2020 there was evidence of progress that had been made in studies related to urban vulnerability regarding adaptations to climate change, new ideas about risk assessment and methods that could be employed at the local level (for towns and cities).Social contributions on the part of the management: At present, when faced with climate change, the DRR has become an emergency service which is aimed at protecting human lives and material goods. This is because, while expanding, many of our towns and cities have incorporated areas that are vulnerable to extreme events; this has led to an understanding of how essential urban planning is to mitigate the possible risks of hydro-meteorological disasters.

AB  - BackgroundMedical student and resident participation in short-term international trips for trainees (STINTTs) has increased in the past few decades. However, there has been no systematic review of trainees' actual ethical experiences. The authors sought to identify what ethical issues medical trainees encounter during STINTTs, as elicited by and reported in peer-reviewed, quantitative and qualitative research papers.MethodsThe authors systematically searched five academic databases finding 659 unique titles and abstracts. The authors applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to these titles and abstracts resulting in fourteen papers, which were analyzed using qualitative thematic synthesis.ResultsThe qualitative analysis of the papers generated four themes: (1) Trainees' Concerns Over Perpetuating Medical Tourism; (2) Struggling to Identify and Balance the Benefits and Harms of STINTTs; (3) The Complicated Trainee Mens (mind); and (4) Ethical Situations Encountered by Trainees. The fourth theme, which was the largest, was further divided into (a) Navigating social and cultural dynamics, (b) Trainees' experiences related to the learner role, and (c) Ethical situations not qualifying for other catagories. Some of these issues reported in the empirical research papers are well represented in the broader literature on STINTTs, while others were less sosuch as mistreatment of trainees. All included papers were published after 2010, and comprised a total of less than 170 medical trainees.ConclusionsMedical trainees report experiencing a wide range of ethical challenges during short-term international trips in which they engage in clinical or research activities. The authors call educators' attention to specific challenges that trainees face. The relevant literature covering US and Canadian STINTTs is relatively young and largely qualitative. The authors briefly sketch a program for expanding the research on this increasingly common educational experience.

AB  - Computer-based simulation (CBS) is an interactive pedagogical training method that has seen increased interest, especially in recent years. There is some evidence that CBS in pharmacy education is not as widely adopted compared to other healthcare disciplines. Pharmacy education literature to date has not specifically discussed the potential barriers which may cause this uptake challenge. In this systematic narrative review, we attempted to explore and discuss potential barriers that may impact the integration of CBS in pharmacy practice education and provide our suggestions to overcome them. We searched five major databases and used the AACODS checklist for grey literature assessment. We identified 42 studies and four grey literature reports, published between 1 January 2000 and 31 August 2022, which met the inclusion criteria. Then, the specific approach of Braun and Clarke for thematic analysis was followed. The majority of the included articles were from Europe, North America, and Australasia. Although none of the included articles had a specific focus on barriers to implementation, thematic analysis was used to extract and discuss several potential barriers, such as resistance to change, cost, time, usability of software, meeting accreditation standards, motivating and engaging students, faculty experience, and curriculum constraints. Ad- dressing academic, process, and cultural barriers can be considered the first step in providing guidance for future implementation research for CBS in pharmacy education. The analysis suggests that to effectively overcome any possible barriers to implementing CBS, different stakeholders must engage in careful planning, collaboration, and investment in resources and training. The review indicates that additional research is required to offer evidence-based approach and strategies to prevent overwhelming or disengaging users from either learning or teaching process. It also guides further research into exploring potential barriers in different institutional cultures and regions.

AB  - Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) is invasive in temperate freshwater wetlands throughout the United States and Canada and presents challenges to restoring tidal freshwater wetlands. Methods for the prevention or elimination of reed canarygrass in palustrine wetlands are generally well established, typically involving herbicide application, mechanical treatments, prolonged inundation, or establishment of competitive plant species. These methods are often not suitable for the unique conditions in tidal wetlands and alternative strategies remain poorly understood. Prolonging inundation of tidal wetlands requires a loss of habitat forming processes, connectivity, and other functions. Treatments such as mowing, discing, or fire are not feasible in the perpetually wet conditions of tidal wetlands. Restoration practitioners aiming to design self-sustaining wetlands in the lower Columbia River estuary and the U.S. Pacific Coast have found that reed canarygrass is widespread and quick to establish post-restoration creating a management burden and impacting restoration goals. Here we report the results of a comprehensive effort to develop methods for control in tidal wetlands through systematic review of the scientific literature, interviews with experienced practitioners, and field observations at nine Pacific Northwest sites. The review framework evaluated key environmental conditions affecting reed canarygrass, control methods, and practical considerations. Findings support an integrated long-term control strategy at the largest possible scale to establish effective and self-sustaining control. Appropriate and practical strategies for tidal freshwater wetlands include implementing control pre-restoration to suppress existing populations; topographic modification such as scrape-downs and mounds to support competitiveness of desired vegetation communities; seeding or planting strong native competitors; limiting nutrient availability; and periodic, targeted control to limit reinvasion. These strategies are supported by the study, but long-term results are generally not available. Formal field experiments are recommended by the authors to better evaluate factors that influence reed canarygrass control in tidal freshwater wetlands.

AB  - Tourism and natural resources are rapidly changing in the Arctic. Human activities and climate change are transforming natural landscapes and affecting populations of wildlife, while remote Arctic destinations that were previously regarded as inaccessible and unattractive are being engulfed by the global increase in tourism. In parallel with these developments, the concept and practice of "sustainable tourism" is gaining weight. Connecting these two trends raises multiple questions, including how tourism affects natural resources in the Arctic and whether sustainable Arctic tourism is possible. We conduct a systematic review of scientific publications connecting tourism and natural resources in the Arctic in order to shed light on the environmental dimensions of sustainable tourism. Based on our review, we highlight the multidirectional relationship between tourism and natural resources, and we use southern Greenland as a concrete example of an Arctic destination to which we tie our discussion of "sustainable tourism" in both theory and practice. We conclude that framing sustainable tourism as a relative and comparative concept specific to the time, place and type of tourism activity, rather than as a set of general and ideal criteria, might be more applicable and meaningful in research and as a development strategy for tourism destinations.

Macroimmunology: The drivers and consequences of spatial patterns in wildlife immune defence.Journal of Animal Ecology,89, 972-995. Ecoimmunology seeks to identify and explain natural variation in immune function. Most research so far has focused on differences among individuals within populations, which are often driven by trade-offs in resource allocation between energetically costly immunity and competing processes such as reproduction. In their review article, Becker et al. (2020) have proposed a framework to explicitly address habitat- and population-level differences in wildlife immune phenotypes. Termed macroimmunology, this concept integrates principles from ecoimmunology and macroecology. Becker et al. (2020) have highlighted three non-mutually exclusive habitat features that are likely to vary at spatial scales and influence immune function: (a) parasite pressure, (b) abiotic and biotic factors and (c) anthropogenic changes. However, a large and robust body of literature suitable for synthesis to detect macroimmunology patterns and effect sizes is not yet available. Through their systematic review and critical assessment, Becker et al. (2020) identified common problems in existing research that hinders spatial inferences, such as a need for spatial replication in study design and statistical analyses that account for spatial dependence. Overall, macroimmunology has the potential to identify and even predict spatial patterns in immune phenotypes that form the mechanistic underpinnings of important wildlife disease processes, and this review represents an important step to realizing these goals.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive literature review using a systematic approach to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting sustainable development in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The systematic review approach was applied to collect and analyze topics, and the literature search was conducted in two stages, encompassing 57 articles that met the research requirements. Our analysis reveals that AI's contribution to sustainability is concentrated within three key areas: organizational, technical, and processing aspects. The organizational aspect focuses on the integration of AI in companies and industries, addressing barriers to implementation and the relationship between companies, partners, and customers. The technical aspect highlights the development of AI algorithms that can address global challenges and contribute to the growth of stability and development in society. The processing aspect emphasizes the internal transformation of companies, their business models, and strategies in response to AI integration. Our proposed conceptual model outlines the essential elements organizations must consider when incorporating AI into their sustainability efforts, such as strategic alignment, infrastructure development, change management, and continuous improvement. By addressing these critical aspects, organizations can harness the potential of AI to drive positive social, environmental, and economic outcomes, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. The model serves as a comprehensive framework for organizations seeking to leverage AI for sustainable development, but it should be adapted to individual contexts to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

AB  - Heavy metals occur naturally in very small amounts in living organisms, but exposure to their higher concentrations is hazardous. Heavy metals at hazardous levels are commonly found in foodstuffs of Bangladesh, mainly due to the lack of safety guidelines and poor management of industrial effluents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the level of heavy metals in foodstuffs of Bangladesh is higher than the acceptable limits set by World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization. Literature survey revealed that the sources and transport pathways of heavy metals in the ecosystem and the abundance of heavy metals in the food products of Bangladesh are potential threats to food safety. However, an extensive assessment of the toxicity of heavy metals in food webs is lacking. Although widespread heavy metal contamination in various foodstuffs and environmental matrices have been summarized in some reports, a critical evaluation regarding multi-trophic transfer and the health risk of heavy metal exposure through food chain toxicity in Bangladesh has not been performed. This systematic review critically discussed heavy metal contamination, exposure toxicity, research gaps, existing legislation, and sustainable remediation strategies to enhance Bangladesh's food safety. In particular, this study for the first time explored the potential multi-trophic transfer of heavy metals via food webs in Bangladesh. Furthermore, we recommended a conceptual policy framework to combat heavy metal contaminations in Bangladesh.

AB  - Monitoring the progress parties have made toward meeting global biodiversity targets requires appropriate indicators. The recognition of invasive alien species (IAS) as a biodiversity threat has led to the development of specific targets aiming at reducing their prevalence and impact. However, indicators for adequately monitoring and reporting on the status of biological invasions have been slow to emerge, with those that exist being arguably insufficient. We performed a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to assess the adequacy of existing IAS indicators against a range of policy-relevant and scientifically valid properties. We found that very few indicators have most of the desirable properties and that existing indicators are unevenly spread across the components of the Driver-Pressure-State-Response and Theory of Change frameworks. We provide three possible reasons for this: (i) inadequate attention paid to the requirements of an effective IAS indicator, (ii) insufficient data required to populate and inform policy-relevant, scientifically robust indicators, or (iii) deficient investment in the development and maintenance of IAS indicators. This review includes an analysis of where current inadequacies in IAS indicators exist and provides a roadmap for the future development of indicators capable of measuring progress made toward mitigating and halting biological invasions.

AB  - To promote the sustainability of forest ecosystems and maintain ecosystem services to human populations in the context of climate change, forest managers are considering several adaptation tools. One of those, assisted migration, consists of displacing tree species and/or populations to locations with suitable future climate conditions. Assisted migration plantations, however, could fail to produce viable forests under high herbivory pressure from mammalian herbivores. Thus, selecting species and genotypes with low susceptibility to herbivores could be a key condition for the recruitment of translocated seedlings. We developed an approach to predict susceptibility to mammalian herbivores, based on the seedlings' chemical content (a proxy of phytochemical defence and susceptibility to herbivores). We used the approach on eight North American tree species of three climate analogues regions each (i.e. locations where the current climate is similar to the future climate at plantation site). We built chemical profiles and ranked species and climate analogue based on their potential susceptibility. To assess the reliability of our approach, we compared the chemical profiles to a systematic review of these species' chemistry and of mammalian browsing throughout their native geographic range. For most species, our chemical profiles and browse susceptibility rankings were congruent with information available in the literature, both for phytochemical defence and for browsing. Two of the eight species (Pinus strobus and Thuja occidentalis) were more susceptible than predicted based on their chemical profile. These discrepancies could be linked to specific mammalian herbivores, that were unaffected by the phytochemical defence of these species. We observed a generally higher susceptibility of broadleaf species, which could be taken into account when devising adaptive silvicultural strategies. Furthermore, we propose the chemical profiling approach as a preliminary screening tool to identify species more resistant to mammalian herbivores, but also potentially to other herbivores and pathogens. Our chemical profile approach, based on the objective assessment of multivariate analyses results, could be replicated to compare the potential susceptibility of other species. This approach could be especially useful when contending with novel plant-herbivore relationships, such as forestry and conservation assisted migration or species invasion.

AB  - Understanding the evidence-based factors that influence the adoption of organic farming yields benefits in terms of managing said adoption effectively. We searched relevant articles published in databases including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google. The inclusion criteria were as follows: original article; published in journals, proceedings, or dissertations; full article publication; published between 1999 and 2021; focusing on assessing the adoption of organic farming or conversion to organic farming; published in English; included data analyzed via correlation coefficient analysis, regression analysis, or discriminant analysis. Out of the 50 articles identified, 33 studies described findings associated with farmer and household factors, 32 described psychobehavioral and psychosocial factors, 36 assessed farming factors, and 33 analyzed supportive factors. The literature provides evidence that relevant factors include the following: (1) farmer and household factors (i.e., gender, off-farm income, and level of education); (2) psycho-behavioral and psychosocial factors (i.e., positive attitude, normative and moral obligations); (3) farming factors (i.e., organic farm experience, production cost, and farm ownership); (4) supportive factors (i.e., training, support of technology, organic farmer neighbors, information acquisition, membership of association, and extension contacts). To promote the adoption of organic farming, extension agents play a vital role in the provision of information via training and the encouragement of conventional farmers to shift towards organic agriculture. The target groups that have the greatest potential for the adoption of organic farming are young farmers, females, individuals who have ownership of their farm, those with a high level of education, and farmers with off-farm income. Farm associations also play a vital role in the sharing of experience and in increasing bargaining power. Support by the government in terms of resources, credit, markets, and subsidy is also relevant in motivating organic farming adoption. Therefore, three sectors, extension agents, farm associations, and the government, are key drivers for the sustainable adoption of organic farming.

AB  - Smart cities emerge as a viable solution for the design and management of urban centers increasingly concerned with issues related to improving sustainability and resilience. The chapter seeks to enrich discussions on the subject of smart cities by carrying out a systematic review of the literature on the importance of enabling technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the formulation of public policies for smart cities. On the occasion, issues related to the advancement of enabling technologies for Industry 4.0 in Brazil and how these technologies are understood, from the point of view of their importance, by public agents responsible for formulating public policies for smart cities in the country, were addressed. As a result of the investigation, it became clear that, in the case of emerging countries, such as Brazil, the definition of objectives and approaches for the solution of urban problems that can be addressed through public policies based on technologies for smart cities must, above all, take into account the various human and environmental factors inherent to society, whose demands are intended to be met. In addition, the conscious action of public agents, mainly in the political sphere, can eventually contribute to the failure to conduct projects categorized in the literature as smart-washed cities.

AB  - The escalating pace of construction activities has triggered a concerning surge in waste accumulation, underscoring the urgent need for the construction industry to prioritise environmental sustainability and resource conservation. Research indicates that construction waste (CW) from a typical building project can comprise a substantial 30% of the total weight of materials transported to the site. Significantly, one-third of this waste could be avoided through judicious decision-making in the design phase. While waste management during construction has gained substantial attention in the existing literature, the domain of decision-making in the design stage remains relatively unexplored. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) of 59 articles from 2011 to 2022. The findings emphasise the crucial role of informed decision-making processes in minimising CW during building projects. A conceptual framework emerges from the analysis, highlighting the necessity of establishing a foundation for design decision-making to tackle CW issues effectively. Collaborative networks among stakeholders and an enhanced supply chain, bolstered by robust information sharing, are identified as pivotal factors in improving CW minimisation efforts. Consequently, this study advocates for further research to expand the knowledge base in this vital area, underscoring the imperative for collective efforts in advancing sustainable practices within the construction industry.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a major fertiliser for agriculture and food production. About 67.84 million tons of N are annually applied to agricultural fields, without which nearly half of the world's population would not be alive today. Returning plant residues to the soil is an alternative and sustainable way of N fertilisation. Although impacts of returning plant residues on plant available N in soil have been widely studied, there is still no systematic review of their mechanisms and models. In this review we highlight the following advances: (1) When plant residues are returned to the soil, N undergoes biotic immobilisation-remineralisation, abiotic immobilisation, soil organic N mineralisation and plant residue organic N mineralisation. (2) Plant residues modify inorganic N fate using three mechanism mineralisation, immobilisation-mineralisation and immobilisation, depending on plant residue nature and soil properties. (3) The use of plant residue C/N ratio is not always effective to predict the effect of plant residues. Instead, soil properties and the forms of carbon and nitrogen should be considered. (4) Mineralisation always promotes N uptake by crops and increases the risk of N loss. In addition, although net immobilisation is involved in immobilisation-mineralisation and immobilisation, it does not necessarily induce lower crop nitrogen uptake. Results also depend on the synchronism between the changing soil inorganic N and the crop N uptake. (5) N loss during mineralisation can be reduced by an immobiliser. Net N immobilisation during immobilisation-mineralisation and immobilisation can be reduced by changing the timing of ploughing and fertilising or by changing the plant residues placement.

AB  - Background: Treatment of chronic pain is challenging and there is often failure of recovery, with the need to look at different approaches in its management. Central mechanisms may contribute to chronicity (i.e. disturbance in body schema). Laterality judgment is dependent on body schema and can determine affected central mechanisms. Objective: This review aimed to determine whether there are laterality judgment differences between chronic pain and pain-free individuals. Methods: A search was done of various databases, using combinations of keywords, and reference lists of full-text articles. Articles were considered from inception until February 2018. Eighteen studies were included. Methodological quality was assessed by two reviewers using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. Studies were analyzed broadly then divided into subgroups. A meta-analysis or narrative review was done. Results: There was high heterogeneity for broad outcome measures, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS1), and upper limb pain. Analysis for accuracy in lower limb conditions showed a medium significant effect size (0.59) and significant 95%CI (0.11-1.07). Low back and cervical pain results could not be pooled into meta-analysis (due to different methods of reporting). Conclusions: Laterality judgment impairment was shown in CPRS1, upper limb pain, hand and wrist pain, carpal-tunnel syndrome, facial pain, knee osteoarthritis, and leg pain. No conclusions could be drawn in low back pain, due to the low-quality evidence and differing results. There was no impairment in whiplash-associated disorders and nonspecific cervical pain showed conflicting evidence.

AB  - Background: Despite the acknowledged promise of developing a public health systems research (PHSR) agenda for emergency preparedness, there has been no systematic review of the literature in this area. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review in order to identify and characterize the PHSR literature produced in the U.S. in the past 11 years in the field of public health emergency preparedness.
   Evidence acquisition: Articles were searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as in the gray literature. Two independent reviewers classified the articles according to study design and IOM public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) research goal areas.
   Evidence synthesis: From January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2008, there were 547 articles that met the inclusion criteria that were published. It was possible to classify 314 (57%) articles into at least one of the four IOM PHEP research goal areas. Of these, 61 (11%) addressed Research Area I (usefulness of training); 39 (7%) addressed Research Area 2 (communications in preparedness and response); 193 (35%) addressed Research Area 3 (sustainable preparedness and response systems); and 39 (7%) addressed Research Area 4 (criteria and metrics to measure effectiveness and efficiency). Twenty-one studies (4%) could be classified into more than one category. The majority of the articles (81%), including commentaries/reviews and case studies, were based on qualitative analysis. Commentaries/review articles were the most common study types (62%).
   Conclusions: Since 2001, the PHSR literature on PHEP issues has grown at about 33% per year. However, most studies lack a rigorous design, raising questions about the validity of the results.

AB  - Aim Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally.
   Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications-i.e., from non-additive effects-between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date.
   Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.

AB  - Although ambitious, forest landscape restoration (FLR) is still very high on global climate change mitigation and adaptation research and policy agendas. The scientific literature highlights the importance of institutions and actors' collaboration for achieving the intended outcomes. Despite these diffuse indications, a comprehensive understanding of the role played by different types of actors and institutions in shaping FLR outcomes is missing. This hinders the definition of an actor-cum-institutions research agenda for FLR, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet, in this region, different actors with diverse interests shape FLR practices. Likewise, formal and informal institutions are known to collide frequently. Hence, this paper addresses the lacunae by systematically reviewing FLR actors' interests and power manifestations and the typologies of institutions linked to FLR outcomes in SSA. The review further defines future research agendas on actors and institutions in SSA. The following lessons can be drawn from the review of 75 peer-reviewed journal articles: First, while exogenous actors are interested more in the ecological benefits of FLR, endogenous actors are interested in economic ones. Second, exogenous actors mostly use (dis-)incentives and coercion to shape the behavior of endogenous actors in FLR. Finally, while the exogenous formal institutional typology produces positive and negative ecological, economic, political, and sociocultural FLR outcomes, the endogenous formal and informal institutions produce only positive outcomes. Future studies should identify actors' compliance levels of the exogenous and endogenous formal and informal typologies of institutions. Future studies should also analyze the effectiveness of FLR-linked institutions towards ensuring successful FLR.

AB  - Rapidly evolving environmental problems in urban areas require new policy directions. However, the policy change process can be hard to comprehend, making it difficult to foster needed change. In this paper, a systematic review of international empirical research on sustainable urban water policy is used to identify key factors shaping local policy innovation. Those factors are then compared to leading theories of the policy process or technology change in order to place the results within a broader theoretical context. This article is meant to aid policy actors seeking to manage change, as well as students and scholars seeking an overview of this complex field. Thirty drivers of policy change are described and organized into a categorical framework under governance, environment or innovation design. Some drivers of change, such as household income or political orientation, are less easily altered by change agents than others, such as convening collaborations, exercising leadership and expanding organizational capacity. The comparison to policy theories suggests a convergence of theoretical and empirical literatures. Some drivers, like change agency and social context, are "theoretically ubiquitous," by occurring in every theory, while others, like power, organizational capacity and natural conditions, are "theoretically prevalent," by occurring in most. The Advocacy Coalition Framework and the Multilevel Perspective are theories which incorporate the most factors at play. They also share an interest in change being driven by social networks coalescing around shared beliefs in what is possible or desirable.

AB  - Climate change presents the greatest challenge facing all countries of the world in the new millennium. Among others, objective 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims at adopting urgent measures to contrast climate change and its consequences. Part of the decline in the global growth of emissions has been the increase in using renewable energies. In this context, the relationship among GDP, CO2 emissions, and renewable energy use has been investigated in this study, starting from a systematic review that has noticed the presence of three clusters focused on: CO2 emissions, GDP, and energy consumption. Despite the current level of interest in examining the relationship among these variables, there have been few empirical studies. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper has been focused on the Scandinavian countries, where the use of renewable energies has steadily increased, developing novel panel analysis estimates. Using a dataset of these five economies over a 1990-2018 time period, several panel data tests have been carried out, in order to robustly assess the causality issue among renewable energies, CO2 emissions, and GDP. The results of the empirical analysis imply that renewable energy consumption is a useful policy instrument to reduce CO2 emissions without adversely affecting GDP growth. The main implications have been that the decrease of CO2 emissions, by increasing renewable energy use, can guarantee high levels of energy efficiency and economic growth. These empirical findings help design innovative energy policy roadmaps and accelerate the ecological transition through the promotion of renewable energy and the reduction of GHG emissions.

AB  - This article synthesizes the evidence on food value chains (FVCs) and regional food hubs (RFHs) through a systematic literature review and suggests future research directions based on the gaps identified in the review. The number of publications on FVCs and RFHs is increasing, indicating that these topics are gaining interest among scholars from different countries and disciplines. Bibliometric analysis and preferred reporting items for systematic review and a meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart are used to identify the data from Scopus. The results show that FVCs are an innovative solution to improve the skills and capacity of smallholder farmers through collaborative networks that can match the functions of RFHs. RFHs connect local producers and customers by operating a business based on social entrepreneurship and ecological approaches to increase local economic viability and the sustainability of agriculture products. FVCs and RFHs are designed to respond to supply chain insecurity with value-based approaches in order to achieve sustainable nutrition for the local community. Further research on FVCs and RFHs emphasizes that the business model of regional development in developing countries can improve food security sustainability based on social entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the environmental aspect that it can use to support the sustainability of developing countries local food.

AB  - The ubiquity of microplastics ecosystems has gained global attention. In this context, Latin America, which is responsible for 8% of the world's consumption of plastic material and has a small recycling rate (4.5%), does not have enough data on microplastics contamination in its environmental matrices. This systematic review analyzed 196 studies from 16 territorials in Latin America and provided information about the current state of knowledge regarding the abundance, distribution, and associated impact of microplastics in different matrices. This review also describes the analytical procedures of sampling, extraction, identification, and characterization methodologies adopted by the literature review. The analysis shows that most of the studies that investigate microplastics abundance were carried out in the marine environment (59%), and there is an insufficient investigation on microplastics abundance in freshwater bodies (16%). Among all the studies, the highest microplastics concentration was observed in regions with high population density and/or in locations without proper sanitation and solid waste management. Additionally, the difference among microplastics abundance in the studies might be associated with the different analytical procedures employed to investigate microplastics. Lastly, knowledge gaps are identified, and recommendations are proposed to guide future studies on microplastics contamination.

AB  - The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for green retrofitting is a recent development due to its integrated solutions for evaluating and monitoring the environmental sustainability performance of existing buildings. It can be implemented throughout different stages of building life cycle using centralized digital models. However, the actual applications of such technology are still scarce and require further study and verification. In this paper, a systematic review of the recent development of BIM was conducted on two related areas: (a) existing buildings' sustainability performance and (b) green retrofitting. The review highlights that little work has been conducted on these two areas concurrently which is mainly at the exploration stage. The results further reveal common BIM sustainability tools, performance parameters and design parameters in the recent research on the green retrofitting of existing buildings. Furthermore, a research framework has been developed to fill the research gaps and future needs in the implementation of BIM for green retrofitting, including data acquisition techniques, integrated process, unified platform, data interoperability and management, level of automation, design alteration as well as auto data feedback. This paper provides new insights into both theoretical developments and practical or technical aspects of BIM in fostering a complete green retrofit ecosystem.

AB  - Background: The expansion of oil palm agriculture across the nations, especially in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, is growing at exacerbated levels. However, there is still a lack of awareness of the environmental, social, and economic challenges among the sector, ranging from the combination of ecological, economic, and ecosystem sustainability to the livelihoods of plantation workers and small holder communities. Small holders struggle to attain the primary standards on market governance, debt-free livelihood enhancements, certification norms, proper land rights and usage, outsourcing quality seeds, harvesting technologies, labor usage, etc. Method: There is a need to systematize the existing literature toward one that addresses the most fundamental and urgent questions that govern the palm oil small holder sustainability in the palm oil supply chain. The objective of this article is two-fold. One approach was to undertake an integrated systematic review and thematic scientific mapping of the last 10 years of research effort (2009-2020) on the specified research agenda, using data from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database. Another objective was to gain insights and research direction. Results: The defined gaps and insights from the study helped to form the basis for developing a conceptual framework for achieving the sustainability and livelihood of small holders in the palm oil sector. Conclusions: There is a stringent need to focus on the sustainability factors of small holders in the palm oil upstream logistics to address and improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain.

AB  - Environmental alliances are a common response to societal sustainability demands. In environmental alliances, firms collaboratively exploit and explore environmental technologies to address market opportunities while simultaneously generating positive environmental impacts. A striking idiosyncrasy is that in addition to economic value, environmental alliances generate two types of external value: environmental value from positive effects on air, water, land and biodiversity, and knowledge value from innovations in environmental technologies. Research on motivations for environmental alliances is dispersed and underdeveloped compared to the well-established literature on motivations for strategic alliances that emphasize economic value. This study therefore develops a classification of motivations for environmental alliances by combining the literature on strategic alliances and that on environmental and knowledge value. The resulting classification includes motivations for environmental alliances to generate environmental and knowledge value as well as motivations to create economic value by internalizing environmental and knowledge value. A systematic review of 123 articles on environmental inter-firm alliances identifies specific motivations to populate the new classification. We show that alliance partners are motivated to share sustainable resources, reduce sustainability risk, respond to stakeholders or invest in specific sustainable assets to generate external value. They collaborate to reduce costs or enhance competitive advantage, reputation or legitimacy to internalize external value. The resource-based view, resource-dependence view, institutional theory and transaction cost economics have not previously distinguished between motivations to generate and internalize external value. We extend their area of application from strategic alliances to environmental alliances, and thus beyond the exclusive pursuit of economic value.

AB  - Environmental pollution by anthropogenic litter is a global concern, but studies specifically addressing the interaction between macroplastics and macroinvertebrates in streams are scarce. However, several studies on plant litter decomposition in streams have also used plastic strips as a methodological approach to assess if macroinvertebrates colonize plant litter mostly as a substrate or a food resource. Looking at these studies from the plastic strips perspective may provide useful information on the interaction between macroplastics and macroinvertebrates in streams. I carried out a meta-analysis of 18 studies that have compared macroinvertebrate colonization of macroplastic litter and plant litter in streams to estimate the overall macroinvertebrate colonization of macroplastic litter relative to plant litter, and identify moderators of this difference. Macroinvertebrate colonization of macroplastic litter was overall lower (by similar to 40%) compared with plant litter. However, differences in macroinvertebrate colonization between macroplastic litter and plant litter were observed when considering leaf litter but not wood litter, which may be a poorer substrate and food resource for macroinvertebrates. Also, differences in macroinvertebrate colonization between macroplastic litter and leaf litter were observed for shredders, collectors and predators, but not for grazers that may feed on the biofilm developed on macroplastics. Macroplastic litter supported lower macroinvertebrate density, biomass, abundance, and richness, but higher macroinvertebrate diversity than leaf litter. Higher macroinvertebrate diversity on macroplastic litter may have occurred when macroplastics represented more heterogeneous substrates (e.g., mixture of plastic types) than leaf litter (e.g., needles). Differences in macroinvertebrate abundance between macroplastic litter and leaf litter were not significantly affected by plastic type, mesh opening size, plant functional group or plant identity. By testing previously untested hypotheses, this meta-analysis guides future empirical studies. Future studies should also consider the geographical areas most affected by macroplastic pollution and the plastic types most often found in the streams.

AB  - In the last few years, research in the field of sustainability has experienced a significant increase in interest between sustainability and other areas (inclusive education, active methodologies, and society). Moreover, the use of mixed research methods (quantitative and qualitative) along with the application of data mining techniques, enables the analysis of information and the connection between the different studies. The objectives of this paper were: (1) To establish the results of the research related to the concepts of sustainability, inclusive education, and disability. (2) To study the key concepts that are detected in the articles selected with respect to the concepts of sustainability, inclusive education, disability, and their relations. In order to do so, two studies were carried out (quantitative and qualitative). In the first study, K-means and heat map clustering techniques were applied. In the second study, the technique of text mining was applied. One hundred and thirty-three scientific papers were studied, of which 54 fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Three clusters were found in the first study; cluster 1 included the categories: inclusive society, educational innovation, and active methodologies. Cluster 2 included active methodologies and society and economy and cluster 3 included inclusive society and society and economy. In the second study, the highest Krippendorff's Alpha coefficient were found in articles that linked sustainability with social transformation stemming from a change in education by means of the use of active teaching methods and technological resources. The research moves towards the development of competencies in sustainability at all stages of the educational system, and in all areas of knowledge.

AB  - Background Few people in most developed nations engage in regular physical activity (PA), despite its well-established health benefits. Socioecological models highlight the potential interaction of multiple factors from policy and the built environment to individual social cognition in explaining PA.
   Objective The purpose of this review was to appraise this interaction tenet of the socioecological model between the built environment and social cognition to predict PA.
   Methods Eligible studies had to have been published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language, and included any tests of interaction between social cognition and the built environment with PA. Literature searches, concluded in October 2017, used five common databases. Findings were grouped by type of PA outcomes (leisure, transportation, total PA and total moderate-vigorous PA [MVPA]), then grouped by the type of interactions between social cognitive and built environment constructs.
   Results The initial search yielded 308 hits, which was reduced to 22 independent studies of primarily high-to medium-quality after screening for eligibility criteria. The interaction tenet of the socioecological model was not supported for overall MVPA and total PA. By contrast, while there was heterogeneity of findings for leisure-time PA, environmental accessibility/convenience interacted with intention, and environmental aesthetics interacted with affective judgments, to predict leisure-time PA. Interactions between the built environment and social cognition in PA for transport are limited, with current results failing to support an effect.
   Conclusions The results provide some support for interactive aspects of the built environment and social cognition in leisure-time PA, and thus highlight potential areas for integrated intervention of individual and environmental change.

AB  - Fresh fruit and vegetables are crucial for human health. Their fibrous structure and high nutritional value are essential for people's well-being. This study aims to provide a review of the current state of knowledge and practices regarding fresh fruit and vegetable supply chains (FFVSC). The reviewed papers are divided into categories according to their findings, research purposes, tools and messages used. Our objective is to guide both academics and practitioners by pointing out significant streams of research with respect to these categories. For a better understanding, these subgroups are essentially based on their common research purpose, and the tools and methods they adopted are explained. Therefore, this study sheds light on research related to FFVSCs for those who are new to this area or planning to conduct in-depth research on directions suggested by studies in this area. The related literature was classified into eight categories: namely, (1) value chain indicators of FFVSCs, (2) food-related problems/postharvest losses along FFVSCs, (3) roles of parties involved in the FFV value chain, (4) review papers, (5) technological trends in FFVSCs, (6) packaging issues of FFVSCs, (7) logistics solutions of FFVSCs, and (8) sustainable FFVSCs. Details on the tools and methods employed in these studies are summarized in Appendix B. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the related literature lacks a comprehensive review that investigates different aspects of FFVVCs in detail. Thus, this study contributes towards a better understanding of the related literature and can be used as a guide for future studies.

AB  - The perceived inability of climate change mitigation goals alone to mobilize sufficient climate change mitigation efforts has, among other factors, led to growing research on the co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study conducts a systematic review (SR) of the literature on the co-benefits of mitigating GHG emissions resulting in 1554 papers. We analyze these papers using bibliometric analysis, including a keyword co-occurrence analysis. We then iteratively develop and present a typology of co-benefits, mitigation sectors, geographic scope, and methods based on the manual double coding of the papers resulting from the SR. We find that the co-benefits from GHG mitigation that have received the largest attention of researchers are impacts on ecosystems, economic activity, health, air pollution, and resource efficiency. The co-benefits that have received the least attention include the impacts on conflict and disaster resilience, poverty alleviation (or exacerbation), energy security, technological spillovers and innovation, and food security. Most research has investigated co-benefits from GHG mitigation in the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), electricity, transport, and residential sectors, with the industrial sector being the subject of significantly less research. The largest number of co-benefits publications provide analysis at a global level, with relatively few studies providing local (city) level analysis or studying co-benefits in Oceanian or African contexts. Finally, science and engineering methods, in contrast to economic or social sciencemethods, are the methods most commonly employed in co-benefits papers. We conclude that given the potential mobilizing power of understudied co-benefits (e. g. poverty alleviation) and local impacts, the magnitude of GHG emissions from the industrial sector, and the fact that Africa and South America are likely to be severely affected by climate change, there is an opportunity for the research community to fill these gaps.

AB  - Extra virgin olive oil is constantly gaining interest for its outstanding health and nutritional properties. However, the production process generates roughly four times more waste than the quantity of oil. For this reason, improvements in extra virgin olive oil production and in the valorisation of olive mill by-products are urgently needed, thus motivating this work. The first aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge regarding machines, plants, and processes in extra virgin olive oil production. The second aim is to suggest specific innovations and improvement strategies to increase sustainability, productivity, profitability, and quality. This review clearly highlighted the copious advantages of modern production plants, which can control oxidation processes, avoid temperature increases, and significantly improve the quality of extra virgin olive oil. However, the production chain must face the monumental environmental sustainability challenge. In this direction, this review highlighted that scientific and technological research has made great strides in managing olive mill by-products, suggesting several strategies related to the recovery of polyphenols and applications in agriculture, feed, and food. However, to succeed in this ambitious project, harmonious teamwork between European policies, states, regions, and private companies is needed.

AB  - Based on a systematic review of 17 recent substance flow analyses of phosphorus (P) at the regional and country scales, this study presents an assessment of the magnitude of anthropogenic P storage in the agricultural production and the waste management systems to identify the potential for minimizing unnecessary P storage to reduce the input of P as mineral fertilizer and the loss of P. The assessment indicates that in case of all (6) P flow analyses at the regional scale, the combined mass of annual P storage in the agricultural production and the waste management systems is greater than 50 % of the mass of annual P inflow as mineral fertilizer in the agricultural production system, while this is close to or more than 100 % in case of half of these analyses. At the country scale, in case of the majority (7 out of 11) of analyses, the combined mass of annual P storage in the agricultural production and the waste management systems has been found to be roughly equivalent or greater than 100 % of the mass of annual P inflow as mineral fertilizer in the agricultural production system, while it ranged from 30 to 60 % in the remaining analyses. A simple scenario analysis has revealed that the annual storage of P in this manner over 100 years could result in the accumulation of a massive amount of P in the agricultural production and the waste management systems at both the regional and country scales. This study suggests that sustainable P management initiatives at the regional and country scales should put more emphasis on minimizing unwanted P storage in the agricultural production and the waste management systems.

AB  - This study adapts and applies the evidence-based approach for causal inference, a medical standard, to the restoration and sustainable management of large-scale aquatic ecosystems. Despite long-term investments in restoring aquatic ecosystems, it has proven difficult to adequately synthesize and evaluate program outcomes, and no standard method has been adopted. Complex linkages between restorative actions and ecosystem responses at a landscape scale make evaluations problematic and most programs focus on monitoring and analysis. Herein, we demonstrate a new transdisciplinary approach integrating techniques from evidence-based medicine, critical thinking, and cumulative effects assessment. Tiered hypotheses about the effects of landscape-scale restorative actions are identified using an ecosystem conceptual model. The systematic literature review, a health sciences standard since the 1960s, becomes just one of seven lines of evidence assessed collectively, using critical thinking strategies, causal criteria, and cumulative effects categories. As a demonstration, we analyzed data from 166 locations on the Columbia River and estuary representing 12 indicators of habitat and fish response to floodplain restoration actions intended to benefit culturally and economically important, threatened and endangered salmon. Synthesis of the lines of evidence demonstrated that hydrologic reconnection promoted macrodetritis export, prey availability, and juvenile fish access and feeding. Upon evaluation, the evidence was sufficient to infer cross-boundary, indirect, compounding, and delayed cumulative effects, and suggestive of nonlinear, landscape-scale, and spatial density effects. Therefore, on the basis of causal inferences regarding food-web functions, we concluded that the restoration program is having a cumulative beneficial effect on juvenile salmon. The lines of evidence developed are transferable to other ecosystems: modeling of cumulative net ecosystem improvement, physical modeling of ecosystem controlling factors, meta-analysis of restoration action effectiveness, analysis of data on target species, research on critical ecological uncertainties, evidence-based review of the literature, and change analysis on the landscape setting. As with medicine, the science of ecological restoration needs scientific approaches to management decisions, particularly because the consequences affect species extinctions and the availability of ecosystem services. This evidence-based approach will enable restoration in complex coastal, riverine, and tidal-fluvial ecosystems like the lower Columbia River to be evaluated when data have accumulated without sufficient synthesis.

AB  - Ecological restoration projects are becoming a mainstream of research, and their studies are widely followed by scholars worldwide, yet there is no comprehensive review of this research. Nowadays, bibliometrics has attracted much attention from the scientific community, and its methodological approach allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of research performance in journals or subject areas. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive description of the progress and hotspots of ecological restoration projects from a bibliometric perspective, based on 1173 articles in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. Research on ecological restoration projects has shown a positive growth trend since the twenty-first century. China and the USA are the most active countries in terms of the number of relevant articles published, and more than half of the top 10 active institutions are from China, but there is less collaboration between different countries/institutions. Research in ecological restoration projects is summarized into three main research areas: the main ecological damage problems, the impact of human beings on ecological damage, and the main methods of ecological restoration. Finally, some challenges and outlooks conducive to the rapid and balanced development of ecological restoration projects are presented, which provide valuable references and help for future researchers.

AB  - The forces of digital transformation have delivered significant benefits like sustainable development and economic growth in a range of early adopter industries such as retail and manufacturing but, despite these potential benefits, the resource and energy sectors have been relative latecomers to digitalization simply because they are frequently slower to absorb new technologies. Here we present the results of a systematic literature review identifying the ways in which digital technologies have been applied in the oil and gas, mining, and energy domains. We applied content and descriptive analysis to evaluate and discuss 151 academic articles selected from the Scopus database. Two particularly interesting trends emerge from the analysis. First, over 75% of the papers were about the energy sector excluding the oil & gas industry, and only a small minority were from the mining or oil & gas sectors. Second, the most frequently discussed objective of digital transformation was the reduction of operational expenses. By surveying the different ways in which these innovations have been used in these industries and identifying trends and patterns in how digital technologies have been applied, the findings of this review deepen our understanding of the current state of digital technologies within the resource and energy sectors and, in so doing, shine a useful amount of light on the contributions that digital transformation has made to businesses in these sectors. This paper also highlights for future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers the six research areas that they should focus on in the future to help the resource and energy sectors accelerate the digital transformation process and improve their ability to deliver value with these innovations.

AB  - The aim of the current research was to systematically review and summarize the studies that evaluated the concentration of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in cow milk in different regions of Iran and to perform a meta-analysis of the findings. Moreover, the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Pb and Cd through milk consumption in adult and child consumers were assessed. As a result of a systematic search in the international and national databases between January 2008 and October 2018, 17 reports involving 1874 samples were incorporated in our study for meta-analysis. The pooled concentrations of Pb and Cd were estimated to be 13.95 mu g mL(-1) (95% CI 9.72-18.11 mu g mL(-1)) and 3.55 mu g mL(-1) (95% CI - 2.38-9.48 mu g mL(-1)), respectively, which were lower than the WHO/FAO and national standard limits. The estimated weekly intake (EWI) of Pb and Cd through consuming milk was 16.65 and 7 mu g day(-1) for adults of 70 kg and 45 and 34 mu g day(-1) for children of 26 kg, respectively, which was well below the risk values set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The maximum target hazard quotient values (THQs) of Pb and Cd were 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for adults and 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for children, respectively, which were lower than 1 value, suggesting that Iranian consumers are not exposed to non-carcinogenic risk through consuming milk. Moreover, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of Pb estimated to be 2.96E-04 in adults and 1.0E-03 in children, indicating that consumers in Iran are at threshold carcinogenic risk of Pb through consuming milk (ILCR > 10(-4)). Therefore, planning and policy making for the sustainable reduction of these toxic metals in milk, particularly in industrial regions of Iran, are crucial.

AB  - Recently, decarbonizing the maritime industry, which accounts for 2.8% of world emissions, has become essential. However, as a crucial component of maritime transportation, container shipping also carries substantial significance. In this context, the International Maritime Organization endeavors to endorse several projects and methods to mitigate maritime transport emissions. As a result, this research assesses frameworks, infrastructure, training, and other critical factors to analyze multiple operational and technological possibilities for predicted decarbonization solutions in container shipping using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to assess ship owners' and stakeholders' desires. It employs a comprehensive methodology that begins with a systematic literature review using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method to prepare questionaries, followed by an MCDM analysis using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods to examine the results. This research contributes to the scholarly discourse on reducing the emissions of maritime transportation. According to the findings, operational alternatives, such as ship speed, trim, and maritime route optimizations, are considerably more appealing than design and technology solutions, such as technically advanced ship hulls or machinery reforms. The pragmatic advantages of the operational alternatives, such as lower costs and shorter implementation schedules, stimulate their adoption. In contrast, design and technological solutions can influence emission reductions in the long term. It is possible to find operational alternatives for short-term decarbonization, while technological and design advancements can aid in long-term emission reductions in container shipping.

AB  - Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.

AB  - The consumption of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFA) is considered to protect against cardiovascular disease and promote longevity following a heart attack. Historically, research in this area was fuelled by compelling reports of the cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 PUFA in select populations and cultures. More recent studies, in wider populations, suggest discordant findings: differences that are difficult to reconcile as the mechanism of action of omega-3 PUFA are poorly understood. As such, the use of this 'natural treatment' for cardiovascular disease is increasingly controversial, and potentially one of unfulfilled promise. To what extent does ethnicity influence the impact that omega-3 PUFA have on cardiovascular disease and its associated complications? We were interested to review the benefits of omega-3 PUFA in the management of cardiovascular risk amongst diverse ethnic groups. Using a systematic review of literature relating to omega-3 PUFA and cardiovascular disease, we found ethnicity to be a factor that accounts for inconsistency between studies. Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are limited to cultures with a very high omega-3 intake, and in turn, ethnicity moderates the efficiency with which PUFA are derived from the diet. Moreover, omega-3 PUFA are an important health care intervention in the current climate of globalization, where supplementation is likely to give protection to cultural groups undergoing dietary transition. Future epidemiological research into the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in cardiovascular disease should consider the influence of ethnicity.

AB  - Increased levels of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, a legacy of the industrial revolution, population growth pressures, and consumerist lifestyle choices, are the main contributors to human-induced climate change. Climate change is commensurate of warming temperatures, reductions in rainfall, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and contributions toward declining public health trends. Green Infrastructure (GI) presents diverse opportunities to mediate adverse effects, while simultaneously delivering human health, well-being, environmental, economic, and social benefits to contemporary urban dwellers. To identify the current state of GI knowledge, a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed articles (n = 171) was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. Temporal publication trends, geographical and geological information of research efforts, as well as research focus areas were recorded and reported against each article. The findings of this review confirm the research area to be in a state of development in most parts of the world, with the vast majority of the research emerging from the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Cooler climates produced the majority of research, which were found largely to be of a traditional research article format. The GI research area is firmly dominated by foci comprising planning and policy, environmental and ecological, and social content, although modest attempts have also appeared in health and wellbeing, economic, and quality/performance of green infrastructure areas. Knowledge gaps identified by this review as requiring attention for research growth were identified as: (i) the ambiguity of terminology and the limited broad understanding of GI, and (ii) the absence of research produced in the continents of Asia and South America, as well as in regions with warmer climates, which are arguably equally valuable research locations as cooler climate bands.

AB  - Purpose Several freight operations rely on human cognition and behavior. Tackling these aspects, gamification transforms activities to resemble game-like experiences. Since the freight transportation sector is rapidly adopting gamification, the purpose of this study is to provide an overview that synthesizes the state-of-the-art and plot future directions for research and the practice of gamifying this area. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the gamification of freight transportation was conducted. After screening 691 studies, 40 relevant studies were analyzed. Findings Most studies found positive psychological and behavioral outcomes from gamification. Literature mainly focused on tackling the operational-level issues of road and maritime transportation modes by implementing simulation games. Research limitations/implications Besides elaborating how gamification can improve freight transportation, the authors describe directions still uncovered by the current corpus, such as research design and temporality and the variety of modes and tasks. Practical implications Practical implications emerged from the studies, primarily focusing on understanding users, tasks and contexts, targeting different audiences and transportation modalities, and balancing motivational affordances, while considering the demands of the freight transportation domain, including dynamic, spatially dispersed environments and cooperation between multiple stakeholders. Social implications The transportation of goods dominates much of the global economy and ecology. Therefore, gamifying this domain has a huge societal impact potential, especially related to issues of sharing economy, safety, environmental sustainability and social media. Originality/value Beyond providing an original overview of gamified freight transportation, this study maps current research gaps and describes practical recommendations.

AB  - BackgroundThe implementation of strategic health system change is often complicated by the informal politics and power of health systems, such as competing interests and resistant groups. Evidence from other industries shows that strategic leaders need to be aware of and manage such organisational politics' when implementing change, which involves developing and using forms of political skill', savvy' or astuteness'. The purpose of this study is to investigate the acquisition, use and contribution of political astuteness' in the implementation of strategic health system change.MethodsThe qualitative study comprises four linked work packages. First, we will complete a systematic review of reviews' on the topic of politicalskill and astuteness, and related social science concepts, which will be used to then review the existing health services research literature to identify exemplars of political astuteness in health care systems. Second, we will carry out semi-structured biographical interviews with regional and national service leaders, and recent recipients of leadership training, to understand their acquisition and use of political astuteness. Third, we will carry out in-depth ethnographic research looking at the utilisation and contribution of political astuteness in three contemporary examples of strategic health system change. Finally, we will explore and discuss the study findings through a series of co-production workshops to inform the development and testing of new learning resources and materials for future NHS leaders.DiscussionThe research will produce evidence about the relatively under-researched contribution that political skill and astuteness makes in the implementation of strategic health system change. It intends to offer new understanding of these skills and capabilities that takes greater account of the wider social, cultural organisational landscape, and offers tangible lessons and case examples for service leaders. The study will inform future learning materials and processes, and create spaces for future leaders to reflect upon their political astuteness in a constructive and development way.Trial registrationResearchregistery4020 [23rd April 2018].

AB  - Metal contamination of soils is widespread across Europe and is of great concern as it may impact food production, the supply of drinking water and human health (European Environment Agency, 2014; Panagos et al., 2013). Most re-search to date on soil metal contamination has focussed on agricultural soils (Tith et al., 2016a). Current knowledge of the extent of urban soil metal contamination in Europe, however, is limited, especially for soils in recreational areas, which is particularly concerning as these areas may have a high footfall. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of metal contamination in European urban soils based on 174 peer-reviewed studies spanning 143 urban sites and 29 European countries. The results show that reporting of data on urban soil metals is highly heterogeneous across the study area. Over half of all studies are from only five countries (Italy, Spain, UK, Poland and Serbia) and no data are available for 14 other European countries. The metals that most commonly exceed national safety thresholds are Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni. Elevated levels of these metals are usually attributed to anthropogenic sources, primarily traffic and industry. Some 22 % of urban sites studied show anthropogenic enrichment; this phenomenon is most common in Italy, Serbia and Finland. In contrast, 44 % of urban sites studied show geogenic metal enrichment; this is most com-mon in Italy, the UK and Serbia. The dataset is subject to a sample size bias, whereby soil metal enrichment is identified more frequently in regions with more data. Future studies should focus on key knowledge gaps, such as urban soils in locations with current or historical heavy industrialisation and locations in central and eastern Europe. Study methods should be standardised to facilitate comparison of soil metal data from different studies and European safety thresholds should be identified for key elements.

AB  - We reviewed 20 years of levels, sources, and environmental risks related to the main petroleum hydrocarbons in the northeast region of Brazil. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to serve as a comprehensive baseline for future monitoring programmes related to the oil spill disaster in 2019/2020. Most contamination levels of both PAHs and AHs were classified as low, except those in specific areas influenced by human activities, such as ports, highly urbanised mangroves, or rivers of medium-sized cities with inadequate liquid and solid waste treatment. Most hydrocarbons were linked to natural sources and burning processes, except in regions of extraction activities and petrochemical facilities as well as highly urbanised areas, where degraded petroleum and oil hydrocarbons predominated. Only 2.5% of the samples exceeded threshold effect levels for Sigma(16-PAHs) and no samples exceeded probable effect levels. When regional threshold levels were used, however, the probable effect for the Sigma(16-PAHs) measured was high, ranging from 5.8 to 6.1%. The few studies reporting biological responses showed that hydrocarbons from anthropogenic sources can induce adverse effects on marine organisms even at low to moderate levels. As the region has recently received a considerable quantity of crude oil, studies should be prioritised for a more precise assessment of the impact of this oil spill.

AB  - Efficient utilization of forestry, agriculture, and marine resources in various manufacturing sectors requires optimizing fiber transformation, dewatering, and drying energy consumption. These processes play a crucial role in reducing the carbon footprint and boosting sustainability within the circular bioeconomy framework. Despite efforts made in the paper industry to enhance productivity while conserving resources and energy through lower grammage and higher machine speeds, reducing thermal energy consumption during papermaking remains a significant challenge. A key approach to address this challenge lies in increasing dewatering of the fiber web before entering the dryer section of the paper machine. Similarly, the production of high-value-added products derived from alternative lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as nanocellulose and microalgae, requires advanced dewatering techniques for techno-economic viability. This critical and systematic review aims to comprehensively explore the intricate interactions between water and lignocellulosic surfaces, as well as the leading technologies used to enhance dewatering and drying. Recent developments in technologies to reduce water content during papermaking, and advanced dewatering techniques for nanocellulosic and microalgal feedstocks are addressed. Existing research highlights several fundamental and technical challenges spanning from the nano-to macroscopic scales that must be addressed to make lignocellulosics a suitable feedstock option for industry. By identifying alternative strategies to improve water removal, this review intends to accelerate the widespread adoption of lignocellulosics as feasible manufacturing feedstocks. Moreover, this review aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the interactions, associations, and bonding mechanisms between water and cellulose fibers, nanocellulosic materials, and microalgal feedstocks. The findings of this review shed light on critical research directions necessary for advancing the efficient utilization of lignocellulosic resources and accelerating the transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices.

AB  - Resilience thinking has undergone profound theoretical developments in recent decades, moving to characterize resilience as a socio-natural process that requires constant negotiation between a range of actors and institutions. Fundamental to this understanding has been a growing acknowledgment of the role of power in shaping resilience capacities and politics across cultural and geographic contexts. This review article draws on a critical content analysis, applied to a systematic review of recent resilience literature to examine how scholarship has embraced nuanced conceptualizations of how power operates in resilience efforts, to move away from framings that risk reinforcing patterns of marginalization. Advancing a framework inspired by feminist theory and feminist political ecology, we analyze how recent work has presented, documented, and conceptualized how resilience intersects with patterns of inequity. In doing so, we illuminate the importance of knowledge, scale, and subject-making in understanding the complex ways in which power and resilience become interlinked. We illustrate how overlooking such complexity may have serious consequences for how socio-natural challenges and solutions are framed in resilience scholarship and, in turn, how resilience is planned and enacted in practice. Finally, we highlight how recent scholarship is advancing the understandings necessary to make sense of the shifting, contested, and power-laden nature of resilience. Paying attention to, and building on, such complexity will allow scholarly work to illuminate the ways in which resilience is negotiated within inequitable processes and to address the marginalization of those continuing to bear the brunt of the climate crisis.

AB  - The whole world was shaken with the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in end of the year 2019. Due to its novel origin, it was required to follow all precautions possible. Dealing with the massive amount of infectious healthcare waste became an enormous challenge. This review identifies the impacts of the pandemic on biomedical waste management. This systematic review was made by using keywords "biomedical waste " and "COVID 19 " in open access databases like PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholers etc. 2124 articles downloaded and 765 found duplicate and 634 not related to the topic. after scrutiny with inclusion criteria 102 articles were considered to analyze the practices related to biomedical waste management during pandemic using PRISMA guideline.. The COVID-19 waste segregation, collection, storage, transportation, and disposal are a big challenge with all stakeholders. In order to control the virus spread, strict monitoring of the complete waste management cycle is required. Adoption of appropriate guidelines is paramount to worker safety and containment of infection. Sustainable recycling methods are needed to deal with the ever-increasing plastic waste resulting from mandatory personal protective equipment (PPE) usage. The situation also demands a rethinking of the healthcare system. Overall, there was an increase in BMW generation, and municipal waste had increased globally. Pandemic preparedness requires a global public health strategy and long-term investments. This will be vital for making a robust community capable enough to fight against any public health pressures in the future, as well as the pandemic tremors. Systematized efforts from all stakeholders, at all levels, not only refines epidemic preparation but also helps to attain a sustainable development of health for a healthier future.

AB  - Objective: Problematic prescription drug labeling has been cited as a root cause of patient misunderstanding, medication errors, and nonadherence. Although numerous studies have recently been conducted to identify and test labeling best practices, the last systematic review on this topic was conducted a decade ago. The objective of this review was, therefore, to examine, summarize, and update best practices for conveying written prescription medication information and instructions to patients. Data Sources: English-language articles published from June 2005 to June 2015 were identified in MEDLINE and CINAHL by searching the following text words: medication OR prescription OR drug' AND label OR leaflet OR brochure OR pamphlet OR medication guide OR medication insert OR drug insert OR medication information OR drug information OR instructions' AND patient OR consumer.' Reference mining and secondary searches were also performed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: A total of 31 articles providing evidence on how to improve written, prescription drug labeling for patient use were selected. Two reviewers independently screened articles, rated their quality, and abstracted data. Data Synthesis: Identified best practices included the use of plain language, improved formatting and organization, and more explicit instructions to improve patient comprehension. The use of icons had conflicting findings, and few studies tested whether practices improved knowledge or behaviors with patients' actual prescribed regimens. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to determine how specific modifications and improvements in drug labeling can enhance patient knowledge and behavior in actual use. Synthesizing best practices across all patient materials will create a more useful, coordinated system of prescription information.

AB  - Purpose The present study aims to conduct a systematic review of literature reporting on the dose and dosing schedule of dexamethasone (DXM) in relation to clinical outcomes in malignant brain tumor patients, with particular attention to evidence-based practice. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, Academic Search Premier, and PsycINFO to identify studies that reported edema volume reduction, symptomatic relief, adverse events and survival in relation to dexamethasone dose in glioma or brain metastasis (BM) patients. Results After screening 1812 studies, fifteen articles were included for qualitative review. Most studies reported a dose of 16 mg, mostly in a schedule of 4 mg four times a day. Due to heterogeneity of studies, it was not possible to perform quantitative meta-analysis. For BMs, best available evidence suggests that higher doses of DXM may give more adverse events, but may not necessarily result in better clinical condition. Some studies suggest that higher DXM doses are associated with shorter survival in the palliative setting. For glioma, DXM may lead to symptomatic improvement, yet no studies directly compare different doses. Results regarding edema reduction and survival in glioma patients are conflicting. Conclusions Evidence on the safety and efficacy of different DXM doses in malignant brain tumor patients is scarce and conflicting. Best available evidence suggests that low DXM doses may be noninferior to higher doses in certain circumstances, but more comparative research in this area is direly needed, especially in light of the increasing importance of immunotherapy for brain tumors.

AB  - Today's interconnected socio-economic and environmental challenges require the combination and reuse of existing integrated modelling solutions. This paper contributes to this overall research area, by reviewing a wide range of currently available frameworks, systems and emerging technologies for integrated modelling in the environmental sciences. Based on a systematic review of the literature, we group related studies and papers into viewpoints and elaborate on shared and diverging characteristics. Our analysis shows that component-based modelling frameworks and scientific workflow systems have been traditionally used for solving technical integration challenges, but ultimately, the appropriate framework or system strongly depends on the particular environmental phenomenon under investigation. The study also shows that - in general - individual integrated modelling solutions do not benefit from components and models that are provided by others. It is this island (or silo) situation, which results in low levels of model reuse for multi-disciplinary settings. This seems mainly due to the fact that the field as such is highly complex and diverse. A unique integrated modelling solution, which is capable of dealing with any environmental scenario, seems to be unaffordable because of the great variety of data formats, models, environmental phenomena, stakeholder networks, user perspectives and social aspects. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of modelling tools, which address complementary viewpoints - such as service-based combined with scientific workflow systems, or resource-modelling on top of virtual research environments - could lead to sustainable information systems, which would advance model sharing, reuse and integration. Next steps for improving this form of multi-disciplinary interoperability are sketched. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Bioenergy is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. The plant and fungal kingdoms offer great potential but remain mostly untapped. Their increased use could contribute to the renewable energy transition and addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." Current research focuses on species cultivated at scale in temperate regions, overlooking the wealth of potential new sources of small-scale energy where they are most urgently needed. A shift towards diversified, accessible bioenergy technologies will help to mitigate and adapt to the threats of climate change, decrease energy poverty, improve human health by reducing indoor pollution, increase energy resilience of communities, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.
   SummaryBioenergy derived from plants and fungi is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. There is rich untapped diversity in the plant and fungal kingdoms that offers potential to contribute to the shift away from fossil fuels and to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." Energy poverty-the lack of access to modern energy services-is most acute in the Global South where biodiversity is greatest and least investigated. Our systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years (2015-2020) indicates that research efforts have targeted a very small number of plant species cultivated at scale, mostly in temperate regions. The wealth of potential new sources of bioenergy in biodiverse regions, where the implementation of SDG7 is most urgently needed, has been largely overlooked. We recommend next steps for bioenergy stakeholders-research, industry, and government-to seize opportunities for innovation to alleviate energy poverty while protecting biodiversity. Small-scale energy production using native plant species in bioenergy landscapes overcomes many pitfalls associated with bioenergy crop monocultures, such as biodiversity loss and conflict with food production. Targeted trait-based screening of plant species and biological screening of fungi are required to characterize the potential of this resource. The benefits of diversified, accessible bioenergy go beyond the immediate urgency of energy poverty as more diverse agricultural landscapes are more resilient, store more carbon, and could also reduce the drivers of the climate and environmental emergencies.

AB  - Human land-use changes represent the most important drivers of biodiversity loss, and amphibians and reptiles represent the most threatened groups of vertebrates globally. However, today there is a general lack of knowledge and little consensus on how land-use changes affect amphibians and reptiles. In order to fill this gap, here we conduct the most comprehensive systematic quantitative review of primary research to date. By means of hierarchical meta-analyses we assessed the effects of the most common land-use changes (agriculture, cattle-raising, urbanization, deforestation, silviculture and selective logging) on the richness of amphibian and reptile communities. Our results show that almost all of the analyzed types of land-use changes have negative effects on these groups, but with different degree of magnitude. We also show that the time elapsed in disturbed conditions does not ameliorate the effects on species richness, indicating a low recovery capacity of herp communities. Another important finding is that the richest communities are the most negatively affected ones, varying the response according to the type of biome. Our synthesis provides updated empirical evidence indicating that current prevalent human land-use changes strongly reduce the richness of amphibian and reptile species as well as revealing important knowledge gaps in certain biomes of the world. These results should help providing a basis for the development of future research and contextualizing the need for effective conservation measures for these two vertebrate groups.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts have intensified by many folds and at different levels in recent years. The same is true in the case of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), the roof of the world, and a region known for its wealth in biodiversity. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) using the search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) framework; and for spatial and network analysis, we employed the VOSviewer software. The review-covering 240 peer-articles within a span of 27 years (from 1982 to 2019)-revealed that in the last decade, there was a 57% increase in publications but with a disproportionate geographical and thematic focus. About 82% of the research concentrated on protected areas and large carnivores and mega herbivores played a big role in such conflicts. About 53% of the studies were based on questionnaires, and the main driver reported was habitat disturbance of animals due to land-cover change, urbanization, and increase in human population. On the management front, the studies reported the use of traditional protection techniques like guarding and fencing. Our analysis of 681 keywords revealed a prominent focus on 'human-wildlife conflict,' 'Nepal,' 'Bhutan,' 'Snow Leopard,' and 'Leopard' indicating the issue linked with these species and countries. The involvement of 640 authors from 36 countries indicates increasing interest, and Nepal and India are playing key roles in the region. As for the spatial analysis that was conducted, while it showed regional variations, there were conspicuous limitations in terms of having a transboundary focus. Thus, particular attention ought to be paid to building transboundary partnerships and improving management interventions; there is also a pressing need to understand the patterns of human-wildlife convergence, especially involving meso-mammals.

AB  - Background: Circular economy (CE) has raised great interest as a concept and as a development model worldwide. This concept aims to provide a substitute for the linear economic model, which was based on production and consumption, continuous growth, and resources depletion. CE allows a greener economy with sustainable development and promotes more balanced societies. The healthcare sector is a major contributor to the climate crisis, with a carbon footprint representing 4.4% of global net emissions. It is thus essential to rethink the applicability of CE in healthcare. Methods: We conducted a scoping review guided by the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework and utilised PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. A systematic search from MEDLINE complete, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases published between 1992 and 2022. Results: Through database searching a total of 1018 records were identified and 475 duplicates were removed. From the total search, 543 articles were screened by title/abstract according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After screening, 38 full-text articles were selected and assessed for eligibility. Forty-seven additional records were also identified through other sources and screened for eligibility. Other sources included: 12 articles from snowballing of previous papers; 9 articles following peer-reviewers suggestions; 19 reports from relevant organisations in CE and healthcare; two webpage, and one book. Conclusion: Specific areas were identified where hospitals could reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consequently their negative environmental impact, namely through waste management, energy, water, transportation/travel, hospital design, food optimisation, green procurement, and behaviour. Also, lack of staff awareness and knowledge of the environmental impact of healthcare, and hospitals sustainability were identified as major contributors.

AB  - Green retrofit in existing buildings is of great significance in achieving a sustainable environment. Various policies have been introduced around the world to promote building green retrofit, whereas the uptake is rare for policy ineffectiveness. To improve policy effectiveness, it has been emphasized that a systematic review of existing retrofit policies has a key priority. In this study, a comprehensive review on retrofit policies in China was conducted because there are great application potential for green retrofit in China's existing buildings. This study examined the state-of-the-art development of retrofit policies during 1996-2019 and explored policy characteristics based on content analysis. The ambitious retrofit objectives and multiple retrofit instruments were identified. The relevant policy instruments can be grouped into six categories, including command and control, economic incentives, technology, information, certification, organization & professional. The most cited policy was the command and control instrument, followed by the certification-based instrument. Moreover, policy instruments related to economic incentives, technology and information were also valued by the China government, while the government attempted to reduce the adoption of economic incentives and technology measures since 2010. In addition, organization & professional instruments are largely ignored in China. In the light of these findings, a roadmap was proposed to enhance the effectiveness of building retrofit policies. This study sheds lights on the effectiveness of China's building policies to accelerate the popularity of green retrofit, and provides valuable references for other countries and regions to shape their own policy pathways towards the large-scale promotion of building green retrofit.

AB  - The discourse surrounding sustainability, particularly in the urban environment, has gained considerable momentum in recent years. The concept of a smart city epitomises the integration of innovative technological solutions with community-centred approaches, thereby laying the groundwork for a sustainable lifestyle. One of the crucial components of this integration is the effective and innovative management of waste. The aim of this article was to classify scientific research pertaining to waste management within the context of smart city issues, and to identify emerging directions for future research. A systematic literature review, based on a bibliometric analysis of articles included in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, was conducted for this study. The purpose of such a systematic review is to identify, integrate, and evaluate research on a selected topic, using clearly defined criteria. The research query included: TITLE-ABS-KEY ("smart city" AND (waste OR garbage OR trash OR rubbish)) in the case of Scopus, and TS = ("smart city" AND (waste OR garbage OR trash OR rubbish)) in the case of the Web of Science database. A total of 1768 publication records qualified for the analysis. This study presents an investigation into the current and forthcoming directions of waste management in smart cities, synthesising the latest advancements and methods. The findings outline specific future research directions encompassing technological advancement, special waste challenges, digitisation, energy recovery, transportation, community engagement, policy development, security, novel frameworks, economic and environmental impact assessment, and global implications. These insights reflect a multifaceted approach, advocating a technology-driven perspective that is integral to urban sustainability and quality of life. The study's findings provide practical avenues for cities to enhance waste management through modern technologies, promoting efficient systems and contributing to sustainable urban living and the circular economy. The insights are vital for policymakers and industry leaders globally, supporting the creation of universal standards and policies, thereby fostering comprehensive waste management systems aligned with global sustainability objectives.

AB  - Despite the plethora of explications of the direct and indirect impacts of green people management practices on different dimensions of individual and organizational performance and sustainability, a holistic model demonstrating the constituent aspects and impacts of such sustainability on organizational, individual, and team performance is missing. The objective of this study is to address this gap/void through a review of 127 papers on green human resource management (GHRM) following a systematic literature review approach. Based on the systematic review, this study used a thematic analysis, which identified twenty-four disparate people and organizational aspects and grouped the most used ones into five theoretical lenses, including AMO = ability-motivation-opportunity, RBV = resource-based view, SHT = stakeholder theory, SET =social exchange theory, and SIT = social identity theory. These five sets of results were used to develop the first-of-its-kind holistic framework showing how GHRM works in a cyclical process to fill the missing gap in how to sustainably improve individual, group, and organizational performance for multiple organizational stakeholders. Second, this article contributes theoretically to the social engagement and social identity theories, thereby extending Deci and Ryan's organismic integration and self-determination theories to show how GHRM practices can be implemented for sustainable organizational performance. Third, this study also proposed a new and more sustainable bottom line for business organizations seeking to improve their performance, and this contribution is referred to as sustainable GHRM-organizational performance (SGHRM-OrgP). Finally, this study proposes a research agenda highlighting where more research areas are needed. Despite the potential that such a model offers for organizational sustainability, the authors recognize the next research step of applying its constituent parts in practically optimizing performance.

AB  - Circular economy is a sustainable economic development model. It replaces the traditional economic development model that relies heavily on resource consumption and waste generation. Circular economy is particularly important to the waste electrical and electronic equipment industry as e-waste contains toxic substances and precious metals. While previous review studies focused on specific aspects of the WEEE industry (e.g., "4R" circular economy strategies), these studies offer little details on how circular economy practices affect the development of the environment and economy in the waste electrical and electronic equipment industry. This study examines "10R" circular economy strategies to advance knowledge of the existing literature that focuses on "4R" circular economy strategies. To improve the methodology used in the previous review studies that apply subjective methods (e.g., content analysis), this paper conducts a systematic literature review on 208 studies and uses citation network analysis to examine specific circular economy practices in the waste electrical and electronic equipment industry. The citation network analysis identified five major research domains (i.e., "e-waste management systems and practices", "e-waste legislation and its components", "extended producer responsibility schemes", "recycling critical materials from e-waste", "circular economy strategies for the waste electrical and electronic equipment industry"). Based on these results, this study conducts a main path analysis to reveal ten major topics (i.e., e-waste recycling system; exploring untapped e-waste; compliance assurance of stakeholders; e-waste reverse logistics; reward and punishment mechanisms in extended producer responsibility system; verifying the rationality of product classification; recycling critical materials from urban mines; setting a specific target for preparation for reuse; "10R" strategies applied in the smart factory; consumer attitude toward remanufactured/refurbished/repurposed strategies and the resultant products) in the identified research domain. Finally, this paper proposes future research directions and provides managerial and policy implications for researchers and practitioners.

AB  - Adopting climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices is a long-term solution for enhancing agricultural sustainability and food security under the changing climate. However, the penetration rate of CSA practices remains low worldwide. Understanding the key factors driving the adoption of CSA practices is key to increasing its penetration. This study provides a systematic review of the literature comprising 190 studies published between 2013 and 2023. Based on the reviewed literature, we provide comprehensive definitions of CSA practices from broad and narrow perspectives. We also discuss the factors influencing farmers' decisions to adopt CSA practices from four categories: socio-demographic factors, institutional factors, resource endowment factors, and socio-economic factors. Our literature review reveals that most of the factors (e.g., age, gender, education, risk perception and preference, access to credit, farm size, production conditions, off-farm income, and labor allocation) discussed in the literature have a dual (either positive or negative) impact on CSA practice adoption. The variables such as labor endowment, land tenure security, access to extension services, access to agricultural training, membership in farmers' organizations, non-governmental organization (NGO) support, climate conditions, and access to information consistently and positively impact CSA practice adoption. These findings provide solid evidence for designing appropriate policy instruments that help accelerate CSA diffusion and transmission. We also find gaps in CSA practice measurements, influencing factor identification, and econometric methods used for empirical analysis, which should be explored by future research.

AB  - The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) and domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) occur across the United States, violating the rights and health of far too many children and youth. Adequate prevention efforts should seek to understand the factors that make minors vulnerable to sexual exploitation in order to properly design programs to prevent victimization. This review presents the identified risk factors collected via a systematic literature review. Following full-text review, 15 studies were selected for inclusion by meeting the following criteria: original quantitative or qualitative research studies published in English from January 2010 to September 2017 with titles or abstracts that indicated a focus on the risk factors, vulnerabilities, or statistics of CSEC/DMST and a domestic focus on CSEC/DMST (for U.S.-based journals) with findings that did not combine associations between minors and adults in the study. Relevant risk factors and vulnerabilities found in this review include child abuse and maltreatment, caregiver strain, running away or being thrown away, substance use, peer influence, witnessing family violence or criminality, poverty or material need, difficulty in school, conflict with parents, poor mental health or view of self, involvement in child protective services, involvement in juvenile detention or delinquency, early substance use, and prior rape or adolescent sexual victimization.

AB  - Multiple stressors are ubiquitous in coastal ecosystems as a result of increased human activity and development along coastlines. Accurately assessing multiple stressor effects is essential for predicting stressor impacts and informing management to efficiently and effectively mitigate potentially complex ecological responses. Extracting relevant information on multiple stressor studies conducted specifically within coastal wetlands is not possible from existing reviews, posing challenges in highlighting knowledge gaps and guiding future research. Here, we systematically review manipulative studies that assess multiple anthropogenic stressors within saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass ecosystems. In the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in publications, with seagrasses receiving the most attention (76 out of a total of 143 studies). Across all studies, nutrient loading and temperature were tested most often (N = 64 and N = 48, respectively), while the most common stressor combination was temperature with salinity (N = 12). Stressor application and study design varied across ecosystems. Studies are mostly conducted in highly controlled environments, without considering how natural variations in the physicochemical environment of coastal ecosystems may influence stressor intensity and timing under these conditions. This may result in vastly different ecological responses across levels of biological organisation. Shifting focus from univariate analytical approaches to multivariate, particularly path analysis, will help elucidate complex ecological relationships and highlight direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors in coastal ecosystems. There is a solid foundation of multiple stressor research in coastal wetlands. However, we recommend future research enhance ecological realism in experimental design by studying the effects of stressor combinations whilst accounting for spatiotemporal variability that reflects natural conditions of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - At any given time the two rival organizational values cooperation and competition coexist in any team and/or organization in different intensities and mix, depending on both internal factors (e.g., culture, task dimensions of accuracy and speed) and external factors (e.g., market and competitive forces). However, determining that desirable intensity and mix of these two values seems to be a challenging task in the current literature and no explicit method currently exists for measuring factors that may lead to determination of such desirable mix. Considering the crucial impacts of these values on organizational behaviours, this in turn may result in loss of efficiency and productivity in organizations. In this study a systematic review of current literatures in the areas of knowledge management, social psychology, organizational studies and Computer-Supported Cooperative Systems (CSCW) studies, is used to uncover a research theme for analysing the impacts of the two rival organizational values competition and cooperation on knowledge sharing behaviours through promotive interaction between individuals. Supporting the IT-culture conflict theory, this study is considered as a research theme which investigates the impact of culture on IT application and use. More specifically, by combining the goal interdependency theory of conflict, social learning theory, the internal organizational forces of competition and cooperation and the awareness net analysis, the present study deeply investigate the term tension between cooperative and competitive values and their impact on organizational behaviours. It then introduces factors that can assist in finding an optimal mix of the cooperative and competitive values in organizations at any given time. The present study also relates the above optimal mix/tension with the organization's reward structure, the task dimensions of 'speed' and 'accuracy', group characteristics and organizational climate in order to draw inferences for attaining an optimal level of process awareness for individuals while performing their tasks within an organization.

AB  - Basic values are the core element of culture, explaining many important differences in social, economic and political effects. Yet the nature and the composition of cultural value systems remains highly debatable. An emerging field of cultural neuroscience promises to shed light on how societies differ in their value systems and on the low-level mechanisms through which they operate. A systematic review of 47 experimental studies using different brain research methods is conducted to identify neural systems and processes, which can be associated with specific values, irrespective of interpretations given by the authors of original studies. Key findings were extracted and systematized according to Hofstede's and some other (Trompenaars' and Gelfand's) models of national cultures. From the perspective of existing accounts of cultural value systems, existing literature provides only a very fragmented and biased view of the neural processing of values. Absolute majority of existing evidence (37 studies) of cultural differences in the brain functions can be associated with individualism-collectivism value dimension. Affectivity-Neutrality is identified in 11 studies, Tightness-Looseness - 6, Power Distance - 3; Indulgence, Long-Term Orientation and Universalism - 2, and Uncertainty Avoidance - 1. Other value dimensions from the applied models of culture are not represented at all. Key problems limiting the contribution of the contemporary culture neuroscience to the comparative studies of cultural values include: researchers' theoretical framing within the independence-interdependence paradigm, resulting in the loss of a broader perspective and alternative interpretations of findings, the lack of focus on the direct comparison of values and value dimensions, insufficiently representative and biased samples.

AB  - One of the main objectives of Foode, European research project, is to identify sustainable initiatives of City region Food System (CRFS) and to characterize indicators of their replicability. With economic, sanitary and environmental crises the consumers ask more sustainable CRFS. This communication will present a part of the FOODE results, especially a systematic literature on the different innovative business models (BMs) applied in bioeconomy sector. The BM CANVAS, based on the relation between profit and innovation, explains how the initiative creates, delivers, shares value. The triple layered BM canvas adds social and environmental dimensions to the economic impact and shows how the organization creates social and environmental positive impacts. So, this review of innovative bioeconomy BMs allows the characterization of criteria of environmental, social and economic KPI (key performance indicator) to enhance sustainable CRFS and to propose viable strategy of their development and duplication. The review is conducted using the PRISMA methodology (Moheret et al., 2009) to collect scientific contributions on the food bioeconomy and innovative and sustainable BMs applied to the CRFS approach. First, this communication highlights the relevant topics of the food bioeconomy and their underlying business models, namely for urban and peri-urban agriculture, Alternative Food Networks, technological innovations (plant breeding, building-integrated rooftop greenhouses, vertical farming, aquaponics, smart farming, product innovations, and food waste valorization). Secondly, sustainable and innovative BM of the Foode pilot initiatives are presented.

AB  - The rise in global human population, coupled with the effects of climate change, has increased the demand for arable land. Soil fertility has been the most affected, among other things. Many approaches to soil fertility management have been proposed by studies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); however, the question of sustainability remains. Nutrient monitoring (NUTMON), which combines biophysical and socio-economic features for soil fertility management, gives an in-situ soil fertility status of a given land use system, which ultimately provides guidance in proposing appropriate soil management techniques in a given land use system. In this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach was deployed for a systematic search of the literature materials. The review evaluated various studies on nutrient monitoring in SSA soils in order to understand the socioeconomic attributes and their influence on farming systems, as well as nutrient flow and balances. The review identified two dominant smallholder farming systems in SSA: mixed crop-livestock and mixed crop farming systems. Also, this review revealed that most nutrient balance studies in SSA have been done in mixed crop and livestock farming systems. However, regardless of the farming systems, the overall mean nutrient balances in all studies, particularly those of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), were negative, indicating significant nutrient mining. The review further revealed a vast range of biophysical soil fertility management technologies; however, their adoption has been limited by socio-economic aspects including land ownership, gender, financial position, literacy level, and access to inputs. Therefore, in view of this situation, integrating biophysical and socioeconomic disciplines could address the problem of soil nutrient depletion holistically, thus decreasing the existing negative nutrient balances in the SSA region.

AB  - Increa sing demand for water coupled with reduced water availability in many regions of the world is leading to growing water scarcity and calls for implementation of a range of technological, institutional, and economic solutions. Water-economy models (WEMs), which integrate the complex interrelationships between hydrologic and economic systems, are effective tools for analyzing these issues and for providing appropriate solutions across varied spatial and temporal scales. These models can be powerful tools for examining potential future changes in water resources systems, including the effects of climate change, socioeconomic changes, and infrastructural and policy responses to water resource management challenges. In this paper, the WEM models used to answer water economy questions are classified into two general categories on the basis of their structure: network-based (simulation or optimization) hydroeconomic models, and economywide (input-output or computable general equilibrium) models. This paper highlights the primary differences in the applications and interpretations obtained using these approaches, analyzes the distribution of questions that different WEMs have been used to answer, and discusses previous work and efforts to integrate across model types. Findings suggest that additional efforts are needed to more realistically account for the range and complexity of linking water systems and society, particularly regarding ecology and water quality, and the food and energy sectors. Additionally, the broader economic impacts of water-related processes, for example those related to interregional trade dynamics, the distribution of income, and migration, should be investigated further. In effect, because of the inherent complexity in the economic dynamics underlying many water systems, such tools can challenge intuition and provide critical insights that are relevant to more effective management of transboundary water resources and related sectors.

AB  - A transition toward environmentally conscious business practices is underway in many sectors. For healthcare, the topic is both concerning and tragically ironic as hospitals have substantial environmental footprints, which are now known to contribute to significant health problems that the system itself was designed to treat. The human medical field has been proactive in taking steps to reduce waste and carbon emissions by identifying best practices to minimize such impacts. Characterization of needs and gaps has been addressed through reviews of the literature regarding environmental sustainability in the context of human hospitals. Our objective was to replicate methods used in a recent review of environmental sustainability in human hospitals to summarize information available to clinical veterinarians. Two search algorithms were used across 8 databases, however only 3 peer-reviewed opinion articles specific to veterinary medicine were identified. These papers included 1 on anesthesia and 2 on production animals. Interestingly, all articles were written by United Kingdom-based authors and none were specific to companion animal practice, the largest sector in the veterinary industry in the United States. Results of this review highlight need for research and communication that supports veterinary clinics in adopting more environmentally sustainable practices. Proposed starting points informed from research in other sectors, including 5 physical themes of energy efficiency, water, waste, sustainable procurement, and transportation, and human behavior changes on the individual, group, and organizational levels, are discussed. Additional work is needed to support veterinarians and other animal health professionals to practice medicine in a way that upholds the veterinary profession's oath to promote the health of animals, the public, and the environment we all share.

AB  - A systematic review of previous mobile payment studies revealed that studies mainly focused on consumer adoptions via conducting surveys, yet the low adoption of mobile payment services still exists. Despite a number of studies investigated barriers to mobile payment consumer adoptions, little explanation has been provided without taking ecosystem factors of mobile payment into account. Given the promising future of digital payments, we believe it is more relevant to study the actual usage of e-wallets via a novel approach. The objective of the study is to identify and categorize related themes of usages of e-wallets using big data analytics. With a large dataset of 18,149 user posts extracted from social media platforms, we apply the text mining method to analyze e-wallet users' behaviors. Our major findings are (i) whilst contradicting with user adoption factors (e.g., usefulness), users are attracted to use e-wallets to gain cashback and accumulate reward points; (ii) successful measures for e-wallet business models include a user-friendly interface, promotional campaigns, and customer service with real-time problem-solving; (iii) an intense competition between bank e-wallets and third party ewallets is compounded with stricter government regulations; (iv) low rates of merchant adoption contribute to the lack of critical mass use of e-wallets. The big data analytics of actual usage of e-wallets produce more relevant and accurate understandings of the mobile payment mechanism. It reflects the complexity of human-computer interactions. This study establishes a predictive model of measuring successful e-wallet business and provides a holistic view of the mobile payment ecosystem with empirical evidence. The business must go beyond consumer adoption, learn actual user behavior, and take consumers' pulse to achieve a sustainable business model. It is suggested that governments reform and upgrade the monitoring framework to accommodate the development of payment systems.

AB  - Classification of tree species provides important data in forest monitoring, sustainable forest management and planning. The recent developments in Multi Spectral (MS) and Hyper Spectral (HS) Imaging sensors in remote sensing have made the detection of tree species easier and accurate. With this systematic review study, it is aimed to understand the contribution of using the Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral Imaging data in the detection of tree species while highlighting recent advances in the field and emphasizing important directions together with new possibilities for future inquiries. In this review, researchers and decision makers will be informed in two different subjects: First one is about the processing steps of exploiting Multi Spectral and HS images and the second one is about determining the advantages of exploiting Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral images in the application area of detecting tree species. In this way exploiting satellite data will be facilitated. This will also provide an economical gain for using commercial Multi Spectral and Hyper Spectral Imaging data. Moreover, it should be also kept in mind that, as the number of spectral tags that will be obtained from each tree type are different, both the processing method and the classification method will change accordingly. This review, studies were grouped according to the data exploited (only Hyper Spectral images, only Multi Spectral images and their combinations), type of tree monitored and the processing method used. Then, the contribution of the image data used in the study was evaluated according to the accuracy of classification, the suitable type of tree and the classification method.

AB  - In the operations management and sustainability literature, the integration of Lean and Green manufacturing is considered one of the great solutions to balancing operational gains and environmental sustainability. This literature focuses mainly on the integration between them. However, there are no studies investigating how this integration is related to the Operations Strategy content: competitive priorities and decision areas. Thus, this study aims to contribute to reducing this research gap by providing a more in-depth understanding of the relationships between Lean-Green practices from the point of view of the Operations Strategy. We identify synergies and potential trade-offs between competitive priorities and changes in decision areas when Lean-Green practices are implemented. We performed a systematic literature review to answer two questions: Does the implementation of Lean and Green practices affect operations' competitive priorities, causing synergies or trade-offs? What decision area(s) are modified with the implementation of each practice? This systematic review analyzed 338 selected articles. Competitive priorities, decision areas, Lean practices, Green practices and Lean-Green practices were identified and discussed, highlighting trade-offs, synergies and changes in decision areas. The results suggest that Lean and Green are synergistic in most practices, but they must be managed according to the Operations Strategy, especially as their focuses are essentially different and trade-offs may occur.

AB  - Background: Research priority setting with stakeholders can help direct the limited resources for health research toward priority areas of need. Ensuring transparency of the priority setting process can strengthen legitimacy and credibility for influencing the research agenda. This study aims to develop a reporting guideline for priority setting of health research.
   Methods: We searched electronic databases and relevant websites for sources (frameworks, guidelines, or models for conducting, appraising, reporting or evaluating health research priority setting, and reviews (including systematic reviews)), and primary studies of research priority setting to July 2019. We inductively developed a list of reporting items and piloted the preliminary guideline with a diverse range of 30 priority setting studies from the records retrieved.
   Results: From 21,556 records, we included 26 sources for the candidate REPRISE framework and 455 primary research studies. The REporting guideline for PRIority SEtting of health research (REPRISE) has 31 reporting items that cover 10 domains: context and scope, governance and team, framework for priority setting, stakeholders/participants, identification and collection of priorities, prioritization of research topics, output, evaluation and feedback, translation and implementation, and funding and conflict of interest. Each reporting item includes a descriptor and examples.
   Conclusions: The REPRISE guideline can facilitate comprehensive reporting of studies of research priority setting. Improved transparency in research priority setting may strengthen the acceptability and implementation of the research priorities identified, so that efforts and funding are invested in generating evidence that is of importance to all stakeholders.

AB  - The circular bioeconomy (CBE) is an increasingly popular method used to add value to bio-based products. However, these products entail impacts on sustainability that can be assessed by life cycle thinking (LCT). Therefore, this manuscript aims to describe the current development of using LCT for a CBE and to identify challenges and future perspectives with regard to this topic. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), analyzing a final portfolio of 57 documents. The results indicated that the use of LCT for a CBE is very recent and has been increasing over the years, is concentrated in Europe, and mainly assesses the conversion of biowastes in biofuels through biorefinery processes, considering mostly environmental concerns, by applying life cycle assessment; thus neglecting economic and social issues. The use of system boundaries, software, databases, and impact assessment methods was reviewed. Five challenges were revealed (the expansion of system boundaries, the consideration of more endpoints, the development and use of regional databases, the development of policies to encourage CBE, and the addition of economic and social issues. Future perspectives will be aimed at considering microalgae, wastewater, and animal biomass in CBE processes, developing more value-added bioproducts and biofuels, and adding cost assessment and more circularity to CBE processes.

AB  - The family Mustelidae is the largest among the order Carnivora. While we know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of information about many mustelids. We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as "the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon". We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.
   METHODS: The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.
   RESULTS: Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

AB  - BackgroundAddressing childhood stunting is a priority and an important step in the attainment of Global Nutrition Targets for 2025 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Rwanda, the prevalence of child stunting remains high despite concerted efforts to reduce it.MethodsUtilizing the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) framework on maternal and child nutrition, this study systematically evaluated the determinants of child stunting in Rwanda and identified available gaps. Twenty-five peer-reviewed papers and five Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) reports were included in the final selection of our review, which allowed us to identify determinants such as governance and norms including wealth index, marital status, and maternal education, while underlying determinants were maternal health and nutrition factors, early initiation of breastfeeding, water treatment and sanitation, and immediate factors included infections.ResultsA total of 75% of the overall inequality in stunting was due to the difference in the social determinants of stunting between poor and nonpoor households. Maternal education (17%) and intergenerational transfer (31%) accounted for most of the inequalities in stunting, and an increase in gross domestic product per capita contributed to a reduction in its prevalence. There is a paucity of information on the impact of sociocultural norms, early life exposures, maternal health and nutrition, and Rwandan topography.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that improving women's status, particularly maternal education and health; access to improved water, sanitation, and hygiene-related factors; and the socioeconomic status of communities, especially those in rural areas, will lay a sound foundation for reducing stunting among under-5 children.

AB  - With the continuous rise of food waste (FW) throughout the world, a research effort to reveal its potential for bioenergy production is surging. There is a lack of harmonized information and publications available that evaluate the state-of-advance for FW-derived methane production process, particularly from an engineering and sustainability point of view. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has shown remarkable efficiency in the bioconversion of FW to methane. This paper reviews the current research progress, gaps, and prospects in pre-AD, AD, and postAD processes of FW-derived methane production. Briefly, the review highlights innovative FW collection and optimization routes such as AI that enable efficient FW valorization processes. As weather changes and the FW sources may affect the AD efficiency, it is important to assess the spatio-seasonal variations and microphysical properties of the FW to be valorized. In that case, developing weather-resistant bioreactors and cost-effective mechanisms to modify the raw substrate morphology is necessary. An AI-guided reactor could have high performance when the internal environment of the centralized operation is monitored in real-time and not susceptible to changes in FW variety. Monitoring solvent degradation and fugitive gases during biogas purification is a challenging task, especially for large-scale plants. Furthermore, this review links scientific evidence in the field with full-scale case studies from different countries. It also highlights the potential contribution of ADFW to carbon neutrality efforts. Regarding future research needs, in addition to the smart collection scheme, attention should be paid to the management and utilization of FW impurities, to ensure sustainable AD operations.

AB  - Lipid microdomains ("rafts") are dynamic, nanoscale regions of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, that possess distinctive physicochemical properties including higher order than the surrounding membrane. Lipid microdomain integrity is thought to affect neurotransmitter signaling by regulating membrane-bound protein signaling. Among the proteins potentially affected are monoaminergic receptors and transporters. As dysfunction of monoaminergic neurotransmission is implicated in major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions, interactions with lipid microdomains may be of clinical importance. This systematic review evaluates what is known about the molecular relationships of monoamine transporter and receptor regulation to lipid microdomains. The PubMed/ MeSH database was searched for original studies published in English through August 2017 concerning relationships between lipid microdomains and serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and receptors. Fifty-seven publications were identified and assessed. Strong evidence implicates lipid microdomains in the regulation of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters; serotonin 1A, 2A, 3A, and 7A receptors; and dopamine D1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors. Results were conflicting or more complex regarding lipid microdomain associations with the dopamine transporter, D2, D3, and D5 receptors; and negative with respect to beta 1 adrenergic receptors. Indirect evidence suggests that antidepressants, lipid-lowering drugs, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may exert effects on depression and suicide by altering the lipid milieu, thereby affecting monoaminergic transporter and receptor signaling. The lipid composition of membrane subdomains is involved in localization and trafficking of specific monoaminergic receptors and transporters. Elucidating precise mechanisms whereby lipid microdomains modulate monoamine neurotransmission in clinical contexts can have critical implications for pharmacotherapeutic targeting.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in the UK. Tamoxifen (TAM) is considered as the standard of care for many women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, wide variability in the response of individuals to drugs at the same doses may occur, which may be a result of interindividual genetic differences (pharmacogenetics). TAM is known to be metabolised to its active metabolites N-desmethyl TAM and 4-hydroxytamoxifen by a number of CYP450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethyl TAM is further metabolised to endoxifen by CYP2D6. Endoxifen, which is also formed via the action of CYP2D6, is 30- to 100-fold more potent than TAM in suppressing oestrogen-dependent cell proliferation, and is considered an entity responsible for significant pharmacological effects of TAM. Thus, an association between the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype and phenotype (expected drug effects) is believed to exist and it has been postulated that CYP2D6 testing may play a role in optimising an individual's adjuvant hormonal treatment.
   Objectives: To determine whether or not testing for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) polymorphisms in women with early hormone receptor positive breast cancer leads to improvement in outcomes, is useful for health decision-making and is a cost-effective use of health-care resources.
   Data sources: Relevant electronic databases and websites including MEDLINE, EMBASE and HuGENet (TM) [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Office of Public Health Genomics), Human Genome Epidemiology Network] were searched until July 2009. Further studies that became known to the authors via relevant conferences or e-mail alerts from an automatically updated search of the Scopus database were also included as the review progressed, up to March 2010.
   Review methods: A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6 testing was undertaken. As it was not possible to conduct meta-analyses, data were extracted into structured tables and narratively discussed. An exploratory analysis of sensitivity and specificity was undertaken. A review of economic evaluations and models of CYP2D6 testing for patients treated with TAM was also carried out.
   Results: A total of 25 cohorts were identified which examined clinical efficacy (overall survival and relapse/recurrence), adverse events and endoxifen plasma concentrations by genotype/phenotype. Significantly, six cohorts suggest extensive metabolisers (Ems) appear to have better outcomes than either poor metabolisers (PMs) or PMs + intermediate metabolisers in terms of relapse/recurrence; however, three cohorts report apparently poorer outcomes for EMs (albeit not statistically significant). There was heterogeneity across the studies in terms of the patient population, alleles tested and outcomes used and defined. One decision model proposing a strategy for CYP2D6 testing for TAM was identified, but this was not suitable for developing a model to examine the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6 testing. It was not possible to produce a de novo model because of a lack of data to populate it.
   Conclusion: This is a relatively new area of research that is evolving rapidly and, although international consortia are collaborating, the data are limited and conflicting. Therefore, it is not possible to recommend pharmacogenetic testing in this patient population. Future research needs to focus on which alleles (including, or in addition to, those related to CYP2D6) reflect patient response, the link between endoxifen levels and clinical outcomes, and the appropriate pathways for implementation of such pharmacogenetic testing in patient care pathways.

AB  - The global sustainability development mission of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is easy to suggest, but incredibly difficult to put into action. Fortunately, continuing reliance on green conversion technologies could effectively address business concerns of energy expenditures, ecological pollution, and fossil fuel depletion. To promote sustainable practices, many researchers and practitioners have put their hopes in the environment -friendly use of biomass. Biomass supply chain management, which contributes to saving the planet, societies, and costs, has a high potential for sustainable development. Besides, successful implementation of regulatory policies that incorporate tax and incentive strategies into decision-making processes has shifted biomass busi-nesses toward greener practices. To this end, quantitative analytics propose primary tools in developing sustainability-driven decisions for biomass supply chains. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive clas-sification of methodologies applied in this field which incorporate the role of policy mechanisms into managerial decisions. The current study conducts a systematic review of 450 peer-reviewed papers, where we apply a rule -governed content analysis approach that includes collecting, filtering, and categorizing the prior research in a reproducible manner. We also classify the collected materials using deductive and inductive approaches to determine various structural dimensions and associated analytic categories. In the context of biomass supply chain management, we provide evidence that energy crops and forest-based biomass are the most addressed biomass feedstock types in the existing literature, while municipal solid waste sources could be explored further in future research. Additionally, from a sustainability development perspective we show that the environmental pillar has attracted much more attention than the social aspect that accounts for job creation, safe workplace, food security, and consumer surplus.

AB  - The analysis of innovations and technologies aimed at improving the sustainability of mining activity has become important in recent decades. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the dynamics of this line of research worldwide between 1998 and 2017. A bibliometric analysis and a systematic review of a sample of 2,562 articles was developed along with an analytical framework based on the mine life cycle and the three areas of sustainability (economic, social and environmental). The results show that sustainability research has grown at a much higher rate than that of mining and minerals research. The three journals that have published the most articles on this line of research are Journal of Cleaner Production, Environmental Science and Technology, and Gornyi Zhurnal, and the three countries with the highest number of published articles are the USA, China, and Germany. Some 60.9%, 30.9%, and 8.2% of the analysed mining innovations impact environmental, economic, and social sustainability, respectively, and some 7.1% affect the exploration phase, 84.8% the exploitation phase, and 8.1% the closure phase. The analysis of issues related to environmental sustainability becomes more relevant as the exploration phase moves on to exploitation and closure. The primary challenges and future lines of research are in reducing energy use and increasing the use of renewable sources, analysing the social sustainability of current mining activities, and achieving clean production in the development of new mining activity environments (ice-covered areas and the ocean floor). This work provides new perspectives on the analysis and integral assessment of innovations and technologies aimed at making mining activity more sustainable, particularly where the contributions to the environmental, economic, and social fields are valued.

AB  - For aiming to keep global warming well-below 2 degrees C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C, as set out in the Paris Agreement, a full-fledged assessment of negative emission technologies (NETs) that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is crucial to inform science-based policy making. With the Paris Agreement in mind, we re-analyse available scenario evidence to understand the roles of NETs in 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C scenarios and, for the first time, link this to a systematic review of findings in the underlying literature. In line with previous research, we find that keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C requires a rapid large-scale deployment of NETs, while for 2 degrees C, we can still limit NET deployment substantially by ratcheting up near-term mitigation ambition. Most recent evidence stresses the importance of future socio-economic conditions in determining the flexibility of NET deployment and suggests opportunities for hedging technology risks by adopting portfolios of NETs. Importantly, our thematic review highlights that there is a much richer set of findings on NETs than commonly reflected upon both in scientific assessments and available reviews. In particular, beyond the common findings on NETs underpinned by dozens of studies around early scale-up, the changing shape of net emission pathways or greater flexibility in the timing of climate policies, there is a suite of "niche and emerging findings", e.g. around innovation needs and rapid technological change, termination of NETs at the end of the twenty-first century or the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of NETs that have not been widely appreciated. Future research needs to explore the role of climate damages on NET uptake, better understand the geophysical constraints of NET deployment (e.g. water, geological storage, climate feedbacks), and provide a more systematic assessment of NET portfolios in the context of sustainable development goals.

AB  - Introduction Conflicting evidence exists on whether physical activity (PA) levels of humans have changed over the last quarter-century. The main objective of this study was to determine if there is evidence of time trends in PA, from cross-sectional studies that assessed PA at different time points using wearable devices (e.g., pedometers and accelerometers). A secondary objective was to quantify the rate of change in PA. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted of English-language studies indexed in PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science (1960-2020) using search terms (time OR temporal OR secular) AND trends AND (steps per day OR pedometer OR accelerometer OR MVPA). Subsequently, a meta-analytic approach was used to aggregate data from multiple studies and to examine specific factors (i.e., sex, age-group, sex and age-group, and PA metric). Results Based on 16 peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted between 1995 and 2017, levels of ambulatory PA are trending downward in developed countries. Significant declines were seen in both males and females (P < 0.001) as well as in children (P = 0.020), adolescents (P < 0.001), and adults (P = 0.004). The average study duration was 9.4 yr (accelerometer studies, 5.3 yr; pedometer studies, 10.8 yr). For studies that assessed steps, the average change in PA was -1118 steps per day over the course of the study (P < 0.001), and adolescents had the greatest change in PA at -2278 steps per day (P < 0.001). Adolescents also had the steepest rate of change over time, expressed in steps per day per decade. Conclusions Evidence from studies conducted in eight developed nations over a 22-yr period indicates that PA levels have declined overall, especially in adolescents. This study emphasizes the need for continued research tracking time trends in PA using wearable devices.

AB  - The prenatal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has been shown to have detrimental effects on offspring behaviour, health and productivity. The sheep has been used extensively as a model species to inform human studies. However, in the farmed environment, the consequences for the lamb of the imposition of prenatal stresses upon the ewe have received much less attention. The stressors that pregnant ewes are most frequently exposed to include sub-optimal nutrition and those related to housing, husbandry and environment which may be either acute or chronic. A systematic review of the literature was adopted to identify material which had production-relevant maternal stressors and lamb outcomes. The current review focussed upon the lamb up to weaning around the age of 100 days and the results clearly demonstrate that stressors imposed upon the ewe have implications for offspring welfare and performance. Maternal under-nutrition (UN) in the last third of pregnancy consistently impaired lamb birth-weight and subsequent vigour and performance, while earlier UN had a variable effect on performance. Feeding the ewe above requirements did not have positive effects on lamb performance and welfare. Social and husbandry stressors such as transport, shearing, mixing and physiological treatments designed to mimic acute stress which would be considered disadvantageous for the ewe had positive or neutral effects for the lamb, highlighting a potential conflict between the welfare of the ewe and her lamb. This review also identified considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly in respect of the impact of disease upon the ewe during pregnancy and interactions between different stressors and the responses of ewe and lamb.

AB  - With increased competitiveness in energy generation industries, more resources are directed in optimizing plant operation in all aspects of the production, including fault detection and diagnosis, increase efficiency, forecasting the consumption and production. One of the most powerful tools in optimizing plant operation is artificial intelligence (AI). For the last few decades there has been major interest towards intelligent condition monitoring system (ICMS) application in power plant especially with AI development particularly in artificial neural network (ANN). It should be noted that the development of the energy industry is a step towards the development of other industries. That is why the transition to the digital industry is impossible without the digitalization and intellectualization of the energy industry. With massive possibility and room for improvement in AI, the inspiration for re-searching them are apparent, and literally, hundreds of pa-pers have been published, discussing the findings of hybrid AI for condition monitoring purposes. This paper attempts to discuss and review related work of AI and its applica-tion in energy industry. With regard to the energy indus-try, the integration of artificial intelligence in the industry will help optimize and improve efficiency in all aspects of the production, transmission and consumption of energy, fault detection and diagnosis, increase efficiency, forecast-ing the consumption and production. This note provides an overview of AI methods utilized for energy sector applica-tions, based on a systematic review of over 15 papers, 3 companies and commercial initiatives. The papers are clas-sified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy industry. We conclude the paper with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.

AB  - The adaptive reuse of cultural heritage has been recognized as a driver of the circular economy. It stimulates economic growth, boosts its inherent values, and reduces material usage and energy consumption. It can be regarded unviable due to financial constraints, limitations in regulatory frameworks and lack of engagement in decision-making. To tackle these challenges, this study aims to examine the drivers and related policy instruments that support adaptive reuse practices, and to analyze the usefulness and feasibility of a set of multi-level policy enablers at varying local contexts. In this context, we first conducted a semi-systematic review of academic and gray literature and identified 19 driving factors and associated policy documents. These instruments were concentrated on administrative, regulatory and financial tools. This analysis led to the identification of policy enablers that can be adopted at three levels: European, national and local. An online survey was then conducted to investigate how a variety of local stakeholders in the selected case cities and region evaluate the adaptability of these enablers in their individual cases. The findings show that all the assessed enablers are deemed useful and feasible to a certain extent with higher score of usefulness, confirming the adaptability of these instruments into the circular economy framework. These evidence-based results can inform future policies at multiple-levels that will accelerate and scale up circular actions through heritage adaptive reuse.

AB  - Background. Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospital admission for respiratory disease among infants aged <1 year. Clinical practice guidelines can benefit patients by reducing the performance of unnecessary tests, hospital admissions, and treatment with lack of a supportive evidence base. This review aimed to identify current clinical practice guidelines worldwide, appraise their methodological quality, and discuss variability across guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis.
   Methods. A systematic literature review of electronic databases EMBASE, Global Health, and Medline was performed. Manual searches of the gray literature, national pediatric society websites, and guideline-focused databases were performed, and select international experts were contacted to identify additional guidelines. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.
   Results. Thirty-two clinical practice guidelines met the selection criteria. Quality assessment revealed significant shortcomings in a number of guidelines, including lack of systematic processes in formulating guidelines, failure to state conflicts of interest, and lack of consultation with families of affected children. There was widespread agreement about a number of aspects, such as avoidance of the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests, risk factors for severe disease, indicators for hospital admission, discharge criteria, and nosocomial infection control. However, there was variability, even within areas of consensus, over specific recommendations, such as variable thresholds for oxygen therapy. Guidelines showed significant variability in recommendations for the pharmacological management of bronchiolitis, with conflicting recommendations over whether use of nebulized epinephrine, hypertonic saline, or bronchodilators should be routinely trialled.
   Conclusions. Future guidelines should aim to be compliant with international standards for clinical guidelines to improve their quality and clarity and to promote their adoption into practice. Variable recommendations between guidelines may reflect the evolving evidence base for bronchiolitis management, and platforms should be created to understand this variability and promote evidence-based recommendations.

AB  - Industry is adopting artificial intelligence (AI) at a rapid pace and a growing number of countries have declared national AI strategies. However, several spectacular AI failures have led to ethical concerns about responsibility in AI development and use, which gave rise to the emerging field of responsible AI (RAI). The field of responsible innovation (RI) has a longer history and evolved toward a framework for the entire research, development, and innovation life cycle. However, this research demonstrates that the uptake of RI by RAI has been slow. RAI has been developing independently, with three times the number of publications than RI. The objective and knowledge contribution of this research was to understand how RAI has been developing independently from RI and contribute to how RI could be leveraged toward the progression of RAI in a causal loop diagram. It is concluded that stakeholder engagement of citizens from diverse cultures across the Global North and South is a policy leverage point for moving the RI adoption by RAI toward global best practice. A role-specific recommendation for policy makers is made to deploy modes of engaging with the Global South with more urgency to avoid the risk of harming vulnerable populations. As an additional methodological contribution, this study employs a novel method, systematic science mapping, which combines systematic literature reviews with science mapping. This new method enabled the discovery of an emerging 'axis of adoption' of RI by RAI around the thematic areas of ethics, governance, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability. 828 Scopus articles were mapped for RI and 2489 articles were mapped for RAI. The research presented here is by any measure the largest systematic literature review of both fields to date and the only cross-disciplinary review from a methodological perspective.

AB  - Agriculture plays an important role in sustaining all human activities. Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.

AB  - Historically, roads and transportation have been critical and essential factors in the development and prosperity of cities and societies. The well-being of cities and their expansion were measured by the road networks that linked them to the rest of the world, especially the land roads, which were the biggest challenges for communities. With time, the transportation sector has become an integral part of human life. However, this contribution to the development of cities has come to collide with the challenges arising from the means of transportation, which include large-scale environmental, economic, and social impacts on the communities benefiting from them. Therefore, it has become necessary to make transportation, especially public transportation, sustainable to address environmental challenges such as climate change. To achieve this, more than two thousand research papers published between 2002 and 2022 and retrieved from scientific databases using specific and connected keywords were preliminarily investigated based on the year and number of citations. It was necessary to identify the important sustainability indicators for each sector and study them closely in a detailed manner. We concluded that the sustainability of public transportation is directly affected by environmental, economic, technical, and social factors which can be expressed as follows: 1-emissions, pollution, and the consumption of energy resources as environmental indicators related to sustainability; 2-travel time, cost, travel distance, and operation cost as economic indicators; 3-social demographics, accessibility, and travel behaviours and time as social indicators; and 4-traffic flow, speed, and availability of infrastructures as technical indicators that affect transport sustainability.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss caused by road development are recognized as major threats to biodiversity and challenges to reconcile the pursuit of economic growth with the protection of wildlife habitats. Assessment of potential environmental impacts is essential in planning and design of road projects. Behavioral responses such as road avoidance that causes barrier effects are critical in assessment of effects of roads on species persistence. In this study, we synthesized literature of barrier effects on mammals to identify road characteristics and species traits that might serve as management indicators to anticipate barrier effects. We conducted a meta-analysis with 118 statistics of road crossings by 45 species from 36 studies. We used logit-transformed proportion of individuals not crossing roads as the effect size of barrier effect. Overall, all types of roads, from major highways to narrow forest roads, can impede movements for certain species of mammals. For data collected by observational methods, body mass, road width, road surface and data collection methods explained 53% of variation among data. Barrier effect decreased as body mass increased, and was increased by greater road width. Paved roads posed stronger barriers compared to gravel dirt roads. Capture-recapture methods tended to detect a weaker barrier effect compared to methods that tracked individual movements. For data collected by experimental translocation, the probability of crossing following translocation was not affected by road width and body mass. We showed that interspecific variation of mammals in barrier effects can be explained by road characteristics and body size under natural condition, and can be useful to anticipate the species-specific magnitude of barrier effects of roads and aid in planning and design of road projects, as well as reassessment of existing roads.

AB  - There is a growing concern on a global scale that the world should transition towards the utilisation of energy-efficient technologies. Hydropower plays a very significant part in the fight against climate change, and as a result, it lessens the impact that climate changewill have on our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both the effectiveness of hydro-power generation and the amount of streamflow are impacted by climate change as well as land use and land cover (LULC). Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to conduct a literature review on the topic of the past and future effects of climate, land use, and land cover changes on hydropower generation. This review will be based on the entries found in a number of reliable databases. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse how LULC and climate change will affect hydropower generation and development. The research was based on 158 pieces of relevant literature that had been reviewed by experts and indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The review was carried out to determine three goals in mind: the impact of climate change on hydropower generation and development; the impact of climate change on streamflow; and the combined impact of changes in climate and changes in LULC on hydropower. The findings bring to light the primary factors contributing to climate change as well as shifts in LULC which are essential to the generation of hydropower on all scales. The study identifies factors such as precipitation, temperature, floods, and droughts as examples of climate change. Deforestation, afforestation, and urbanisation are identified as the primary causes of changes in LULC over the past several decades. These changes have a negative impact on the generation and development of hydropower.

AB  - Although the importance of urban infrastructure resilience can be inferred, its terminology remains convoluted within the literature due to a lack of systematic review from a sustainable development planning perspective. This review paper was designed to elucidate connected research themes, scientific popularity, and conceptual boundaries of the term infrastructure resilience in an urban context. Three guiding research questions were asked: What does urban infrastructure resilience really mean? What are the most common research topics connected to urban infrastructure resilience? How can humanity further improve urban infrastructure resilience from a sustainable development planning perspective? To answer these research questions, a two-step literature analysis was adopted consisting of: (i) a scoping review to select relevant publications based on a specific search query; and (ii) a content analysis to reduce and synthesize the scoping review findings further based on the three most applicable publishing outlets. The scoping review reduced articles to 535, while content analysis further condensed it to 84 across three key journals. With North America and Europe leading, the findings corroborated that eight connected subject areas establish the conceptual boundaries of urban infrastructure resilience. The eight related research topics in decreasing abundance were: (1) climate change, (2) floods, (3) disasters, (4) environmental policy, (5) ecosystems, (6) risk assessment, (7) emergency preparedness, and (8) adaptation. In conclusion, these research topics should be pursued when creating urban infrastructure resilience strategies for moving towards sustainability.

AB  - Reliance on groundwater is increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa as development programmes work towards improving water access and strengthening resilience to climate change. In lower-income areas, groundwater supplies are typically installed without water quality treatment infrastructure or services. This practice is underpinned by an assumption that untreated groundwater is typically suitable for drinking due to the relative microbiological safety of groundwater compared to surface water; however, chemistry risks are largely dis-regarded. This article systematically reviews groundwater chemistry results from 160 studies to evaluate po-tential health risk in two case countries: Ethiopia and Kenya. Most studies evaluated drinking water suitability, focusing on priority parameters (fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, or salinity; 18 %), pollution impacts (10 %), or overall suitability (45 %). The remainder characterised general hydrogeochemistry (13 %), flow dynamics (10 %), or water quality suitability for irrigation (3 %). Only six studies (4 %) reported no exceedance of drinking water quality thresholds. Thus, chemical contaminants occur widely in groundwaters that are used for drinking but are not regularly monitored: 78 % of studies reported exceedance of contaminants that have direct health conse-quences ranging from hypertension to disrupted cognitive development and degenerative disease, and 81 % reported exceedance of aesthetic parameters that have indirect health impacts by influencing perception and use of groundwater versus surface water. Nevertheless, the spatiotemporal coverage of sampling has substantial gaps and data availability bias is driven by a) the tendency for research to concentrate in areas with known water quality problems, and b) analytical capacity limitations. Improved in-country analytical capacity could bolster more efficient assessment and prioritisation of water chemistry risks. Overall, this review demonstrates that universal and equitable access to safe drinking water (Sustainable Development Goal target 6.1) will not be achieved without wider implementation of groundwater treatment, thus a shift is required in how water systems are designed and managed.

AB  - There is an urgent need for a trans-disciplinary approach for the collective evaluation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) benefits and risks. Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual end-points with emphasis on ENM risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine ENM benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of ENM SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the SEE system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable ENMs in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature. Rather, it is a position paper that largely expresses the views of the authors based on their expert opinion drawn from industrial and academic experience. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Apple is one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops world-wide, and apple yield benefits from pollination by insects. The global decline in wild pollinator populations raises concern about the adequacy of pollination services in apple production. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of pollination in apple. We assembled from the literature a dataset comprising results of 48 studies across five continents on fruit set and seed set in apple with insect pollination, artificial pollination and pollinator exclusion, and analysed the effects of explanatory factors such as variety and continent. Fruit set was on average 41% lower with open pollination than with artificial pollination, while seed set was 20% lower. These pollination deficits varied across continents and cultivars. Pollination deficits for fruit set were greatest in Asia (63%) followed by Europe (30%), whereas pollination deficits for seed set were greatest in Asia (47%) and South America (40%). Important differences in pollination deficit were also identified between cultivars but these differences were confounded with continent effects. Fruit set and seed set were 71% and 62% higher, respectively, when insects had open access to flowers than when they were artificially excluded, while results varied among cultivars. Synthesis and applications. Globally, there are substantial contributions of pollinators to fruit set and seed set in apple, as well as considerable limitations in apple pollination services, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. Several management strategies could be applied to reduce the pollination deficits in apple production: (1) conserving wild bees and enhancing their abundance and diversity, (2) using managed bees for pollination, (3) using varieties with low pollinator dependency and/or (4) artificial pollination. These strategies should be tailored to the regional situation, considering the potential of landscapes for restoring wild pollinators, the acceptability of cultivated varieties for available pollinators, the acceptance in the market of self-compatible varieties and the costs of management, such as artificial pollination, pollinator conservation, beekeeping and planting self-compatible varieties. Conservation of wild pollinators is preferred in regions with sufficient potential for wild pollinators as it contributes to biodiversity conservation and improves pollination in both crops and wild plants.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only the functioning of food supply chains but also the performance and outcomes of agri-food systems. In this context, this paper analyses the scholarly literature dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on West African agriculture and food systems. A search carried out on the Web of Science in March 2023 returned 176 records and 87 eligible documents were included in the systematic review. The bibliometric analysis suggests a decreasing interest in the research field. Moreover, a large share of the eligible articles are authored by researchers based outside West Africa. There is a research gap, especially in Cabo Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Niger and Togo. Studies focus on the crop production subsector and consumption stage. The pandemic affected all four dimensions/pillars of food security (viz. availability, access, utilisation/use, and stability). However, most of the analysed documents focus on food access (economic accessibility and physical accessibility). Moreover, COVID-19 affected all the dimensions of agri-food systems (viz. environmental, economic, social, and political) but the analysed articles focus on the pandemic's socio-economic impacts, especially those relating to food security and health. The promotion of research on the impacts of the pandemic on agri-food systems in West Africa is paramount to designing the evidence-based policies needed to improve the preparedness of the region for current and future crises and shocks.

AB  - Climate change is increasingly threatening coastal communities around the world. This article reviews the literature on climate change impacts and adaptation in the Chesapeake Bay region (USA). We reviewed both climate impacts and adaptation literature (n = 283) published in the period 2007-2018 to answer the questions: (i) how are indicators of climate impacts measured and reported by different types of authors (e.g., scientists, government, and NGOs), document types (e.g., academic articles or reports), and geographic focus (e.g., State, region, county, or municipal level)? (ii) what are the current approaches for measuring the most pressing climate impacts in the Chesapeake Bay? We found that scientists produce the most amount of data but are increasingly shifting towards engaging with practitioners through reports and online resources. Most indicators focus on the Chesapeake Bay scale, but data is most needed at the local level where adaptive policies are implemented. Our analysis shows emerging approaches to monitoring climate hazards and areas where synergies between types of authors are likely to increase resilience in the 21st century. This review expands the understanding of the information network in the Chesapeake Bay and explores the institutional landscape of stakeholders involved in the production and consumption of environmental and social change data. The analysis and insights of this review may be extended to similar regions around the planet experiencing or anticipating similar climate hazards to the Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) is a biological treatment technology that has been extensively studied in the last decade. The possibility of resource recovery has always been highlighted in these systems, but real-scale applications are still scarce. Therefore, this paper aimed to present a systematic review of resources recovery such as water, energy, chemicals, raw materials, and nutrients from AGS systems, also analyzing aspects of engineering and economic viability. In the solid phase, sludge application in agriculture is an interesting possibility. However, the biosolids' metal concentration (the granules have high adsorption capacity due to the high concentration of extracellular polymeric substances, EPS) may be an issue. Another possibility is the recovery of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and Alginate-like exopolymers (bio-ALE) in the solid phase, emphasizing the last one, which has already been made in some Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs), named and patented as Kaumera (R) process. The Operational Expenditure (OPEX) can be reduced by 50% in the WWTP when recovery of ALE is made. The ALE recovery reduced sludge yield by up to 35%, less CO2 emissions, and energy saving. Finally, the discharged sludge can also be evaluated to be used for energetic purposes via anaerobic digestion (AD) or combustion. However, the AD route has faced difficulties due to the low biodegradability of aerobic granules.

AB  - Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

AB  - Objectives: Parents can play an integral role in managing their child's pain, yet many parents remain unaware of evidence-based strategies to support their child during painful experiences. Recent advances in knowledge translation research, which include dissemination and implementation studies, have resulted in programs geared towards parents to offset this knowledge gap. The nature of these programs and the degree to which parents find them useful remains unclear. Our goal was to systematically review programs aimed as disseminating and implementing evidence-based pain-related knowledge to parents. Materials and Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were completed. Articles in which information was disseminated to parents with the goal of assessing dissemination and implementation outcomes were retained. Information was extracted to identify study characteristics, primary outcomes, and quality of evidence. Results: A total of 24,291 abstracts were screened and 12 articles describing programs were retained. Programs were positively rated by parents in terms of the appropriateness of formats selected, presentation of information, and helpfulness of content. The majority of research has been focused in the area of procedural pain among infants. Although several implementation domains are reported by researchers, certain areas have been overlooked to date, including the cost and sustainability of programs. The majority of reports presented with methodological limitations and bias. Discussion: Knowledge translation research in pediatric pain is in its infancy. Development of theories and guidelines to increase the utility and quality of evidence are needed.

AB  - This study aims to review determinants of the social exclusion (SE) of small farmers in the agriculture sector, which is one of the key approaches to creating sustainable rural development and an integral part of the country's economic development. The selected group's social and economic underpinnings play a vital role in their productive decision-making regarding rural development. As per the literature review, databases of peer-reviewed scientific publications, and official publications of the relevant fields from 2005 to 2020, it has been deduced that the literature lacks elucidated support on the small landholder (SLH) in defining their marginality and social exclusion. This study particularly attempts to fill this gap by reviewing the comprehensive research of said domains. A precise and effective list of main players in this field to the smallholders throughout the developing and developed countries has been produced. Findings indicate that government interventions in terms of the welfare system, credit facilities, agriculture resources, access to the market, and migration of farmers significantly influence decreasing social exclusion, food security, and attainment of the SDGs. Moreover, educational systems through farmer social networks, farmer-based organizations, and farmer field schools help adapt to climate change and the latest agricultural technologies, increase livelihood choices, reduce poverty and inequalities, empower women, and improve the social status of farmers. This is ultimately and positively associated with the social inclusion of small farmers and sustainable economic development.

AB  - Sustainable urban development is a major issue in developing countries, namely in environmental and social aspects. Urban forests have the potential to address these issues. Thus, it is not surprising that urban forest research is slowly gaining traction in these regions. However, there have been limited urban forest research reviews focusing on developing countries, especially tropical countries in the global south. Research reviews are vital in identifying the distribution of research themes, hence revealing research gaps and needs. Therefore, this review paper aims to provide a deep insight into the development of urban forest research in Malaysia in the past 20 years. The core purpose of this review is to analyze the distribution of research themes in Malaysia, thus identifying research gaps and needs in developing countries. A total of 43 articles were selected for this review, using the PRISMA framework. The distribution of research articles showed a continuous increase over time, especially for the past five years (2016 to 2021). The reviewed articles were categorized according to five emerging research themes in urban forestry. More than 41% of the reviewed articles fell under Theme 1 (the physicality of urban forests), with the majority being on biodiversity (n = 10). Theme 5 (the governance of urban forest) had the lowest research output (n = 3). Urban forestry research is slowly gaining prominence globally including the global south; however, there are obvious preferences in research focus, causing some research questions to be neglected. These research gaps are especially evident in four areas-soil science, ecophysiology, valuation (economics), and environmental justice. These research gaps should be addressed by the scientific community to ensure a thorough and complete research growth pertaining to urban forestry.

AB  - Mediterranean rural systems, understood as socio-ecological systems (SES), often face complex sustainability challenges arising from the structural coupling of ecological and socioeconomic processes, climatic pressures, and weak adaptive capacities. Living labs are gradually gaining ground as an approach to tackling complex sustainability challenges. However, the existing literature is urban-focused and little attention has been paid to the implementation of living labs in rural contexts. This study fills this gap by addressing whether the increasingly popular living lab approach is suitable for pursuing systemic innovation for sustainable development in rural SES. Through a systematic review of the existing literature, this paper offers a contemporary perspective on living labs as models to support systemic innovation and governance of rural SES, while also accounting for previous interpretations of the concept. The paper then moves to a critical discussion of the main constraints on living lab conceptualisation and operationalisation and provides several recommendations for more effective and transparent use of living labs in rural SES. We argue that it is paramount to recognise living labs not solely as laboratories to validate techno-scientific solutions, but also as living systems that can be designed as social learning spaces to improve situations of complexity and uncertainty. In this sense, the success of living labs is contingent upon the willingness and capacity of both stakeholders and researchers to remain actively engaged in social learning and co-creation processes.

AB  - Purpose Although product design is a fundamental element in the transition towards the circular economy, the knowledge of practices, methods and tools oriented to circular product design has not been widely developed. This study aims to contribute to the circular economy research area by investigating and analyzing the main design approaches to circular products and their relationship to new product development. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a systematic review and qualitative analysis of 120 articles. In these studies, the authors analyzed aspects such as design strategies used, the barriers to the adoption of circular product design and the relationships between the phases of new product development processes with circular product design studies. Findings The findings revealed that the circular product design approach has added new design strategies to those already recommended by ecodesign, such as multiple use cycles, emotional durability and biomimicry. Furthermore, the results showed that most circular product design articles focus on the planning and concept development phases of the new product development process. Originality/value In this article, the authors systematized the findings of an emergent research area: the development of new products for the circular economy. Its main contributions lie in the identification of design strategies, the classification of Design for X approaches, analysis of such approaches during the new product development process and discussion of their main barriers.

AB  - Featured Application Bibliometric analysis of SDG-related papers with CATAR can help academic scholars, public sectors, and practitioners utilize the growing volume of literature. This study employed a comprehensive systematic review of the literature (SRL) process with the Content Analysis Toolkits for Academic Research (CATAR) for conducting a bibliometric analysis of the 2814 general SDG-related papers and 92 review papers selected from the Web of Science database from 2013 to 2022. The overview analysis found that the US and UK took the lead in publication and citation. The WHO and several universities were identified as the most prominent institutes around the globe. The field distribution of the most cited papers revealed the existence of a "strong sustainability" paradigm and the importance of science and technology. A landscape of 1123 papers was included in eight clusters according to the bibliographic coupling algorithms in the Multi-stage Document Clustering (MSDC) process. These clusters were then categorized into three groups, "synergies and trade-offs", "networking", and "systems analysis", demonstrated in the theme maps. As for the 92 SDG-related review papers, most were shaped based on literature analysis without specified countries. Moreover, SDG 3 was identified as that exclusively studied in most papers. The information presented is expected to help research scholars, public sectors, and practitioners monitor, gather, check, analyze, and use the growing volume of SDG-related academic articles.

AB  - Textile, apparel, and fashion (TAF) industries contribute significantly to global environmental pollution at every point of the supply chain. Clothing manufacturing and transportation produce a large volume of waste and high greenhouse gas emissions, often taking advantage of cheap labor in developing countries. As a result, stakeholders are becoming more aware of the effect of the textile, apparel, and fashion industries on the climate and human rights, thus pushing businesses to mitigate their environmental damage. This paper offers a systematic literature review of sustainability trends in the TAF industries in the last 20 years. Bibliometric tools are also used to support the content analysis of the papers. The findings reveal three primary research areas in the TAF context: consumers' behaviour towards sustainable clothing, circular economy initiatives, and sustainability challenges across the whole supply chain. As a result, this study highlights literature gaps and provides future research suggestions for each identified research cluster. In addition, drivers and barriers to implementing corporate social responsibility and circular economy practices are identified. Consequently, this study will help researchers and academicians work in this area to identify unexplored sub-fields, which reflect some potential investigation areas for expanding scientific literature on the topic. Finally, this study supports practitioners and managers in exploring the main research themes addressed in the scientific field, providing knowledge to improve and align business models with current sustainability trends.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a leading cause of death for Canadian Aboriginal peoples; developing effective interventions should be a public health priority. While intervention research has been conducted outside of Canada, few formal program evaluations have been conducted in Canada. We reviewed Canadian and non-Canadian Indigenous road safety initiatives to inform future program development in Canada.
   METHODS: A systematic review of the published and grey literature examining MVC intervention programs in Indigenous communities was performed. Studies published after 1980 reporting pre-post comparisons of MVC interventions in Indigenous communities were included in the review. These studies were assessed using a modified Participatory Action Research quality assessment tool. Haddon's Matrix of injury epidemiology and prevention was used to categorize crash-related risk factors targeted in the MVC interventions.
   SYNTHESIS: A total of 11 studies met inclusion criteria, including 1 Canadian study and 10 non-Canadian studies. Successful intervention components included focus groups, training community members, educational activities, distribution of safety devices, collaboration with local law officials to enhance enforcement, driver-licensing courses, and incentive programs. Potential barriers to successful implementation and evaluation involved lack of incorporation of cultural and contextual factors, enforcement factors, and methodological limitations.
   CONCLUSION: Several effective strategies to reduce MVCs can be adapted and implemented at the community and national levels. Future directions might include using multiple intervention components and incorporating a collaborative, culturally and contextually appropriate approach, while promoting evaluation initiatives and widespread dissemination of findings.

AB  - The rapid growth of urban populations and the need for sustainable urban planning and development has made Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) a valuable tool for data collection, mapping, and monitoring. This article reviews the applications of UAV technology in sustainable urban development, particularly in Malaysia. It explores the potential of UAVs to transform infrastructure projects and enhance urban systems, underscoring the importance of advanced applications in Southeast Asia and developing nations worldwide. Following the PRISMA 2020 statement, this article adopts a systematic review process and identifies 98 relevant studies out of 591 records, specifically examining the use of UAVs in urban planning. The emergence of the UAV-as-a-service sector has led to specialized companies offering UAV operations for site inspections, 3D modeling of structures and terrain, boundary assessment, area estimation, master plan formulation, green space analysis, environmental monitoring, and archaeological monument mapping. UAVs have proven to be versatile tools with applications across multiple fields, including precision agriculture, forestry, construction, surveying, disaster response, security, and education. They offer advantages such as high-resolution imagery, accessibility, and operational safety. Varying policies and regulations concerning UAV usage across countries present challenges for commercial and research UAVs. In Malaysia, UAVs have become essential in addressing challenges associated with urbanization, including traffic congestion, urban sprawl, pollution, and inadequate social facilities. However, several obstacles need to be overcome before UAVs can be effectively deployed, including regulatory barriers, limited flight time and range, restricted awareness, lack of skilled personnel, and concerns regarding security and privacy. Successful implementation requires coordination among public bodies, industry stakeholders, and the public. Future research in Malaysia should prioritize 3D modeling and building identification, using the results of this study to propel advancements in other ASEAN countries.

AB  - Climate change poses a significant challenge to primary industries and adaptation will be required to reduce detrimental impacts and realise opportunities. Despite the breadth of information to support adaptation planning however, knowledge is fragmented, obscuring information needs, hampering strategic planning and constraining decision-making capacities. In this letter, we present and apply the Adaptation Knowledge Cycle (AKC), a heuristic for rapidly evaluating and systematising adaptation research by analytical foci: Impacts, Implications, Decisions or Actions. We demonstrate its application through an assessment of ten years' climate change adaptation research for New Zealand's primary industries. The letter draws on the results of systematic review, empirical analysis, workshops, interviews, narrative analyses and pathways planning to synthesise information and identify knowledge gaps. Results show the heuristic's simplicity is valuable for cross- and transdisciplinary communication on adaptation in New Zealand's primary industries. Results also provide insight into what we know and need to know with respect to undertaking adaptation planning. With the development of tools and processes to inform decision making under conditions of uncertainty- such as adaptation pathways-it is increasingly important to efficiently and accurately determine knowledge needs. The combination of systematic data collection techniques, and heuristics such as the AKC may provide researchers and stakeholders with an efficient, robust tool to review and synthesise existing knowledge, and identify emerging research priorities. Results can in turn support the design of targeted research and inform adaptation strategies for policy and practice.

AB  - The circular economy and low-carbon economy are closely interconnected as pillars of global sustainable development. However, no consensus exists on how to maximize the carbon reduction benefits of circular practices. This paper illustrates the nexus and identifies synergy paths between low-carbon actions and circular practices via a systematic and critical review. Results show that the mutual promotion relationship is the most studied in the existing literature (63.48%), followed by the parallel status (38.20%) and the trade-offs (3.37%). To enhance synergy mechanisms such as urban-industrial symbiosis and critical raw material cycles, challenges related to cost/risk reduction, urban/industrial planning and inter-system barriers should be addressed. Potential trade-offs arise mainly from carbon-intensive electricity, circular economy rebound and raw material scarcity, requiring a comprehensive consideration of the territorial energy supply structure and circular economy chains. Fiscal and informational interventions from the government, and the technological and business innovations they foster, are the shared drivers. Low-carbon actions and circular practices work together to serve the sustainable development of entities under various scales and dimensions. Three principles are proposed for decision-makers to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs: (1) prioritize non-end-of-life strategies to meet the surging de-mand for critical raw materials in the short term, (2) adjust the mix of circular practices following the pace of low-carbon energy transition, and (3) implement more bio-projects that contribute to a win-win situation for the transition to renewable energy and integrated bio-waste management. Briefly, circular practices reduce carbon emissions more effectively when tailored to local and immediate conditions. Future research should focus more on the time-varying features of different circular practices, factors behind household and individual behaviors, and social sustainability.

AB  - In various parts of Africa, scholars have paid a great deal of attention to TEK, focusing mainly on their role in biodiversity conservation or natural resource management. Despite individual efforts made so far, the consolidated information about the role of TEK in biodiversity conservation remains uncertain in Africa. A systematic literature search on the role of TEK in biodiversity conservation was conducted on ISI Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar databases. The search produced 40 papers in 12 countries in Africa that were published between 2001 and 2022. Majority of studies on TEK (40%; n = 16) reported in the reviewed literature were from West Africa and no study was found in North Africa. The study found the regular use of different but interrelated forms of TEK in Africa. These include taboos and totems, customs and rituals, rules and regulations, metaphors and proverbs, traditional protected areas (social institutions), local knowledge of plants, animals and landscapes, and resource management systems. Although these forms of TEK have great potential for in situ natural resource management, metaphors and proverbs were found to be least addressed (n = 4) component of TEK. Despite TEK having played a significant role in biodiversity conservation in present-day Africa, the traditions are being threatened by changing cultural mores and practices (including Christianity and Islam), formal education, modernisation and new political dispensations. The findings of this study demonstrate that large geographic areas remain unexplored and this may hide part of the narrative. Reviewed literature suggests that metaphors and proverbs are least represented. New studies should be dedicated towards filling these gaps. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided to improve management practices for TEK in Africa.

AB  - Agri-food markets are vital in achieving food security, especially for resource-poor, food-importing countries such as Qatar. The paper provides an overview of the evolution of agri-food markets in Qatar and explores the implications of past and ongoing changes in terms of food security and food system sustainability. In particular, the review analyzes drivers of changes, trends, and challenges as well as policy responses to address the emerging challenges while ensuring the country's food security. It draws upon a systematic review of scholarly literature indexed in the Web of Science as well as data from gray literature (e.g., reports) and databases (e.g., FAOSTAT). Different drivers (e.g., population growth with huge expatriate inflow, urbanization, income increase) affected the functioning of agri-food markets as well as the structure of the food chain (viz. production, processing, distribution, consumption) in Qatar. In addition to drivers, the food-related trends were also shaped by numerous environmental (e.g., land/water scarcity), economic, health, and trade challenges. To ensure long-term food and nutrition security for its population, Qatar implemented various policies and strategies (e.g., National Food Security Strategy 2018-2023). In this context, agri-food markets, as functional links between production and consumption, can foster transition towards sustainable food consumption and production patterns in Qatar.

AB  - PurposeThis paper undertakes an extensive and systematic review of the literature on earnings management (EM) over the past three decades (1992-2022). Furthermore, the study identifies emerging research themes and proposes future avenues for further investigation in the realm of EM.Design/methodology/approachFor this study, a comprehensive collection of 2,775 articles on EM published between 1992 and 2022 was extracted from the Scopus database. The author employed various tools, including Microsoft Excel, R studio, Gephi and visualization of similarities viewer, to conduct bibliometric, content, thematic and cluster analyses. Additionally, the study examined the literature across three distinct periods: prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (1992-2001), subsequent to the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002-2012), and after the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (2013-2022) to draw more inferences and insights on EM research.FindingsThe study identifies three major themes, namely the operationalization of EM constructs, the trade-off between EM tools (accrual EM, real EM and classification shifting) and the role of corporate governance in mitigating EM in emerging markets. Existing literature in these areas presents mixed and inconclusive findings, suggesting the need for further theoretical development. Further, the study findings observe a shift in research focus over time: initially, understanding manipulation techniques, then evaluating regulatory measures, and more recently, investigating the impact of global accounting standards. Several emerging research themes (technology advancements, cross-cultural and cross-national studies, sustainability, behavioral aspects and non-financial indicators of EM) have been identified. This study subsequent analysis reveals an evolving EM landscape, with researchers from disciplines like data science, computer science and engineering applying their analytical expertise to detect EM anomalies. Furthermore, this study offers significant insights into sophisticated EM techniques such as neural networks, machine learning techniques and hidden Markov models, among others, as well as relevant theories including dynamic capabilities theory, learning curve theory, psychological contract theory and normative institutional theory. These techniques and theories demonstrate the need for further advancement in the field of EM. Lastly, the findings shed light on prominent EM journals, authors and countries.Originality/valueThis study conducts quantitative bibliometric and thematic analyses of the existing literature on EM while identifying areas that require further development to advance EM research.

AB  - Natural river sand is preferred as fine aggregate. A large percentage of concrete comprises fine aggregates and hence river sand is over-mined due to the higher demand in the construction sector. Mining of natural river sand affects river banks and is banned in many countries. Earlier studies suggested recycled aggregates as an alternative to river sand. Although studies on the use of recycled fine aggregates have been reported, a systematic review on the comparison of recycled aggregates with other alternative fine aggregates is highly limited. Hence, the present review comprehensively compares the performance of recycled fine aggregates concretes with other alternative fine aggregates such as granite dust, crushed rock, ceramic waste, recycled glass aggregates, recycled brick aggregates, recycled plastic aggregates, and recycled rubber aggregates. Fresh, mechanical, durability properties such as compressive strength, workability, modulus of elasticity, split tensile strength, flexural strength, carbonation, chloride ion penetration, water absorption, sorptivity, permeability, abrasion, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and shrinkage of various alternative fine aggregate used concrete are meticulously compared. The water absorption for recycled concrete fine aggregate used concrete is found to be within the permissible limit for replacement levels of river sand in-between 15%-45%. Research studies also suggested better sorptivity values for recycled concrete fine aggregate used concrete for replacement levels of fine aggregate between 5% and 25%

AB  - This study analyzed the international key literature on integrated disaster risk management (IDRM), considering it a dynamic sociocultural process subjected to the historical process of social formation, offering a closer look at the concept while exploring conceptual elements and ideas to advance IDRM in both national and international contexts. Methodologically, the study adopted a literature review strategy, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, combined with qualitative content analysis. This article examines the history of IDRM, discusses current challenges for implementation, looks at some experiences, and proposes avenues for further research. Some findings point out the lack of an overarching IDRM approach, which is characterized by a rather disperse set of ideas and experiences concerning what IDRM is and how it should be operationalized, thereby revealing the need for a more comprehensive theory and methodologies to further advance it. Other findings highlight that IDRM encompasses different kinds and levels of "integrations" that go from internal (that is, disaster risk reduction and management domains) to external (that is, all societal processes such as sustainable development), including temporal and spatial integrations. Hence, we are talking about a multidimensional integration of disaster risk management. In this regard, the article proposes four dimensions for integration: sectoral, spatial/hierarchical, temporal, and externally with other cross-cutting societal challenges, especially climate change and sustainable development. These dimensions cover 29 ideas for indicators or "proto-indicators" to guide the discussion, exploration, and analysis of IDRM in specific contexts.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management has been a topic of high interest to scholars and practitioners over the last 30 years. Accordingly, many review papers have been published on this topic with various areas of focus. Nevertheless, the overall body of literature still lacks a systematic review that thoroughly explores sustainability-driven decisions in the agriculture sector. To fill this research gap, the present paper presents an extensive review of 247 quantitative studies on sustainable agricultural supply chains. Our review scope includes both crop-based and livestock sectors that are monitored by eco-social corporate initiatives or government sustainability-driven legislation. To do so, we employ a content analysis-based review method, which is well known as an effective means of conducting literature reviews in a transparent, systematic, and rule-governed way, to rigorously collect, filter, and classify the existing research context. We classify the collected materials based on different structural dimensions and related analytic categories, which are obtained from both deductive and inductive categorization techniques. More specifically, we thoroughly evaluate the review results from four research perspectives agricultural planning, supply chain management, sustainability development, and modeling methodology aiming at presenting an overview of quantitative research projects. We conclude this study with a detailed discussion on evolving and promising research streams along with future research directions, which could be used as a roadmap by future researchers.

AB  - Mangrove forests in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are facing multiple threats from natural and anthropogenic-driven land use change stressors, contributing to altered ecosystem conditions. Remote sensing tools can be used to monitor mangroves, measure mangrove forest-and-tree-level attributes and vegetation indices at different spatial and temporal scales that allow a detailed and comprehensive understanding of these important ecosystems. Using a systematic literature approach, we reviewed 58 remote sensing-based mangrove assessment articles published from 2010 through 2022. The main objectives of the study were to examine the extent of mangrove distribution and cover, and the remotely sensed data sources used to assess mangrove forest/tree attributes. The key importance of and threats to mangroves that were specific to the region were also examined. Mangrove distribution and cover were mainly estimated from satellite images (75.2%), using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from Landsat (73.3%), IKONOS (15%), Sentinel (11.7%), WorldView (10%), QuickBird (8.3%), SPOT-5 (6.7%), MODIS (5%) and others (5%) such as PlanetScope. Remotely sensed data from aerial photographs/images (6.7%), LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) (5%) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)/Drones (3.3%) were the least used. Mangrove cover decreased in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait between 1996 and 2020. However, mangrove cover increased appreciably in Qatar and remained relatively stable for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the same period, which was attributed to government conservation initiatives toward expanding mangrove afforestation and restoration through direct seeding and seedling planting. The reported country-level mangrove distribution and cover change results varied between studies due to the lack of a standardized methodology, differences in satellite imagery resolution and classification approaches used. There is a need for UAV-LiDAR ground truthing to validate country-and-local-level satellite data. Urban development-driven coastal land reclamation and pollution, climate change-driven temperature and sea level rise, drought and hypersalinity from extreme evaporation are serious threats to mangrove ecosystems. Thus, we encourage the prioritization of mangrove conservation and restoration schemes to support the achievement of related UN Sustainable Development Goals (13 climate action, 14 life below water, and 15 life on land) in the GCC countries.

AB  - Insufficient physical activity (PA) is the fourth major risk factor for many non-communicable diseases and premature mortality worldwide. Features of the built environment (BE) play a considerable role in determining population PA behaviors. The majority of evidence for PA-BE relationships comes from high-income countries and may not be generalizable to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aim to systematically review the literature and assess the associations between perceived and/or objective BE characteristics and PA domains in LMICs. This review adopted a systematic search strategy for English language articles published between January 2000 and June 2019 from four electronic databases-Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PubMed- adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies addressing the associations between self-reported and/or objective BE and PA were only included if they were conducted in LMICs, according to the World Bank classification list. Articles investigating PA-BE relationships across any age groups were included, and all study designs were eligible, except for qualitative studies and reviews. Thirty-three studies were included for evidence synthesis. Cross-sectional studies were the most prevailing study design (97%), revealing a notable gap in longitudinal PA-BE research in LMICs. A majority of the BE factors were not associated with different PA domains while others (e.g., density, proximity to services, aesthetics) exhibited an inconsistent association. Land-use mix diversity was positively associated with transport PA and the presence of recreation facilities resulted in an increase in PA during leisure-time. Increased safety from crime at night consistently increased total PA and walking levels. Research exploring the associations between BE attributes and PA behaviors in LMICs appears to be limited and is primarily cross-sectional. Longitudinal research studies with objective measures are needed for inferring well-grounded PA-BE causal relationships and informing the design of evidence-based environmental interventions for increasing PA levels in LMICs.

AB  - In light of the significance of Food Supply Chains (FSCs) in attaining the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a greater focus on synergistic interactions between these SDGs is called for. Although there is research within this area, the impact on the interactions of responsible consumption and production for supply chains is either fragmented or inconclusive. Implementing supply chain solutions to achieve one goal could potentially support or inhibit progress in other goals; thus, before implementing such solutions, a better understanding of the interrelationships between SDGs is required. A systematic review is conducted to evidence the current nature of the understanding of these interrelationships within the food supply chain context by focusing on Responsible Consumption and Production, which refers to SDG number 12. This review is conducted through a filtering process, where 171 peer-reviewed articles addressing different SDGs were analysed and synthesized. In addition to a detailed summary of the recent literature on the SDGs and their interrelationships, as addressed in the literature, this paper establishes the limitations in the existing literature and research challenges surrounding the SDGs. This article contributes a conceptual framework that identifies stakeholder and consumer pressures as enablers of synergistic interactions between SDGs, thus directing managerial and regulatory interventions through a holistic perspective of SDGs. Finally, the review discusses contradictory findings on SDGs and provides future research avenues.

AB  - 1. Conflict between humans and large carnivores hinders carnivore conservation worldwide. Livestock depredations by large carnivores is the main cause of conflict, triggering poaching and retaliatory killings by humans. Resolving this conflict requires an understanding of the factors that cause large carnivores to select livestock over wild prey. Individual studies to date report contradictory results about whether wild prey density affects livestock depredation by large carnivores.
   2. We carried out a systematic review of grey wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences. We reviewed and analysed 119 grey wolf dietary studies from 27 countries to determine whether wild prey or livestock density affects grey wolf dietary selection.
   3. We also assessed whether there are traits that predispose species to be preyed upon (body size, group size, defence mechanisms, speed), and whether livestock management is a factor that affects selection of livestock by grey wolves.
   4. Overall, wild prey (65% of the total frequency of occurrence in all reviewed grey wolf diet studies) was selected for even when livestock was abundant. The average proportion of biomass percentage in grey wolf diets was 13% for livestock and 19% for wild species.
   5. Wild prey species in possession of defence mechanisms (horns, antlers, spikes, and fangs), with high body weight and present in high density were more likely to be depredated by grey wolves.
   6. Even when prey abundance significantly affected selection of wild prey, livestock predation was much lower considering their substantially higher density. Areas where livestock were left to graze freely in small numbers (<20 individuals/km(2)) were more vulnerable to grey wolf attacks.
   7. Our results suggest that the adoption of attack prevention measures on pastures and the increase of wild prey abundance could reduce depredation on livestock by grey wolves, and in turn, provide better opportunities for coexistence between humans, grey wolves and livestock.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming a standard tool in environmental monitoring that aims to quantify spatiotemporal variation for the measurement and prediction of ecosystem change. eDNA surveys have complex workflows encompassing multiple decision-making steps in which uncertainties can accumulate due to field sampling design, molecular biology lab work, and bioinformatics analyses. We conducted a quantitative review of studies published prior to December 2017 (n = 431) that had sampled eDNA from a variety of ecosystems and that had explicitly accounted for variability and uncertainty associated with eDNA workflows, either in their study design (e.g., replication) or data analysis (e.g., statistically modeling the spatiotemporal variation). We recorded differences among research studies in their spatial and temporal study design, the detected scales of natural variation in the study taxa, and how researchers measured and addressed the multiple sources of variability and uncertainty associated with the eDNA workflow. We show that relatively few studies used eDNA to understand temporal variation in biodiversity compared to spatial variation, and fewer described how uncertainties were addressed. We recommend increasing the number of temporal studies and to account for both natural variation and sources of uncertainty, such as imperfect detection, when undertaking eDNA surveys. Of studies that quantified spatiotemporal variation, this review identified gaps in the scales over which researchers have observed these patterns. Increasing the number of long-term and broad-scale eDNA studies will improve understanding of how useful eDNA is at scales relevant for monitoring the effects of environmental changes such as climatic shifts or land use change. Even where sources of spatiotemporal variation and uncertainty were accounted for, the effort in quantifying this variation differed among the different steps in the eDNA process, from field, to laboratory and bioinformatics procedures, depending on the type of community studied (micro- vs. macro-organism communities). We recommend more consistent experimental and modeling methods, accounting for spatiotemporal variation, and uncertainty in eDNA collection, and analysis, and incorporation of prior knowledge of sources of variability via Bayesian modeling approaches to account for uncertainties such as imperfect detection, to generate robust diversity estimates and increase the comparability of eDNA datasets for environmental monitoring across space and time.

AB  - Intensification of agriculture and ongoing urban sprawl exacerbate pressures on rivers. Small rivers in agricultural landscapes are especially exposed to excessive technical actions implemented in order to allow for harvesting river water for irrigation, draining agricultural water and receiving sewage. Regular dredging and macrophyte removal strongly interfere with the global need for preserving river biodiversity that allows agricultural lowland rivers to remain refuges for a variety of species, and-accordingly-to keep water bodies resilient for the benefit of society. In order to provide a comprehensive look at the influence of agricultural lowland river management on the ecological status of these water bodies, we conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis. For the structured literature review we selected 203 papers reflecting on the response of aquatic ecosystems to dredging and macrophyte management actions. The database of scientific contributions developed for our study consists of papers written by the authors from 33 countries (first authorship) addressing dredging, macrophyte removal, status of fish and macroinvertebrates as well as the general ecological status of lowland agricultural rivers. We revealed that 96% of the analyzed papers indicated unilateral, negative responses of aquatic ecosystems, particularly macroinvertebrates, ichthyofauna and macrophyte composition, to maintenance measures. We revealed that studies conducted in the European Union on the ecological status of rivers appeared to significantly increase in quantity after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Finally, we concluded that day-to-day management of lowland agricultural rivers requires revision in terms of compliance with environmental conservation requirements and the recurrent implementation of technical measures for river maintenance.

AB  - Forest thinning has been used as a management tool to reverse the adverse impacts of decades of fire suppression in the western USA. Research into the impacts of thinning on surface water, soil, and vegetation re-growth have occurred concurrently with the growing popularity of forest thinning; however, its potential impact on groundwater recharge and related springs ecosystems has largely been ignored until recently. This systematic review provides an overview of some of the tools used to measure the influence of forest management on groundwater recharge, including numerical and process based modeling, empirical paired-watershed approaches, and statistical stochastic techniques. A brief discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each method also is provided. The paper provides a literature review of existing studies of groundwater recharge and forest management from 1971 to 2018. The review of 35 studies indicates a range of results and highlights differences between studies of clear-cut forests versus thinned forests. Forests that were thinned had a greater amount of groundwater recharge than clear-cut forests, indicating that recharge responds positively and more strongly to reduced sublimation and evaporation in partially thinned forests than to clear-cut removal of mature trees. A similar test with forest encroachment studies revealed no differences between forest encroachment and either thinning regime. The number of forest management-groundwater recharge studies has dramatically increased over the last two decades, indicating increased interest in finding tools to increase groundwater yields for societal use in rapidly populating aridland forests. To our knowledge there have been no studies of forest thinning impacts on springs ecosystems, a field of study rich with possibilities for ecologists, hydrologists, rangeland and forestry scientists, and interdisciplinary ecohydrology practitioners.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted of biological and physical climate change impacts in three hotspot regions in Africa and Asia. Specifically, the review focused on identifying the nature and extent of biophysical impacts in semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and glacial-fed river basins. In total 139, peer-reviewed articles were reviewed, with a steady increase in relevant articles reported since 2006. Publications on the South Asian glacial-fed river basins were the most numerous followed by semi-arid areas and then deltas, with Central Asia and some African countries being the most under represented. The nature and extent of impacts varied for each hotspot area and were largely determined by the geographical context and intrinsic characteristics of each region. River basin publications were dominated by impacts concerning hydrology, highlighting the importance of glacial-fed water resources to downstream populations. Semi-arid regions were dominated by impacts to climate processes and impacts to livestock and vegetation highlighting the importance of rainfall to the ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities in these regions. In contrast, delta studies were dominated by a focus on hazards, predominantly coastal inundation, reflecting the concentration of populations and assets in these areas. Uncertainties associated with the biophysical impacts on these regions under a changing climate are documented and represent key knowledge gaps. Common information gaps for all hotspot regions were the need for improved hydro-meteorological monitoring systems. The development of climate change adaptation strategies and policies should be supported by a sound knowledge and understanding of the full range of biophysical impacts, which are characteristic to each geographical location.

AB  - Climate change is regarded as one of the greatest challenges to cities in the future. Some proposals focus on incorporating urban green space to counter the rise in temperature and ensuing public health hazards. Urban blue spaces, defined as all surface waters within a city, are regarded as a possible factor for temperature mitigation, but effects have not been quantified and so remain underrepresented in research, recommendations for action and planning. A systematic review was conducted of studies quantifying the temperature-mitigating effects of urban blue compared to other urban sites (n=27). The studies included in the review measured air temperatures at various types of urban blue space such as ponds, lakes or rivers and compared them with reference sites at defined distances or to urban reference sites in the same city. The meta-analysis suggested that a cooling effect of 2.5 K (CI 95% 1.9-3.2 K, p<0.01) during the warmest months on northern hemisphere (between May and October) can be attributed to urban blue sites when including remote sensing data. However, research on the air temperature effects of urban blue space remains sparse compared to studies on urban green. The cooling effects clearly attributable to urban blue space are limited by surrounding environmental conditions like microclimate, urban development, wind velocity, wind turbulence, wind direction, temperature and humidity. Future research is needed to help planners use urban blue space efficiently as a temperature-mitigating and health protecting and promoting factor. The temperature-mitigating capacity of urban blue can potentially reduce heat stress in urban areas. To create healthy environments in the cities of the future, a better understanding of health affecting aspects of urban blue is needed to initiate public health action.

AB  - ObjectivesEffective healthcare systems require high-quality research to guide evidence-based interventions and strategic planning. In low- and middle-income countries, especially those emerging from violent conflict, research capacity often lags behind other aspects of health system development. Here, we sought to bibliometrically review health-related research output in Somaliland, a post-conflict self-declared, autonomous nation on the Horn of Africa, as a means of assessing research capacity.
   MethodsWe reviewed articles on health-related research conducted in Somaliland between 1991 and 2013 that included a description of the experimental design, and articles were published in either a peer-reviewed journal or as part of a scholarly programme receiving formal review. We did not include policy or social science research that did not enrol or interact with subjects from Somaliland. Using online databases, all studies meeting minimum eligibility criteria were reviewed in regard to Somaliland-based co-authorship, topic of research and specific measures of quality.
   ResultsA total of 37 studies were included in this review. Of these, only 19 (51%) included co-authorship by Somaliland-based researchers. Of the 21 studies reporting ethical approval, 16 (64%) received approval from the Somalia or Somaliland Ministry of Health, while five received approval from a university or national commission. More than two-thirds of published research was limited to a few areas of investigation with most (19, 51%) following basic cross-sectional study designs. The number of articles published per year increased from 0 to 1 in the years 1991-2007 to a maximum of 8 in 2013.
   ConclusionsResearch activity in Somaliland is extremely limited. Investigators from high-income countries have largely directed the research agenda in Somaliland; only half of the included studies list co-authors from institutions in Somaliland. Leadership and governance of health research in Somaliland is required to define national priorities, promote scholarly activity and guide the responsible conduct of research. The methods used here to assess research capacity may be generalisable to other low- and middle-income countries and post-conflict settings to measure the impact of research capacity-building efforts.

AB  - Background: Health and social care education is highly important for preparing future professionals for their future roles in sustainable health and social care. However, previous studies have emphasized that health and social care educators' competence is complex and poorly defined. Thus, there is a clear need for a psychometrically validated instrument to enable clarification and assessment of the required skills.
   Objective: To develop and psychometrically validate an instrument (the HeSoEduCo) for assessing health and social care educators' competence in higher and professional education.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: A HeSoEduCo instrument, with items inviting 1-4 Likert scale responses, was developed, based on one systematic review and one qualitative study, then validated in terms of face, content and construct validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha values). All health and social care educators based in all 21 universities of applied sciences in Finland and seven vocational colleges were subsequently invited to participate in a large-scale application of the instrument in fall 2018. In total, responses of 390 of these educators are analyzed here.
   Results: The face and content validity of 71 newly developed items were assessed by experts in two evaluation rounds. The final content validity showed high scores for the instrument's relevance and clarity. Confirmatory factor analysis (to test construct validity) yielded eight factors (43-items remaining), defining the following competence areas of educators: evidence-based practice, digital collaborative learning, student-centered pedagogy, collaboration & societal, leadership & management, cultural & linguistic diversity, mentoring student into professional competence development and subject & curriculum. Cronbach's alpha values for the factors ranged from 0.70 to 0.89.
   Conclusion: The instrument can be used to obtain self-evaluations of educators' competence when assessing their general competence levels and help human resources departments and managers to identify suitable continuous education programs for their staff.

AB  - Understanding the areas used by migratory marine animals and their movements is critical in supporting management decisions that target their conservation. This is especially important for long-lived species with large geographic extents and are more vulnerable to multiple threats. We conducted a literature review on data collected for 173 marine mammal, marine fish, sea turtle, and seabird species and determined that tracking animal movements with telemetry methods was the most effective tool for demonstrating ecological connec-tivity. From the references included for review, we found more references for sea turtles than other taxa, and more information was collected for all four taxa in the northern hemisphere. In addition, 30 % of references presented methods to process the raw telemetry tracks, only 11 % of references mentioned a repository for archiving data, and there was no significant trend in the number of references and current conservation level. For four case study species (Atlantic bluefin tuna, humpback whale, loggerhead sea turtle, and wandering albatross), we found more information published for adults and on the descriptions of sites focused on feeding and breeding activities, while sites used for migration and connectivity among areas used for migration were not well rep-resented. Although connectivity data were published for most of the migratory marine species we reviewed, several knowledge gaps existed and there were limitations of the data presented within publications for direct applications to area-based management. We provided recommendations to address research gaps and guidance to improve the integration of connectivity data into area-based management decisions.

AB  - The overall growth of the world's population and urbanization lead to rethinking transport planning, further developing the conventional transport systems, and complementing new ones usefully, especially in urban environments. One way to cope with this challenge is to leave behind the already severely saturated urban land use model and move to the third dimension. This includes the use of urban aerial cable cars, which can complement conventional public transport in certain transport relations. Accordingly, this paper aims to answer how the recent, past, or planned implementations of urban aerial cable cars are assessed in the scientific literature, what open research questions need to be answered to enhance the success of transport systems, and what the chances are of cable cars becoming a standard part of transport planners' repertoires. Following systematic literature review methods, 54 studies from different databases were identified and processed in a multi-stage procedure to provide transparent insight into the relevant literature. The results, especially concerning urban and transport integration, are discussed in detail, emphasizing that cable cars have already partially found their niche, but their role in the urban environment has not yet been sufficiently studied. In conclusion, the study's originality fills the gap in providing a review of urban aerial cable cars from a transport planning perspective by systematically considering today's globally available literature.

AB  - Pasta, bread, and bakery products are considered worldwide as essential foods for human nutrition. In particular, ancient wheats and whole wheat flours, despite being able to provide health benefits via bioactive compounds, present significant technological problems related to poorer dough rheological properties and final product characteristics. Moreover, both the food industry and consumers are increasingly sensitive to environmental impacts, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable innovations and improvement strategies, from cradle to grave, for the entire production chains, thus motivating this review. The aim of this review is to provide technological innovations and improvement strategies to increase the sustainability, productivity, and quality of flours, pasta, bread, and bakery products. This review is focused on the main operations of the production chains (i.e., wheat cultivation, wheat milling, dough processing, and, finally, the manufacturing of pasta, bread, and bakery products). To achieve this goal, the use of life-cycle assessment (LCA) analysis proved to be an effective tool that can be used, from early stages, for the development of eco-friendly improvement strategies. The correct management of the wheat cultivation stage was found to be essential since it represents the most impacting phase for the environment. Successively, particular attention needs to be paid to the milling process, the kneading phase, to breadmaking, and, finally, to the manufacturing of pasta. In this review, several specifically developed solutions for these essential phases were suggested. In conclusion, despite further investigations being necessary, this review provided several innovations and improvement strategies, using an approach "from cradle to grave", able to increase the sustainability, productivity, and final quality of flour, semolina, pasta, bread, and bakery products.

AB  - A major public health challenge facing local administrations is reducing the preventable burden of noncommunicable diseases making cities more resilient against environmental threats. The objective of this work was to conduct a synthesis of scientific evidence relating to the local context and implement a translational process to support the Department of the Environment in order to improve integration with concurrent policy sectors to urban health and sustainability goals. The first phase reviewed the studies on the association between environmental risk factors and human health and on the contamination levels of the environmental matrices; the second phase synthesised the data in key messages according to the concerns formulated with the collaboration of the Environmental Department. A total of 31 studies were assessed: 21 investigated environmental risk factors, and 9 measured the presence of pollutants in the environmental matrices. The findings identified air and noise pollution as the most important threats associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, together with significant contamination levels of the urban environment from microplastics and hydrocarbons. Based on the review findings, a layman's report for the City Council and the citizens, explicitly addressing emerging issues, was made publicly accessible. A lack of specific, updated and exchangeable data for city health profiling in a deteriorated environmental context represented the main barrier to a resilient community. The suggested recommendation for the local administration was to adopt an environmental policy integration framework to strengthen the monitoring of the impact on citizens' health.

AB  - Several agro-waste materials have been utilized for sustainable engineering and environmental application over the past decades, showing different degrees of effectiveness. However, information concerning the wider use of palm oil clinker (POC) and its performance is still lacking. Therefore, as a solid waste byproduct produced in one of the oil palm processing stages, generating a huge quantity of waste mostly dumped into the landfill, the waste-to-resource potential of POC should be thoroughly discussed in a review. Thus, this paper provides a systematic review of the current research articles on the several advances made from 2005 to 2021 regarding palm oil clinker physical properties and performances, with a particular emphasis on their commitments to cost savings during environmental and engineering applications. The review begins by identifying the potential of POC application in conventional and geopolymer structural elements such as beams, slabs, and columns made of concrete, mortar, or paste for coarse aggregates, sand, and cement replacement. Aspects such as performance of POC in wastewater treatment processes, fine aggregate and cement replacement in asphaltic and bituminous mixtures during highway construction, a bio-filler in coatings for steel manufacturing processes, and a catalyst during energy generation are also discussed. This review further describes the effectiveness of POC in soil stabilization and the effect of POC pretreatment for performance enhancement. The present review can inspire researchers to find research gaps that will aid the sustainable use of agroindustry wastes. The fundamental knowledge contained in this review can also serve as a wake-up call for researchers that will motivate them to explore the high potential of utilizing POC for greater environmental benefits associated with less cost when compared with conventional materials.

AB  - Sloping farmland (SpF) is an important component of cultivated land resources. In the context of food security and sustainable agricultural development, comprehensive SpF utilization has drawn wide and increasing attentions. A systematic analysis on the research progress of comprehensive SpF utilization is critical for a better understanding of the sustainable agricultural cultivation, facilitating the macroeconomic decision-making. This paper conducted a quantitative analysis of literature related to comprehensive SpF utilization over the past few decades (1946-2019) by using scientometrics methods, with the objectives to: (1) identify the research hotspots and summarize the relevant research processes in different time periods; (2) reveal the temporal evolution of those hotspots. Our results showed: 1) research on SpF dramatically increased over the past few decades (1946-2019), which can be classified into four chronological periods (I, II, III, and IV); (2) research regarding land productivity improvement and hydrological and erosion processes on SpF were dominant in the period I; (3) the research hotspots were switched to land use changes and associated soil erosion response, ecological disturbance and restoration as the social demand was intensifying in the period II; (4) the research focus of period III was aiming at the governance and rational utilization of SpF and gradually transforming to a large regional scale; (5) the intercross and penetration between disciplines had been continuously enhanced in the period IV, and the application of high and new technologies had also promoted the diversification of research methods, with aims to achieve sustainable agricultural development. Although considerable progress had been achieved around the world, more theoretical and empirical studies are required to understand the comprehensive SpF utilization and their implications to better support sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to provide a precise understanding of how corporate sustainability information is used in socially responsible investing (SRI). The study is motivated by the lack of a recognised body of knowledge on this issue. This study, therefore, collates and reviews relevant studies (67 studies) to provide guidance to investors interested in SRI and identify a research agenda for academics desiring to contribute to this area.Design/methodology/approach - This study conducts a systemic literature review employing recognised key words and searching the Web of Science. HistCite is utilised to ensure important cited studies are not missed from the collection. The review was conducted from two perspectives: (1) sources of sustainability information and (2) how the information is used in SRI.Findings - The review identifies five major sources of sustainability information, including corporate reports, ESG ratings, industry affiliation, news and private communication with firms. These sources of information play different roles in the cross section of SRI strategies (i.e. negative and positive screening, active ownership and integration). This study provides guidance on how to use this information in SRI and provides recommendations for future research on how analysts interact with the information, how different informational characteristics impact implementation, ways to improve data quality, improvements to analysis methods and where data use needs to be extended into new strategies. Originality/value- This review contributes to the SRI literature by inventorying studies of an important, yet omitted aspect, namely, sustainability information. This work also enriches the literature on corporate sustainability information by investigating how this information can be used for a specific purpose, namely, SRI. Given the increasing interest in SRI, this review will provide much-needed guidance for a range of practitioners, including investors and regulators.

AB  - Environmental change and anthropogenic pressure are primary drivers of biodiversity loss, particularly in wetland ecosystems that have been modified significantly. Among wetland specialists, mammals may be particularly vulnerable to extinction. We aimed to increase understanding of threats and knowledge gaps faced by 11 mammal species inhabiting wetlands throughout India.
   We adopted a systematic literature search protocol following an evidence-based conservation approach to obtain information on conservation threats and identify knowledge gaps for each species. Each species received threat scores based on the occurrence and magnitude of ecological and anthropogenic threats, a score based on its International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List category, and a knowledge gap score. A cumulative conservation threat score based on the four individual scores was calculated for each species to assess overall conservation threats.
   Only about 10% of the literature search results were relevant. Of the major research categories, ecology was the most well-studied, whereas the impact of anthropogenic pressure on wetland mammals was the least studied. Pressing ecological and anthropogenic threats, scientific knowledge gaps, and conservation needs contributed to a high cumulative threat score for the sangai Rucervus eldii eldii (cumulative threat score = 34), followed by the wild Asian buffalo Bubalus arnee (threat score = 33) and the Bengal marsh mongoose Herpestes palustris (threat score = 32). Poaching/hunting, habitat loss due to development, and changes in land-use practices were found to be the major anthropogenic threats resulting in decreasing population trends. We identified knowledge gaps concerning the ecology of wetland mammals (e.g. population abundance). It is essential that these knowledge gaps are filled for effective conservation planning.
   We identified important areas (population ecology, disease ecology, human-wildlife conflict, changes in land use) that should be considered as research priorities for wetland mammals in India, in order to make conservation efforts more effective and enable management planning, to ensure the long-term survival of these mammals.

AB  - Tropical regions are experiencing rapid rates of forest fragmentation, which can have several effects on wildlife, including altered parasite dynamics. Bats are a useful host group to consider the effects of fragmentation, because they are abundant in the tropics, serve important ecological roles, and harbor many parasites. Nevertheless, research on the effects of fragmentation on bat ectoparasites is still limited. To help guide ongoing and future research efforts, this study had two objectives: (1) conduct a gap analysis to characterize the state of currently available research on fragmentation effects on bat ectoparasites and (2) conduct a preliminary meta-analysis to identify current trends. We systematically highlighted several research gaps: Studies comparing the effects of fragmented versus continuous forests on ectoparasites are limited and have primarily been conducted in the Neotropics, with a focus on bats in the superfamily Noctilionidea (especially frugivorous phyllostomids). Our preliminary meta-analysis suggested that ectoparasite prevalence (but not the mean or variance in intensity) was higher in fragments than in continuous forests. Moreover, prevalence increased with increasing roost duration, and mean intensity was higher for bats with higher wing aspect ratios. Intensity variance was affected by an interaction between forest type and wing aspect ratio, such that variance increased for bats with high-wing aspect ratios in continuous forests but decreased in fragments. These results suggest that fragmentation can shape aspects of bat ectoparasitism and could have implications for the ecology, health, and conservation of bats in fragmented landscapes. However, existing research gaps could bias our current understanding of habitat change and bat health, and future research should thus investigate these effects in the Paleotropics and with other bat families.

AB  - Urbanization-induced atmospheric moisture changes, embodied as urban moisture island (UMI) and urban dry island (UDI) effects, are not as thoroughly understood as the urban heat island (UHI) effects, despite their significant influence on human comfort and well-being. This paper offers the first systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of global urban-rural humidity contrasts, aiming to advance our comprehension of the mechanisms, intensity, patterns, and implications of urban humidity changes. The meta-analysis compiles observational data from 34 studies across 33 cities. It reveals that mid-latitude cities predominantly exhibit moderate UMI and UDI effects, and cities with low mean annual precipitation and distinct dry/wet seasons, however, exhibit extreme UMI and UDI effects. The diurnal cycle analysis presents more pronounced UMI effects at night, largely due to increased evapotranspiration and delayed dewfall linked with UHI. On a seasonal scale, UDI effects dominate in spring, while UMI effects peak in winter for mid-latitude cities and in summer for low-latitude cities. In addition, city characteristics such as topography, morphology, and size significantly shape urban-rural humidity contrasts. Coastal cities are subject to sea-breeze circulation, importing moisture from sea to land, whereas mountainous cities can accumulate humidity and precipitation due to geographical barriers and vertical airflow. High-density urban areas generally experience heightened UMI effects due to restricted airflow and ventilation. Larger cities with higher populations contribute to increased UMI effects, particularly in winter, due to stronger anthropogenic moisture sources. This paper also discusses multi-dimensional humidity impacts and strategies for humidity-sensitive urban planning in the context of climate change. It identifies critical gaps in current research, paving the way for future exploration into urban humidity changes.

AB  - The environmental effects of conventional fossil fuels used in maritime sector is a well-studied subject and various methods, i.e. hull optimization, engine modifications, alternative propulsion systems, and alternative energy sources, have been suggested and implemented for years to reduce these effects. Although the utilization of alternative fuels is accepted as the most effective method, these fuels have their disadvantages as well as advantages they provide. This study mainly aims to evaluate the alternatives (ammonia, biofuels, dimethyl ether, ethanol, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and methanol) through a comprehensive literature review. For this purpose, the publications obtained from Web of Science were searched using the keyword alternative marine fuels and the studies accessed were evaluated. In this context, the study is one of the most comprehensive reviews on alternative marine fuels and aims to discuss the future of alternative fuels through the evaluation of existing studies. The properties of these fuels have been examined in detail, taking care not to miss any point. Driving forces and obstacles for alternative fuels to be called conventional fuels have been evaluated in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. In light of the gathered information, it has been concluded that the global-scale use of alternative fuels is still at an early stage due to several major concerns, i.e. technical and environmental incompatibilities, cost issues, and insufficient training level of seafarers, and that future studies should be carried out, especially within the life cycle perspective.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a key limiting factor in crop growth and essential for agriculture. As plant uptake of P is inefficient, it is commonly applied to maintain crop yields leading to a range of negative environmental issues when applied in excess. Additionally, P in mineral fertilisers is derived from mined rock phosphate, which is a finite resource that needs to be sustainably managed in order to maintain food security in the long-term.
   Phosphatase activity is one of several mechanistic responses to P deficiency in the plant-soil system, enabling the mineralization of organic P to increase P availability for both plants and soil organisms. In this study we address the need to further understanding of the role of phosphatase enzyme activity in P acquisition in agri-cultural settings, using a systematic review of the literature and subsequent meta-analysis.
   We find that monoesterase activity is inhibited by availability of inorganic P (-23%,-39.8 to-2.2%) yet is enhanced by the availability of organic P (+74%, 8.4-232.1%). This indicates that phosphatase enzyme activity is important in P deficient agricultural systems, yet that the availability of organic P is more important in determining phosphatase activity than the level of P deficiency. We also investigated the role of other factors such as nitrogen addition, pH of growth substrate and changes in plant composition and physiology but, none of these factors explained significant variance in the data. We highlight need for consistent recording and reporting of additional variables in association with phosphatase enzyme assay data, which is required to enable quantification of the potential utilisation of organic P resources in agriculture, and the contribution of phosphatase activity to P acquisition in both agricultural and semi-natural ecosystems.

AB  - Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists.

AB  - The epidemiology of facial trauma may vary widely across countries (and even within the same country), and is dependent on several cultural and socioeconomic factors. We know of few reviews of published reports that have considered the sex distribution and aetiology of maxillofacial trauma throughout the world. The aim of this review was to discuss these aspects as they have been presented in papers published during the last 30 years. We made a systematic review of papers about the epidemiology of maxillofacial trauma that were published between January 1980 and December 2013 and identified 69 studies from Africa (n=9), North America and Brazil (n=6), Asia (n=36), Europe (n=16), and Oceania (n=2). In all the studies men outnumbered women, the ratio usually being more than 2:1. In American, African, and Asian studies road traffic crashes were the predominant cause. In European studies the aetiology varied, with assaults and road traffic crashes being the most important factors. In Oceania assaults were the most important. A comparison of the incidence of maxillofacial trauma of different countries together with a knowledge of different laws (seat belts for drivers, helmets for motocyclists, speed limits, and protection worn during sports and at work) is crucial to allow for improvement in several countries. To our knowledge this paper is the first attempt to study and compare the aetiologies of maxillofacial trauma. (C) 2014 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

KW  - OECD indicator
AB  - Effective stakeholder engagement is vital for sustainable water management in the Bogota River Basin, which faces serious environmental and socio-economic challenges, including water scarcity, pollution, and inequitable distribution. Engaging diverse stakeholders can promote shared decision-making, identify common goals, and enhance the implementation of sustainable water governance strategies. Taking this into account, this research evaluates multi-stakeholder engagement in the Bogota River Basin in Colombia over the past 30 years to promote sustainable water management in the face of current global challenges. The research methodology includes a desk-based and systematic review, as well as policy analysis using descriptive and quantitative methods. With the use of MAXQDA software, we identified 74 national, regional, and local policies focused on stakeholder engagement for water management in Colombia, which were narrowed down to 22 documents for the Bogota River Basin. The policy analysis is based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicator for Principle 10 to self-assess the level of legal framework implementation and stakeholder engagement. The self-assessment pointed out that despite the strong legal background and the enhancement of stakeholder engagement via formal and informal participatory mechanisms in the first stages of policy-making, there is a lack of engagement in the evaluation and follow-up phases, leading to box-ticking mechanisms. The findings suggest that effective stakeholder engagement needs to be comprehensive in policy-making processes, especially in the evaluation and follow-up stages. Moreover, the river basin's management can improve by making a clear disclosure about the outcomes of participatory processes. This research concludes that promoting shared decision-making, identifying common goals, and enhancing the implementation of sustainable water management strategies can greatly benefit the Bogota River Basin. These efforts can lead to more effective and efficient use of water resources and ultimately contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment.

AB  - Introduction: Environmental compensation is a technical-legal instrument of environmental management used to offset damage due to non-reversible and unavoidable impacts. Usually, offset regulations are included in national environmental legislations. This paper summarizes environmental compensation legislation in Costa Rica, a country with a recognized conservation tradition and environmental awareness. Our goal is to describe how compensation is formulated in that country and identify possible regulations gaps. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of environmental legislation through the Costa Rican Legal Information System (http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/avanzada_pgr.aspx), considering both regulations and pronouncements on compensation measures and mitigation. Results: The Political Constitution of Costa Rica recognizes a healthy environment as a fundamental right for all citizens. At least seven laws dealing with environmental issues and their respective regulations are currently enforced. This bulky legislation aims to protect natural resources by regulating their use and creating an assem-blage of protected wild areas. However, the legislation is somewhat repetitive and open to interpretation, facili-tating confusion. Actions requiring compensation are regulated in a general way, making it difficult to establish when and how to apply them. In addition, compensation is considered based on when the damage is identified and not on its level of environmental impact. Furthermore, the regulations do not make explicit the principles and goals that support the compensatory measures or how they should be carried out, briefly mentioning some actions that do not ensure that the net environmental loss is zero. Conclusions: This review reveals the need to standardize the mechanisms to determine compensatory measures at the regulatory level, also analyzing the strategies that will be followed to ensure proportionality and ecological equivalence. The legislation must emphasize the importance of compensation as a positive practice, which must be incorporated within the guidelines of the Environmental Impact Study.

AB  - The welfare of animals in food-production systems is a cause of concern to the public. Regenerative agriculture was first used by the Rodale Institute and proposes to regenerate degraded components of ecosystems, aiming to be more than just sustainable. However, despite animal welfare being pushed to be part of the SDG agenda for 2030, there is no clarity on how regenerative agriculture impacts animal welfare. It is challenging to determine regenerative agriculture impacts on animal welfare, since it is not entirely defined. One Welfare could help define entry points for future research by studying animal welfare in connection with human welfare and environmental conservation. We aimed to analyse the extent to which positive animal welfare outcomes characterise regenerative agriculture systems in peer-reviewed articles and whether the narratives of such articles support that regenerative agriculture promotes animal welfare directly or indirectly by improving human welfare and environmental conservation. We searched papers including 'regenerative agriculture' using PRISMA-P, selecting animal welfare, human welfare, environment conservation terms, developed themes, and carried out analysis using Atlas.Ti8 and Causal Loop Diagram. We found that papers mainly linked animal welfare to animal health, human welfare to financial farm status and farmer's self-awareness, and environmental conservation to soil improvement. Causal Loop Diagram indicated that regenerative agriculture had the potential to improve the health and nutrition components of animal welfare by enhancing financial farmers' status/self-awareness (human welfare), and the soil (environmental conservation), reflecting that the processes that affect human welfare and environmental conservation could also affect animal welfare. However, information in papers remains insufficient to determine how regenerative agriculture impacts on animal welfare and research into regenerative agriculture needs to extend its focus on animal welfare and elucidate the regenerative agriculture principles leading to animal welfare.

AB  - As the sole opportunity for most plants to move, seed dispersal influences the biodiversity and functioning of plant communities. Global change drivers have the potential to disrupt seed dispersal processes, affecting plant communities and ecosystem functions. Even though much information is available on the effects of seed dispersal disruption (SDD), we still lack a comprehensive understanding of its main causes at a global scale, as well as the potential knowledge gaps derived from research biases. Here we present a systematic review of biotic and abiotic SDDs to ascertain the global change drivers addressed, dispersal modes impacted, plant processes affected, and spatial focus of existing research on this topic up-to-date. Although there are many modes of dispersal and global change drivers in temperate and tropical ecosystems worldwide, research efforts have predominantly addressed the effect of alien species for biotic seed dispersal in temperate systems and oceanic islands as well as how defaunation of bird or mammal dispersers has affected seed removal in the Neotropics. SDD studies were also biased toward forest ecosystems, with few in shrublands or grasslands. Finally, the effects of climate change, ecological consequences at the whole community level, and evolutionary changes were largely unrepresented in SDD studies. These trends are likely due to a combination of true geographic and ecological patterns in seed dispersal and global change and bias in research focus. We conclude that increased research investment in the less-studied systems and a better understanding of potential synergies and feedback between multiple global change drivers will be important to forecast the threats to plant biodiversity and those ecosystem functions derived from seed dispersal in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Sustainability has increasingly gained momentum as an underlying framework to orient decisions and actions in environmental management. However, while acting in view of sustainability goals is a noble intention, both the conceptualization and the implementation of sustainability remain a subject of debate. This is partly due to the widespread lack of consideration for its social dimension and the interactions this has with the environmental and economic dimensions. To this end, the Community Capitals Framework and other asset-based approaches are often used to deal with these problematic aspects of sustainability in environmental management. Through a systematic review of scientific peer-reviewed articles, this paper investigates the conceptual and practical application of such approaches. Results from our analysis show that different declinations of community capitals exist within environmental management. In all the forms they assume in the 42 frameworks identified, their employment seems effective in promoting the inclusion of social, economic and environmental dimensions when conducting sustainability assessments. However, we identified two main difficulties that challenge the appli-cation of asset-based approaches in practice. First, in most cases, capital assessment is not carried out in the planning phase of an environmental intervention in order to identify community resources; capitals are employed instead to measure the impact of an ecological change ex-post, thus being discordant with their theoretical foundations. Second, the existence of a vast array of terms to refer to community assets creates disorientation among exponents of different stakeholder groups and hinders a practical and effective application of this concept. On the basis of our results, we claim the importance of conducting community resources assessment and stakeholder consultation at different times and through practice oriented approaches and cross -silos communication efforts in order to develop a shared understanding of the problem and facilitate sustainable, adaptive and participatory approaches to environmental management

AB  - Objectives: Existing assertions about the relationship between various factors of the built environment and physical activity behaviors are inconsistent and warrant further exploration and analysis. Methods: This study systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for the effect of the built environment on the physical activity behaviors of older adults. R software was used to calculate the meta-estimated odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Simultaneously, the quality of included studies was evaluated using an observational study quality evaluation standard recommended by American health care quality and research institutions. Results: A total of 16 original researches were included in this meta-analysis and eight factors of the built environment were evaluated. These factors which ranked from high to low according to their impact were traffic safety (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.14-2.20]), destination accessibility (OR = 1.24, 95% CI [1.06-1.44]), aesthetics of sports venues (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.07-1.37]), virescence of sports venues (OR = 1.14, 95% CI [1.06-1.23]), building density (OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.02-1.13]). Additionally, it seemed that there was no potential association between mixed land 95% CI [0.92-1.08]) or commercial facilities (OR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.88-1.00]) and physical activity behaviors of older adults. Conclusions: The built environment has been found to exhibit a significant relationship with the physical activity behaviors of older adults. It is proposed that factors such as traffic safety, destination accessibility, aesthetics of sports venues, virescence of sports venues, and building density be given more consideration when aiming to promote physical activity levels among older adults.

AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by unprecedented and increasing anthropogenic pressures, including habitat loss and fragmentation. LiDAR can become a decisive technology by providing accurate information about the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Here, we review the current use of LiDAR metrics in ecological studies regarding birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, bryophytes, lichens, and fungi (BLF). We quantify the types of research (ecosystem and LiDAR sources) and describe the LiDAR platforms and data that are currently available. We also categorize and harmonize LiDAR metrics into five LiDAR morphological traits (canopy cover, height and vertical distribution, understory and shrubland, and topographic traits) and quantify their current use and effectiveness across taxonomic groups and ecosystems. The literature review returned 173 papers that met our criteria. Europe and North America held most of the studies, and birds were the most studied group, whereas temperate forest was by far the most represented ecosystem. Globally, canopy height was the most used LiDAR trait, especially in forest ecosystems, whereas canopy cover and terrain topography traits performed better in those ecosystems where they were mapped. Understory structure and shrubland traits together with terrain topography showed high effectiveness for less studied groups such as BLF and invertebrates and in open landscapes. Our results show how LiDAR technology has greatly contributed to habitat mapping, including organisms poorly studied until recently, such as BLF. Finally, we discuss the forthcoming opportunities for biodiversity mapping with different LiDAR platforms in combination with spectral information. We advocate (i) for the integration of spaceborne LiDAR data with the already available airborne (airplane, drones) and terrestrial technology, and (ii) the coupling of it with multispectral/hyperspectral information, which will allow for the exploration and analyses of new species and ecosystems.

AB  - Variations due to climate change like rising sea levels, recurring storm surges and changing wave conditions coupled with unsustainable development along the coast are exacerbating coastal populations' vulnerability to coastal dangers globally. The ecosystem based solution to achieve sustainable development is increasingly advocated in the last two decades to leverage nature's robust adaptive capacity to change and protect people against its negative consequences. Mangroves protect and maintain a rich marine biodiversity in the tropics and subtropics and are crucial carbon sinks. The present study thus analyses mangroves' role as ecosystem-based technique to reduce disaster risk and adapt to climate change using Mauritius, a small island state, as case study, particularly the coastal protective and climate change adaptive capacities of the two local species Rhizophora mucronata Lam. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to retrieve resources from Google Scholar, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for the 2002 to 2022 period. A total of 41,789 records were identified and through a robust screening and filtering process only 50 studies were deemed relevant to the present study. In this context, key attributes of mangrove forests were found to be in reducing coastal flood risk, sheltering coastal regions during storms and stabilizing the coast. This study lays the foundation to consider Rhizophora and Brugueira as robust nature based solutions for Mauritius which will be of key importance to decision makers, researchers and the public at large to consider restoring degraded mangrove sites and promote ecosystem-based approaches to reduce disaster risk, adapt to climate change, enhance marine spatial planning and better coastal zone management.

AB  - In the last decade, there have been significant developments in the field of intelligent energy management systems (IEMSs), with various methods and new solutions proposed for managing the energy resources intelligently. An important issue related to finding the desired outcomes remains unexplored, i.e., how to determine key insights from the sparse academic literature in the age of digital publishing. To mitigate the issue, this study proposes a novel strategy to systematically survey the relevant studies by converting the sparse literature into visual presentations. We first apply a systematic approach called a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) statement to provide the insights from the published literature of the past decade (2010-2020). Then, VOSviewer experiments are conducted to transform these sparse scholarly data into visual representations. In total, eighty-one papers published in high-impact journals are identified based on their scientific soundness and relevance, and a VOSviewer analysis is applied. The analysis revealed the existence of three research clusters focused on the following main thematic areas: the energy management in smart homes and smart grids (35 journal papers); the emerging concept of context-awareness (26 journal papers); and the role of privacy preservation in IEMSs (20 journal papers). This analysis uncovers the current state of IEMSs and explores existing issues, methods, findings, and gaps. Thus, future research directions have been recommended to fill the existing gaps. This systematic literature review is to assist both researchers and industry practitioners to understand the research gaps of previous studies.

AB  - Integrating social equity considerations into analyses of the food-energy-water systems nexus (FEWS) could improve understanding of how to meet increasing resource demands without impacting social vulnerabilities. Effective integration requires a robust definition of equity and an enhanced understanding of reliable FEWS analysis methods. By exploring how equity has been incorporated into FEWS research in the United States and countries with similar national development, this systematic literature review builds a knowledge base to address a critical research need. Our objectives were to 1) catalog analysis methods and metrics relevant to assessing FEWS equity at varying scales; 2) characterize current studies and interpret shared themes; and 3) identify opportunities for future research and the advancement of equitable FEWS governance. FEWS equity definitions and metrics were categorized by respective system (food, energy, water, overall nexus) and common governance scales (local, regional, national, global). Two central issues were climate change, which increases FEWS risks for vulnerable populations, and sustainable development, which offers a promising framework for integrating equity and FEWS in policy-making contexts. Social equity in FEWS was integrated into studies through affordability, access, and sociocultural elements. This framework could support researchers and practitioners to include equity in FEWS analysis tools based on study scale, purpose, and resource availability. Research gaps identified during the review included a lack of studies effectively integrating all three systems, a need for publicly available datasets, omission of issues related to energy conversion facilities, and opportunities for integration of environmental justice modalities into FEWS research. This paper synthesized how social equity has previously been incorporated into FEWS and outlines pathways for further consideration of equity within nexus studies. Our findings suggested that continued exploration of connections between FEWS, equity, and policy development across scales could reduce social risks and vulnerabilities associated with these systems.

AB  - Under the pressures of rapid industrialization and urbanization, many Asian countries are facing the challenge of reducing air pollution and CO2 emissions simultaneously while maintaining their economic growth. Under such a circumstance, a growing attention is focused on successful implementation of co-benefit policies that are designed to reduce both air pollutants and CO2 emissions. However, the concept of co-benefit policies must be developed further in order to identify its quantitative and qualitative validity, which can be assessed using a reliable methodology for the estimation of co-benefits and through clarification of the importance of this approach for stakeholders in urban environmental policymaking. Based on a systematic review of co-benefit research and air pollution control policies in Japan, we investigated the local air pollution control policy in Kawasaki City, one of the industrial centers of Japan, and confirmed that it has contributed both to the sharp decline of atmospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels and to energy efficiency improvements in local industries. Our results suggest that preventive actions and local-scale compliance enforcement tools (that are uniquely designed and act as a form of agreement between government and individual firms) could contribute significantly to successful implementation of co-benefit policies in the long-term. We conclude our paper with a discussion of linkages between low-carbon technology innovations and policy designs that could further nurture co-benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Growing concerns about environmental issues and global warming have garnered increased attention in recent decades. Consequently, the use of materials sourced from renewable and biodegradable origins, produced sustainably, has piqued the interest of scientific researchers. Biodegradable and naturally derived polymers, such as cellulose and polylactic acid (PLA), have consistently been the focus of scientific investigation. The objective is to develop novel materials that could potentially replace conventional petroleum-based polymers, offering specific properties tailored for diverse applications while upholding principles of sustainability and technology as well as economic viability. Against this backdrop, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in research concerning the use of polylactic acid (PLA) and the incorporation of cellulose as a reinforcing agent within this polymeric matrix, alongside the application of 3D printing technology. Additionally, a pivotal additive in the combination of PLA and cellulose, polyethylene glycol (PEG), is explored. A systematic review of the existing literature related to the combination of these materials (PLA, cellulose, and PEG) and 3D printing was conducted using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The outcomes of this search are presented through a comparative analysis of diverse studies, encompassing aspects such as the scale and cellulose amount added into the PLA matrix, modifications applied to cellulose surfaces, the incorporation of additives or compatibilizing agents, variations in molecular weight and in the quantity of PEG introduced into the PLA/cellulose (nano)composites, and the resulting impact of these variables on the properties of these materials.

AB  - Introduction: Road space reallocation involves re-distributing space away from motor vehicles, including car parking and carriageway space, towards other uses. This can promote a shift to more sustainable travel modes and is likely to affect health through multiple pathways.Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment to identify and assess the potential impacts of road space reallocation on health and health inequalities in Scotland. This involved a facilitated scoping workshop to identify potential impacts, collation of routine data, interviews with 13 key informants and a rapid review of research literature.Results: We found that road space reallocation could have positive impacts on health by reducing overall levels of private motorised traffic, encouraging walking, wheeling and cycling, realising benefits from alternative uses of space and supporting local businesses. There is potential for positive impact on public transport if space is reallocated to prioritise buses, but bus users can also be disadvantaged if bus routes are diverted or stops impeded. Reallocation can improve transport and health equity if it increases support for modes other than car use, but disabled people may be disadvantaged if the reallocated space, and alternative modes, are not accessible for them.Conclusions: Road space reallocation can improve health and help reduce health inequalities. However, consideration is needed to ensure sufficient alternatives to car use are supported and the reallocated space is accessible for people with different needs. Reallocation schemes should be considered as part of a wider inclusive approach to road transport supporting active travel and public or community transport. Road space reallocation should contribute to wider place-making initiatives aiming to improve quality of local environments and meet community needs.

AB  - Agri-food waste biomass (AWB) is consolidating as a relevant bioresource for supplying material products and energy in a circular bioeconomy. However, its recovery and sustainable processing present trade-offs that must be understood. The integration of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) into life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools has emerged as a novel way to address this challenge. This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to critically synthesize how MCDA has been integrated into LCA in an assessment framework and how helpful it is in AWB's circular bioeconomy transition. The literature shows that the most studied AWBs are rice husk, sugarcane bagasse, and household food waste. These are processed through the technologies of composting, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis for applications such as biofuels, bioenergy, and soil amendment. Environmental LCA (E-LCA) is the most widely used LCA tool, while both the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for ordering preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) are the most applied techniques for MCDA. The current trend of integrating MCDA into LCA does not fully cover the LCA phases, favoring solely the impact assessment phase and indicating that the other phases are overlooked. The potential and involvement of the stakeholders are partially explored. Although there are holistic sustainability assessments, the social implications are rarely considered. The number of MCDA/LCA studies is expected to increase, assessments at the micro-, meso-, and macro-scales to become more articulated, and the impact of the results to become more aligned with government and company goals.

AB  - The mobility challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have given rise to commercial motorcycle transportation. Nonetheless, its regularisation remains a fierce contest between two categories of stakeholders: critics and protagonists. While the critics base their arguments on the safety and crime concerns associated with it, the protagonists argue based on its support for livelihoods. However, none of these arguments are grounded in the region's quest for sustainable development. Using the sustainable development prism as an analytical framework, this study unpacks the effects of commercial motorcycle transportation on the region's sustainable development efforts for evidence-based decision-making. The results of the study are based on a systematic review of literature from reputable academic databases. A synthesis of the literature reveals that commercial motorcycle transportation profoundly impacts SSA's economic and social sustainability efforts. The roles include livelihood support, revenue to governments and mobility enhancement. Nevertheless, it is associated with health and safety, security and pollution concerns. Based on these and the entrenched mobility difficulties in SSA, the authors conclude that abolishing commercial motorcycle transportation may amount to 'throwing away the baby with the bathwater'. Instead, the principle of hazard analysis and critical control point could be a valuable concept to developing risk management strategy for commercial motorcycle transportation.

AB  - Arguably the most ecologically and economically valuable pollinators worldwide, honey bees play a significant role in food production and enrich biodiversity through pollination. Varroa destructor is an invasive ectoparasitic mite that attacks and feeds on European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Because literature on the effectiveness and sustainability of various treatment modalities available for Varroa mite control in honey bee colonies are scat-tered, this scoping review was conducted to serve as a guiding document with a focus on: (1) identifying the detrimental impact Varroa mites have on the European honey bee; (2) determining current methods for Varroa mite control and their limitations; (3) examining current market landscape and key players in the pesticide market; and (4) identifying opportunities for more sustainable Varroa mite control methods. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, 397 articles published between 1998 and 2022 were screened; of which 65 articles were retained using inclusion/exclusion criteria, which were systematically analyzed in-depth, information extracted, and included in this scoping review. The results suggest that Varroa mites are one of the predominant causes of global honey bee decline as they lack natural resistance to Varroa mites, thereby negatively affecting honey bee reproduction and immunity, killing broods, and transmitting pathogenic viruses to colonies. Further, our findings suggest that: apiarists have many options for Varroa control, but no method has proven to be effective, safe and nonpersistent in the environment; adoption of nano-pesticides and development of sustainable alternatives to traditional pesticides are key drivers for growing pesticide market; and nano-pesticides may have potential to serve as an effective, safe and non-ecopersistent pesticide for Varroa mite and associated virus control. In conclusion, this review highlights an unmet need for effective and sustainable control strategies and tools for Varroa mite and virus control.

AB  - Objective To determine whether land-based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in terms of reduced joint pain or improved physical function and quality of life.
   Methods Five electronic databases were searched, up until May 2013. Randomised clinical trials comparing some form of land-based therapeutic exercise with a non-exercise control were selected. Three teams of two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study. Standardised mean differences immediately after treatment and 2-6 months after cessation of formal treatment were separately pooled using a random effects model.
   Results In total, 54 studies were identified. Overall, 19 (35%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation, allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data. However, research results may be vulnerable to selection, attrition and detection bias. Pooled results from 44 trials indicated that exercise significantly reduced pain (12 points/100; 95% CI 10 to 15) and improved physical function (10 points/100; 95% CI 8 to 13) to a moderate degree immediately after treatment, while evidence from 13 studies revealed that exercise significantly improved quality of life immediately after treatment with small effect (4 points/100; 95% CI 2 to 5). In addition, 12 studies provided 2-month to 6-month post-treatment sustainability data which showed significantly reduced knee pain (6 points/100; 95% CI 3 to 9) and 10 studies which showed improved physical function (3 points/100; 95% CI 1 to 5).
   Conclusions Among people with knee osteoarthritis, land-based therapeutic exercise provides short-term benefit that is sustained for at least 2-6 months after cessation of formal treatment.

AB  - BackgroundAustralia's National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was launched in 2013 to provide financial support packages for people with disability to purchase supports and services to enhance independence. People with disability are required to develop a plan with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), the government department responsible for managing the NDIS. This scoping review aims to ascertain the level of research into people's experience of the NDIS planning process in these geographic areas. MethodologyResearch publication databases were searched using a specific search string to identify research about people with disability and their families/carer's experiences of the NDIS planning process in regional, rural and remote regions of Australia. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was adopted to appraise the quality of the research publications. Research publications focused on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were additionally appraised using the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Quality Appraisal Tool developed by the Centre for Excellence in Aboriginal Chronic Disease Knowledge Translation and Exchange. A thematic synthesis of the publications' contents was undertaken to ascertain people with disabilities and carers experience of the NDIS planning process. ResultsTen (N = 10) research papers were found that met the inclusion criteria. Two papers were policy reviews and reported on the improvements of the NDIS planning process since its conception. The analysis found the research archive focused on five themes: (1) healthcare workforce and NDIA staff; (2) NDIS package holders and carers lack of awareness of the NDIS; (3) cultural/socio-economic barriers; (4) travel funding; and (5) emotional burden of the NDIS planning process. ConclusionThere are limited papers available that explore people's experiences of the NDIS planning process in regional, rural and remote regions of Australia. This systematic review illuminates the difficulties, barriers and concerns of people with disability and their carers about the planning process.

AB  - Background: There is a growing body of evidence that exposure to transportation related noise can adversely affect health and wellbeing. More recently, research on cardiovascular disease has specifically explored the hypothesis that exposure to transportation noise increases the risk for ischemic heart disease (IHD). Our objective was to review and conduct a meta-analysis to obtain an overall exposure-response association.
   Methods and results: We conducted a systematic review and retained published studies on incident cases of IHD using sources of transportation noise as exposure. Study-specific results were transformed into risk estimates per 10 dB increase in exposure. Subsequently we conducted a random effects meta-analysis to pool the estimates. We identified 10 studies on road and aircraft noise exposure conducted since the mid-1990s, providing a total of 12 risk estimates. Pooled relative risk for IHD was 1.06 (1.03-1.09) per 10 dB increase in noise exposure with the linear exposure-response starting at 50 dB. Based on a small number of studies, subgroup analyses were suggestive of higher risk for IHD for males compared to females (p=0.14), and for persons over 65 years of age compared to under (p=0.22). Air pollution adjustment, explored only in a subset of four studies, did not substantially attenuate the association between noise exposure and IHD.
   Conclusions: The evidence for an effect of transportation noise with IHD necessitates further research into the threshold and the shape of the exposure-response association, potential sources of heterogeneity and effect modification. Research in different cultural contexts is also important to derive regional and local estimates for the contribution of transportation noise to the global burden of disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sustainability has become an integral consideration of the dietary guidelines of many countries in recent decades. However, a lack of clear metrics and a shared approach to measuring the multiple components of sustainable diets has hindered progress toward generating the evidence needed to ensure the credibility of new guidelines. We performed a systematic literature review of empirical research studies on sustainable diets to identify the components of sustainability that were measured and the methods applied to do so. Two independent reviewers systematically searched 30 databases and other sources with the use of a uniform set of search terms and a priori exclusion criteria. In total, 113 empirical studies were included in the final review. Nearly all of the studies were focused on high-income countries. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the components of sustainability measured, the estimated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) of various dietary patterns were by far most commonly measured (n = 71 studies). Estimating the GHGEs of foods through various stages of production, use, and recycling with the use of the Life Cycle Assessment approach was the most common method applied to measure the environmental impacts of diets (n = 49 studies). Many components of sustainable diets identified in existing conceptual frameworks are disproportionately underrepresented in the empirical literature, as are studies that examine consumer demand for sustainable dietary alternatives. The emphasis in the literature on high-income countries also overlooks the production and dietary alternatives most relevant to low-and middle-income countries. We propose 3 methodological and measurement approaches that would both improve the global relevance of our understanding of sustainable diets and attend more completely to the existing multidimensional, multiscale conceptual framing of sustainable diets.

AB  - Y Objective: To assess and analyze the impact of clinical simulation as a training tool in healthcare teams ability to resolve and manage conflicts, through an exploratory systematic review.
   Methods: A structured literature review was performed with the terms clinical simulation OR patient simulation OR simulation training OR high fidelity simulation training AND conflict OR conflict resolution in the following databases: MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane, Scielo, PubMed, CINHAL, ScienceDirect, MEDES, IBECS and DOCUMED. Articles were considered if they involved clinical simulation oriented to training of healthcare professionals or trainees in conflict management, using clinical scenarios, and excluding those studies older than 20 years. Absence of debriefing was not considered an exclusion criterion, neither the use of simulation along with other methodologies. A quantitative analysis was performed.
   Results: 10 articles were retrieved, mostly with quasi-experimental designs, in which clinical simulation was designed as an interprofessional training and was used with multiple other methodologies like roleplay, reflexive practice and audiovisual aids, strategy that suggest an increase its effectivity. Different scenarios have been recreated, like decision-making divergences and management of medical errors, in order to apply the competences of mediation, communication, emotional skills among others, and followed by debriefing. The use of validated scales and conventional assessment methods reveal a positive impact on satisfaction, perception and learning of students, as well as transfer to clinical practice and decrease in errors.
   Conclusion: Multiple studies describe and support the use of clinical simulation for training in management and resolution of conflicts among healthcare professionals. Simulation is accepted by participants, developing transfer of skills and competences and impact at the organizational level. Nonetheless, studies are recent and limited in number, making this area a developing field that promotes future research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - Liveability is a term widely used in literature, but there does not appear to be a consensus around its definition. This is a problem for the water management sector who are increasingly extending the articulation of their services to capture the liveability value of water in the urban landscape. Recognising that liveability is a dynamic and multi-dimensional concept, this paper seeks to explore the differences in meaning found in the literature and highlight the context that drives them. Specifically, we ask: How has academic scholarship and broader non-academic literature conceptualised liveability and how has it been interpreted in the context of urban water management? To answer this question we conducted a systematic review of academic and non-academic liter-ature, identified attributes of liveability found therein, and looked for commonalities among different groups.
   The results show that conceptualisations of liveability differ between academic and non-academic literature but transport and connectedness emerge as central liveability themes in both. Interpretations of liveability within urban water management, on the other hand, focus primarily on the role of water in enhancing public greenspace often in the context of stormwater management and water governance.
   This paper contributes to the understanding of liveability, by identifying commonly used liveability attributes and discussing possible drivers of divergent conceptualisations of liveability: influence of policy, institutional logics of research, and growing interest in technical and engineering fields. We also discuss how distinct con-ceptualisation of liveability within urban water management can be attributed to the changes in water gover-nance and its role in enhancing public greenspace. Collectively, this suggests that more critical understanding of liveability is needed -one which recognises the heterogeneity of different conceptualisations and the external and internal context that drives them.

AB  - Over the last decades there have been a considerable number of deforestation studies in Latin America reporting lower rates compared with other regions; although these studies are either regional or local and do not allow the comparison of the intraregional variability present among countries or forest types. Here, we present the results obtained from a systematic review of 369 articles (published from 1990 to 2014) about deforestation rates for 17 countries and forest types (tropical lowland, tropical montane, tropical and subtropical dry, subtropical temperate and mixed, and Atlantic forests). Drivers identified as direct or indirect causes of deforestation in the literature were also analysed. With an overall annual deforestation rate of -1.14 (+/- 0.092 SE) in the region, we compared the rates per forest type and country. The results indicate that there is a high variability of forest loss rates among countries and forest types. In general, Chile and Argentina presented the highest deforestation rates (-3.28 and -2.31 yearly average, respectively), followed by Ecuador and Paraguay (-2.19 and -1.89 yearly average, respectively). Atlantic forests (-1.62) and tropical montane forests (-1.55) presented the highest deforestation rates for the region. In particular, tropical lowland forests in Ecuador (-2.42) and tropical dry forests in Mexico (-2.88) and Argentina (-2.20) were the most affected. In most countries, the access to markets and agricultural and forest activities are the main causes of deforestation; however, the causes vary according to the forest types. Deforestation measurements focused at different scales and on different forest types will help governments to improve their reports for international initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) but, more importantly, for developing local policies for the sustainable management of forests and for reducing the deforestation in Latin America.

AB  - Floods are one of the most common and severe natural disasters attributed to climate change that affect the globe, especially in the less-resourced countries in the global south, including those in Eastern Africa (E.A). They have been increasingly reported to occur in the past decades in E.A, and it is crucial to understand their underlying risk factors before planning their relevant mitigation interventions. In this case, drawing on the results of a rapid review conducted a priori, this study used the Haddon matrix (HM) to explore and analyze the anthropogenic drivers of floods in ten partner countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in E.A, including Burundi, Djibouti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda between 1990 and 2021. Accordingly, this study notes that the anthropogenic drivers that previously contributed to floods in the 10 partner countries of BRI in E.A were diverse, multifaceted, interrelated, and revolved around challenges of environmental degradation and encroachment on biodiversity and ecosystems, infrastructural and drainage systems, urbanization and physical planning, and socioeconomic development and the livelihood of the population. Efforts to tackle these challenges ought to be aligned with the implementation of the BRI agenda. In particular, this should draw on various opportunities contained in the BRI, as well as the Chinese success and vast experience in poverty alleviation and DRR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the HM in exploring the anthropogenic drivers of floods in the context of the BRI partner countries in the E.A and should act as a reference for further research on a similar subject matter.

AB  - Background: The wide variety of terms that converge in reverse logistics have been more evident and discussed in the current context of the literature, such as reverse channels, reverse supply chain, closed-loop supply chain, and circular supply chain. Regarding this, this paper aimed to investigate the level of uncertainty about the activities that make up the Reverse Logistics process in the opinion of professionals working in this area in Brazil, to develop a discussion relating to the sustainable development goals proposed by the UN and their importance for the future of logistics networks. Methods: Initially, through a detailed systematic review of the literature, the activities that make up the RL processes were identified. Then, a questionnaire was elaborated on regarding such activities, and a survey was developed with professionals in the area. The data obtained were analyzed through a descriptive analysis of means, calculation of Cronbach's Alpha, and using the multicriteria decision technique TOPSIS. Results: It is possible to see that professionals involved with RL processes in Brazil still have many doubts regarding which activities belong to the RL process. In the opinion of Brazilian professionals, 10 of these activities have generated high levels of uncertainties about their belonging or not to the RL process. On the other hand, with a low level of uncertainty, 3 activities were not considered and 3 were considered to make up the RL process. Conclusions: It is believed that this study can contribute to the generation of knowledge by comparing basic information in the scientific literature with the practical knowledge of professionals belonging to the reverse logistics sector working in the Brazilian context.

AB  - Previous studies show that an inequality of socioeconomic exists among the different areas in Peninsular Malaysia. On a broader scope, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) has also indicated the different levels of development among its members. SMEs are proposed as a platform to tackle the challenge. This paper discusses and comments on the factors affecting an entrepreneur's perceived success of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Further understanding of these factors will result in appropriate strategies and actions. The strategies are aimed not only for SMEs in Malaysia but also those in other ASEAN countries. The results of this study are useful to the AEC as it aims to strengthen micro, small and medium enterprises to achieve equitable economic development. The systematic review of literature is used in this research to deeper understand the dynamics of SMEs and the opportunities that come with it. This study explores the accepted definitions of SMEs in Malaysia as approved by the National SME Development Council (NSDP). Total population of 384 SMEs for food and beverage, manufacturing-related services, electrical and electronic, paper and printing in Melaka are covered for this study. Information in structured questionnaires from respondents are obtained through telephone, face to face interview and google form approaches. However, only 192 of completed questionnaires are used for the analysis. Software IBM-SPSS version 23 is used for the data analysis. Finding shows that four major factors namely demographic characteristics, entrepreneur characteristics, human capital and management, and market and product strategy have high positive correlation with SMEs' perceived success among entrepreneurs in Melaka. In conclusion, a SMEs' perceived success model is obtained and this model can be applied by other ASEAN countries for extended research on spatial SMEs perceived success comparison.

AB  - Background: Informal carers play a key supportive role for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, caring can have a considerable impact on health and wellbeing. Carers may have unidentified support needs that could be a target for intervention. Literature on the support needs of informal carers has not been fully synthesised, and our knowledge of the comprehensiveness of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool for these individuals is limited. Aim: To explore whether the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool covers the support needs of carers of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identified in published literature. Design: English language studies were identified against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria through database searching. Further studies were identified through searching reference lists and citations of included papers. Papers were critically appraised and data extracted and synthesised by two reviewers. Identified needs were mapped to Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool questions. Data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, CDSR, ASSIA, PsycINFO and Scopus databases (Jan 1997-Dec 2017). Results: Twenty-four studies were included. Results suggest that carers have support needs in a range of domains including physical, social, psychological and spiritual. Many of these needs are unmet. Particular areas of concern relate to prolonged social isolation, accessing services, emotional support and information needs. Findings also suggest amendment of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool may be required relating to difficulties within relationship management. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that carers of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would benefit from identification and response to their support needs by healthcare professionals but to enable this, the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool requires an additional question. Future planned work will explore this with carers of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - Housing safety and health problems threaten owners' and occupiers' safety and health. Nevertheless, there is no systematic review on this topic to the best of our knowledge. This study compared the academic and public opinions on housing safety and health and reviewed 982 research articles and 3,173 author works on housing safety and health published in the Web of Science Core Collection. PRISMA was used to filter the data, and natural language processing (NLP) was used to analyze emotions of the abstracts. Only 16 housing safety and health articles existed worldwide before 1998 but increased afterward. U.S. scholars published most research articles (30.76%). All top 10 most productive countries were developed countries, except China, which ranked second (16.01%). Only 25.9% of institutions have inter-institutional cooperation, and collaborators from the same institution produce most work. This study found that most abstracts were positive (n = 521), but abstracts with negative emotions attracted more citations. Despite many industries moving toward AI, housing safety and health research are exceptions as per articles published and Tweets. On the other hand, this study reviewed 8,257 Tweets to compare the focus of the public to academia. There were substantially more housing/residential safety (n = 8198) Tweets than housing health Tweets (n = 59), which is the opposite of academic research. Most Tweets about housing/residential safety were from the United Kingdom or Canada, while housing health hazards were from India. The main concern about housing safety per Twitter includes finance, people, and threats to housing safety. By contrast, people mainly concerned about costs of housing health issues, COVID, and air quality. In addition, most housing safety Tweets were neutral but positive dominated residential safety and health Tweets.

AB  - Aquatic biological communities have directly undergone human-induced changes. Altered hydrological and morphological processes in running waters have caused the degradation of main habitats for biotas and have disturbed ecosystem functionality. The latest advances in river restoration concerned the rise in far-reaching hydromorphological restoration actions that have been implemented below dams to reverse well-known negative impacts of anthropogenic pressures. Some authors emphasized the enhancement of sediment supply and habitat diversity using gravel augmentation or bank erosion to restore morphodynamics, and thus improve bio-diversity. We explored the Web of Science database for empirical research papers that specifically addressed such hydromorphological river restoration actions. Articles were examined using a text-content analysis tool to determine the major concepts or ideas they deal with. It has also been proved as useful in defining interrelationships and degree of interdisciplinary. Results showed that a low number of published scientific articles exist about such projects, mainly condensed in the North hemisphere. Divergent ecological issues were highlighted by the word co-occurrence networks: (i) gravel augmentation was used to improve spawning habitats for fish of economic interest whereas (ii) erodible corridor was designed to safeguard natural riparian systems, approaching morphological goals of channel widening. Overall, ecological responses were consistent with those expected, leading however rather to functional shifts than richness increase. Gravel augmentation or bank erosion were not usually combined with in-channel structure management. However, this might be an option to consider since the biological communities seem to be sensitive during first restorations with such combination. This review demonstrates the value of word co-occurrence networks in exploring a high number of previous publications, keys for formulating guidance to manage gravel augmentation or bank erosion along ecological purposes.

AB  - In many countries, more resources are required for the conservation of threatened species than are made available. Australia, the home to many unique mammalian species, has been identified as one of the top seven countries worldwide with the highest biodiversity loss and lowest amount of funding dedicated to conservation. Conservation action is generally determined by what we perceive to be the most significant conservation problems; therefore, identifying potential biases in research effort is crucial for prioritising research actions for effective conservation outcomes. We reviewed the published literature on the koala Phascolarctos cinereus, a vulnerable arboreal marsupial. Our aim was to assess and quantify research efforts (number of publications) and research coverage (diversity of subject areas) of koala-related research. We then focused on the research effort of threats to identify primary threats and fields requiring further research. Using a combination of key words, journal name, study title, and methods, we reviewed and categorised 714 publications to identify the focus of research efforts. We investigated subject area, geographic and temporal publication patterns, and the extent to which primary threats have been addressed. We found a trend of increasing number of publications with a diversification of threat-based studies, and identified both geographic and subject bias in research effort. Geographic bias in the volume of research indicates that the level of koala research between regions may be a response to the species' distribution, status and impact of threats. Research areas 'anatomy and physiology' and 'threats' received comparatively more research attention than other areas. We found a research bias between threats, with 'disease' representing a high percentage of all threat-based publications. Areas that have been identified but are receiving little research attention include habitat selection and use, along with the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation.

AB  - Previous research suggests an association between hospital volume and outcomes in high-risk surgical pathologies. The association between hospital volume and outcomes in patients with isolated descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (DTAAs) and type-B thoracic aortic dissections (TBADs) is conflicting. We aimed to investigate this in a literature review and meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies reporting mortality and morbidity following repair (elective or emergency) of DTAA and/or TBAD using the Medline and Embase Databases (2000-2015). Hospital volume was assessed based on the number of patients treated per institution: low volume (1-5 cases per year), medium volume (6-10) and high volume (> 10). The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality during inpatient stay and at 30 days. Eighty-four series of non-dissecting DTAA or TBAD were included in data synthesis (4219 patients; mean age: 62 years; males: 73.5%). For all patients (emergency and elective) undergoing DTAA repair, in-hospital mortality was 8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6-8%]. Results were not superior in high-volume centres (8 vs 6 vs 11% for high-, medium- and low-volume, respectively). Sub-analyses for emergency and elective repairs showed no significant differences. For TBAD repairs, in the combined population (emergency and elective), results reached borderline significance (P = 0.0475), favouring high- volume centres ( 6 vs 11 vs 14%), but this association disappeared when emergency and elective repairs were analysed separately. Nine series reported outcomes at 1 year and 5 series followed DTAA and 18 TBAD treatment. No meaningful long-term comparisons were possible due to the lack of data. No significant associations were detected between hospital volume and subsequent mortality following DTAA or TBAD treatment. Data were heterogeneous and long-term results were scarcely reported. A well-designed longitudinal study of sufficient size is required to inform future strategies in this area.

AB  - CONTEXT: Organic agriculture is widely acknowledged as a strategy to reduce the environmental impacts of food production while helping achieving global climate and biodiversity targets. Yet, recent global studies and metaanalyses have highlighted the strong nitrogen (N) limitation of many organic cropping systems. Sustaining crop yields thanks to biological N fixation (BNF) in organic cropping systems is key. However, we lack a systematic estimate of BNF operated by legume crops under organic management, and how it varies according to crop species and cropping practices.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide systematic estimate of the BNF operated by legume crops for organically managed leguminous crops according to different cropping practices.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature by collecting information on the N-2 fixation under organic farming - mainly as N-2 fixation absolute value (Ndfa, in kgN. ha(-1) yr(-1)) and as the percentage of aboveground biomass N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa).
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We show that significant differences exist in the BNF among crop types and cropping practices. Best performances were found for both fodder crop species compared to pulses and for crop species characterized by long growing periods. We show a strong positive relationship between Ndfa and aboveground biomass production. We also found a strong variability in the performances of single crop species and cropping practices within different geographical sites.
   SIGNIFICANCE: The BNF estimates provided here are key for designing more agroecological organic cropping systems that better rely on the BNF service provided by legume crops. They also represent an important base for exploring strategies that enhance N sourcing in organic cropping systems.

AB  - The number of science publications is growing exponentially, thus increasing the need for understanding the knowledge base of various research streams and their emerging branches. From a social science perspective, the literature on the mining sector the industrial sector that extracts ores and minerals from the ground has also witnessed steady growth. However, this literature is rather fragmented in regards to the thematic topics and the geographical focus. To respond to this, this paper offers a systematic literature review of the social science research on the mining sector. The publication database of this review includes a set of 483 systemically selected papers from 976 authors, covering empirical research conducted in 73 countries from 5 continents: Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and America. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we provide an analysis of the geography of the research in terms of both authorship and empirical focus. In terms of the geographical coverage of the empirical cases, Australia appears as the most studied country in the field, followed by countries in other regions such as Asia (China, India, Russia and Turkey), Africa (Ghana, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), North America (the USA and Canada), Latin America (Brazil and Chile) and Europe (Poland, Spain and Sweden). However, this dispersion is not reflected in the geographical coverage of the affiliations of the authors. Secondly, we identify the most popular social science research topics on the mining sector. Our results show that the social science research on the mining sector shifted from the traditional research streams (e.g., industrialisation and growth, colonialization, technological and economic development, and the resource curse) to the new streams of research on social, environmental and economical sustainability (e.g., the social license to operate, corporate social responsibility, criticality of the rare earth elements, material flow analysis and environmental impacts). Overall, our study serves as an entry point for researches who are interested in social science research on the mining sector.

AB  - For cities seeking to promote active transport, overcoming the institutional practices of car-centric planning and investment is critical to redistributing funds toward dedicated walking and cycling infrastructure. Slowly, urban policy and research are expanding traditional mobility-centric economic evaluations beyond major road and rail projects. This review paper of the academic literature employs a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) methodology and contributes an up-to-date examination of academic economic evaluations undertaken on large-scale active transport infrastructure implementations (i.e. capital costs greater than USD$3 million as of 2022). Seventeen (17) peer-reviewed academic papers were included in the final analysis. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), followed by cost-effective analysis (CEA) and health impact assessment (HIA), were the most common pre-implementation (ex ante) and post-implementation (ex post) assessment methods. Between implementation-types, contexts, and methodologies, the parameters factored in econometric evaluations present a large degree of variance. Despite this, all studies demonstrated the positive return on investment in large-scale active transport infrastructure, where all CBAs produced benefit-cost ratios greater than the breakeven threshold (i.e. >1). Results show health parameters contribute the greatest benefit to positive evaluations, accounting for 77% of total benefits (and 67% in the CBA papers). However, evaluations inconsistently factor or omit long-term, intergenerational, and non-mobility benefits that highlight a partiality in their approach and can be co-opted to support predetermined outcomes. Further research must seek to establish if more expansive, sustainability-orientated methods are needed, or whether to adopt policy positions acknowledging the positive returns walking and cycling infrastructure deliver.

AB  - The development of hydropower and other infrastructure that disrupts river connectivity poses a serious threat to highly endemic and genetically distinct freshwater fish species in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere. Such locations have been neglected in previous reviews on fish passage. Fishways have long been constructed to mitigate the impacts of riverine barriers on fish, yet they have often failed for all but the largest, strongest swimming taxa. This is a particular problem in the temperate south, which is home to native species that are non-recreational and generally small-bodied with weak swimming abilities (e.g. Galaxiidae) relative to typical target species for fishway design (e.g. Salmonidae). Using the Eco Evidence method for rapid evidence synthesis, we undertook an assessment of evidence for effective fishway design focusing on species representative of the temperate south, including eel and lamprey. Systematic literature searches resulted in 630 publications. Through a rigorous screening process these were reduced to 46 publications containing 76 evidence items across 19 hypotheses relating to design criteria for upstream and downstream passage. We found an overwhelming lack of evidence for effective fishway design in the temperate south. Particular deficiencies were found with regard to the design of effective facilities for downstream passage. The attraction and entrance of upstream migrating fish into fishways is also relatively under-researched. Given the urgent need for effective fishways in the temperate south, these results justify an approach to fishway design based on a combination of empirical data and expert knowledge. In the meantime, significant resources should be assigned to improve the evidence base through high quality research. The particular deficiencies identified here could guide that research agenda.

AB  - Emerging autonomous driving technologies are claimed to create new opportunities for realizing smart and sustainable urban mobility initiatives. In this perspective, some studies identified shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as being a crucial element of on-demand mobility services. There is, however, limited evidence from practice on what roles SAVs play in delivering smart urban mobility. In other words, SAV in the context of smart urban mobility is an understudied area of research with limited review studies. To bridge this gap in the literature, this study aims to investigate and map out the service attributes and impacts of SAVs on urban mobility, infrastructure and land use, travel behavior, and the environment. As the methodological approach, the paper adopts the systematic literature review technique. The study findings reveal that: (a) Providing dynamic ridesharing services could result in significant reduction of SAV fleet size, congestion, travel cost, parking demand, vehicle ownership, and emissions; (b) Positive environmental outcomes could be enhanced with full electrification of SAV fleet through renewable energy charging; (c) Integration of SAV, as a smart urban mobility system with dynamic ridesharing services, could promote sustainability and social and transportation equity, and their adoption. In the light of the findings, this study advocates the consolidation of urban/transport policy to achieve desired urban mobility outcomes.

AB  - Objective In the United States, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is significantly less diagnosed in Spanish-speaking populations compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Structural barriers such as transportation, insurance, and time have been documented within this population. However, many families also report language as a barrier. The present systematic literature review aims to evaluate research findings on the influence of Spanish language and culture on the ASD screening process.Method Five databases were searched using key words relating to the aim of the paper to identify potential articles to review. Inclusion criteria included: (1) sample of participants diagnosed with ASD/being evaluated for ASD, (2) Latinx populations that included Spanish-speaking participants, (3) a reference to language included as a research aim or study outcome, and (5) a focus on the screening process or measures for ASD. A total of 132 articles were initially identified.Results After reviewing for inclusion criteria, 22 articles were included. In total, six countries were represented across all included papers. Major themes emerged regarding barriers to care, cultural awareness, translation barriers, intervention, knowledge/awareness, and screener evaluation.Discussion Findings indicate that language and sociocultural differences can affect knowledge development, communication within healthcare settings, and result in a limited number of translated resources available for the heterogeneous population of Spanish-speakers.

AB  - Fine-scale tracking technology has advanced our understanding of aquatic animal behaviour by deriving near-continuous movements of animals ranging in size from small invertebrates to large predatory fish. Commercial fine-scale positioning systems, such as the VEMCO Positioning System, can pinpoint an animal's location within metres of its true position. While methodological applications of commonly used presence-absence acoustic telemetry have identified factors that can limit array performance, the factors that influence position yield and accuracy and introduce error in fine-scale positioning systems have yet to be synthesised. Evidenced through a systematic review of the literature, we highlight key considerations and potential pitfalls faced when designing and conducting a fine-scale tracking study. Key factors impacting data acquisition are grouped under 4 key categories linked to the study system, species studied, and logistical and technological constraints. Thereafter, in line with these categories, we provide a framework that can be used prior to, during, and post-study to identify sources of error and data loss to optimize system design and acquired results. We provide details on user assessment tools that include a pre-study trial period using fixed tags to assess array geometry and data yield, an in situ checkpoint data download, and a post-study assessment of fixed transmitter performance. We highlight the utility of this framework and integrated assessment tools by presenting a real-world case study that ultimately was compromised. We anticipate that this framework can be used to standardize reporting of essential steps and checks that will generate comparable data for future synthesis, which will further advance fine-scale tracking approaches.

AB  - The lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is applied in many different in vivo biomonitoring studies of human exposure to genotoxic chemicals. Among extensively chemicals investigated, we identified petroleum and its derivatives, in particular benzene and the most common mixture of benzene, toluene, and xylene. Although conflicting results have been reported on the effects of benzene exposure, the number of positive findings in independent studies suggests that occupational exposure to benzene causes DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. To assess current evidence on this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of benzene exposure on genetic damage, quantified using the CBMN assay on individuals occupationally exposed to petroleum and its derivatives. Statistical analyses were conducted using the rmeta package from the free Software Environment for Statistical Computing R. Combined study results indicated that benzene exposure is associated with an increased level of genetic damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as reflected by an increased MN frequency. The summary mean difference in MN frequency between exposed and unexposed individuals was 1.64 (95% CI: 0.80-2.47). Overall, this finding points to MN frequency as a sensitive biomarker which could be used to evaluate genetic damage induced by occupational industrial or environmental - exposure to benzene. This review also identified some important knowledge gaps as well as the need of large, well-designed studies. In particular, it is fundamental to accurately characterize the investigated population, including dietary habits and genetic variability which could modulate MN frequency in both exposed individuals and unexposed controls. In conclusion, according to present findings the use of the CBMN assay in biomonitoring studies could provide objective evidence to guide prioritization of preventive interventions in subjects occupationally exposed to petroleum derivatives, and in particular benzene.

AB  - The contradiction between rapid soil degradation and increased food demand is becoming increasingly prominent. Reasonable recycling of agricultural waste can affect soil productivity and environmental health, thus playing a crucial role in the sustainability of agricultural production. Through a meta-analysis of 160 studies in the region of upland double cropping in China, we evaluate crop yield and soil quality responses to organic amendments. Results indicated that soil quality index (17.6%-26.3%) and crop yield (6.0%-9.0%) were significantly increased by adding organic amendments to chemical fertilizer. Combination of organic materials with total chemical fertilizer (OTC) and with part chemical fertilizer (ORC) significantly increased the yield by 8.3% and 8.7% and soil quality by 19.5% and 18.4%, respectively. However, application of organic materials alone (O) decreased yields (by -0.6%), but significantly increased soil quality (by 49.1%). On average, organic amendments resulted in higher crop yield and soil quality index, despite variability introduced by tillage regimes and conditions of soil and climate. Relatively larger positive effect in crop yield and soil quality occurred with mean annual precipitation >1000 and <600 mm, respectively. Additional analyses found that biochar, organic fertilizer or ORC can promote sustainable agricultural development via improving crop yields, soil quality, and reducing nitrogen losses. Our results provide the first systematic review of effect of the organic amendments on the balance between soil quality and crop yield. The findings suggest that impacts of adding organic amendments to chemical fertilizer may be used as the foundation for policies. However, the combined use of organic amendments and other farmland management practices still present an area that needs further research in order to promote sustainable development of agriculture.

AB  - Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB  - Water shortage is a concern in arid and semi-arid regions across the globe due to their lack of precipitation and unpredictable rainfall patterns. In the past few decades, many frameworks, each with their own criteria, have been used to identify and rank sites for rainwater harvesting (RWH), a process which is critical for the improvement and maintenance of water resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This study reviews the present state of the art in rainwater harvesting site selection for such regions and identifies areas for additional research. The results of a systematic review performed based on two major databases of engineering research, Scopus and Engineering Village, are presented. Sixty-eight relevant studies were found and critically analysed to identify patterns and unique features in the frameworks used. The results of this study show that 41% of the frameworks consider both biophysical and socioeconomic criteria, whereas the remaining 59% of the frameworks depend on biophysical criteria alone. The importance of each criterion is encapsulated through a suitability score, with 21% of the frameworks using a binary (0 or 1) indicator of whether the site matches a criterion or not and the other frameworks using graded scales of differing granularities, with 52% using a low-resolution scale of 1 to 3, 4, or 5, 7% using a medium-resolution scale of 1 to 10, and a further 7% using a high-resolution scale of 1 to 100. The remaining 13% of the frameworks did not specify the scale used. Importantly, this paper concludes that all existing frameworks for selecting RWH sites are solely based on biophysical and/or socioeconomic criteria; ecological impacts, the consideration of which is vital for building RWH systems sustainably, are currently ignored.

AB  - Business research has repeatedly been criticized for its lack of engagement with pressing issues such as climate change, despite a surge of publications on corporate sustainability topics in recent years. We are therefore interested in identifying the knowledge development and knowledge gaps in business scholarship on the relationship between firms, environment and society. This paper provides a systematic review of the corporate sustainability field in form of a bibliometric analysis based on citation data acquired from the Social Sciences Citation Index. The final dataset contained 3117 records published between 1953 and 2011. Our analysis shows that, over the last 50 years, the field of corporate sustainability has emerged from a few primary nodes of research and developed into four distinct conceptual genealogies: corporate social performance theory, stakeholder theory, a corporate social performance versus economic performance debate, and a greening of management debate. The results of our analysis suggest four key findings. First, the four genealogies only comprise a relatively narrowly focused research scope. Second, there is very little integration and citation of work in other disciplinary areas such as ecology or environmental science. Third, the existing literature has a strong focus on empirically examining the relationship between a firm's environmental and/or social performance and its financial performance. Finally, there is little consideration of managerial implications and consequences of climate change in the corporate sustainability literature to date. We suggest that while this may be a reflection of an insular field, it may also be a role played by the management literature turning away from problem based issues in favor of empirical results, theory building, and the identification of variables that influence firm profitability and can be subjected to direct managerial control. We conclude by outlining pathways for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Food insecurity and the weak position of smallholders in food value chains are key challenges in many lowand middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to increase food security and make agricultural value chains more inclusive, donors, governments and researchers increasingly stimulate partnerships between multiple actors, in which knowledge exchange, joint learning and knowledge co-creation play a central role in reducing the time lag between research findings and their translation into practical outcomes. Yet, despite the growing body of literature on multi-actor and cross-sector learning in these partnerships, an overview of existing literature and a strong evidence base of results of knowledge co-creation in these platforms is missing. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper documents existing evidence of knowledge co-creation processes in multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings reveal, first, many examples of positive results, including increased yields and income for farmers; policy, regime and institutional changes; and changes in environmental sustainability. Second, there are several limitations to what MSPs can achieve, including limited attention for scaling up and a lack of sustainability due to dependency on donor funding. Third, there are limitations related to the evidence base: there is a tendency to report less on failures and available findings on the effectiveness of MSPs are mixed. Considering the evidence base, we conclude that there is a need to systematically document, report and assess MSPs and not take their effectiveness for granted. A systematic literature review thereby has an important added value because the critical assessment of methodological rigour increases the credibility of results documented in the included studies.

AB  - A number of studies address the spatial planning, architectural design, and management of public open spaces (POSs) to curb the overuse of spaces to create high-quality spaces. Little attention has been paid to the problem of underutilization of POSs. Therefore, this paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the literature on the factors that influence the vitality of POSs, proposing Bronfenbrenner's social-ecological model (SEM) as a conceptual framework. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature search using the PRISMA method to screen and select articles from three major databases (Science Web, Elsevier, and Scopus). Thirty-four journal articles from 2000 to 2022 were selected for the final review. This study systematically identifies and classifies a set of variables related to the vitality of POSs and develops an SEM-based framework of factors that influence the vitality of POSs. The framework examines the influence of individual user characteristics, the social environment, the physical environment, and the political environment on the vitality of POSs. Finally, strategies to improve the vitality of POSs are proposed: (1) POSs' optimization and promotion strategies should be developed gradually, starting from the most basic needs, stage by stage; (2) To improve the vitality of POSs, we should consider both the general public and special groups; (3) Through the synergistic effect between social, material, and policy environments, the comprehensive improvement of POSs' vitality is achieved. This study provides the latest insights into the vitality of POSs and makes a theoretical contribution by conceptualizing the SEM framework and summarizing the influencing factors at different levels. The study of these factors should also have practical implications, as the results will ultimately provide improvement strategies to help policy-makers and local communities to effectively and sustainably improve the vitality of POSs.

AB  - Lead is one of the 10 most toxic chemicals of greatest concern for its effects on public health. Predominantly, in undeveloped countries, high blood lead levels (BLLs) persist in the population. To develop intervention strategies that may reduce lead exposure in populations, it is a priority to know the sources of lead pollution. The objective of this critical review and meta-analysis is to assess whether there is an association between different sources of lead exposure and the mean difference in blood lead levels in people exposed. To identify the major lead source exposure, a statistical analysis was performed on selection studies. This investigation reveals the limited infor-mation available on the sources of lead in Mexico and other lead producer countries, such as Croatia, Ecuador, Brazil, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Turkey, and China. Meta-analysis could be performed only in battery, smelting mining, and glazed ceramic workers. Battery manufacturing workers have the highest mean difference level of lead in their blood worldwide. Mexico has the second highest mean difference BLL in battery workers in the world. An interesting difference between the mean difference in BLL in mining workers from uncontrolled industry (-39.38) and controlled industry (-5.68) was found. This difference highlighted the success of applying strict control of lead sources and community education to reduce BLL and its potential harmful effects on human health and the environment. Children living near mining sites have the highest mean difference BLL (-11.1). This analysis may aid in assessing the source of lead exposure associated with a range of BLLs in people. Furthermore, this review highlights several social and cultural patterns associated with lead exposure and lead levels in control populations. These results could help to develop international lead regulations and appropriate public health guidelines to protect people around the world.

AB  - Due to the interconnectedness of aquatic ecosystems through the highly effective marine and atmospheric transport routes, all aquatic ecosystems are potentially vulnerable to pollution. Whilst links between pollution and increased mortality of wild animals have now been firmly established, the next steps should be to focus on specific physiological pathways and pathologies that link pollution to wildlife health deterioration. One of the pollution-induced pathologies that should be at the centre of attention in ecological and evolutionary research is cancer, as anthropogenic contamination has resulted in a rapid increase of oncogenic substances in natural habitats. Whilst wildlife cancer research is an emerging research topic, systematic reviews of the many case studies published over the recent decades are scarce. This research direction would (1) provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms connecting anthropogenic pollution to oncogenic processes in non model organisms (reducing the current bias towards human and lab-animal studies in cancer research), and (2) allow us to better predict the vulnerability of different wild populations to oncogenic contamination. This article combines the information available within the scientific literature about cancer occurrences in aquatic and semi aquatic species. For the first aim, we use available knowledge from aquatic species to suggest physiological mechanisms that link pollution and cancer, including main metabolic detoxification pathways, oxidative damage effects, infections, and changes to the microbiome. For the second aim, we determine which types of aquatic animals are more vulnerable to pollution-induced cancer, which types of pollution are mainly associated with cancer in aquatic ecosystems, and which types of cancer pollution causes. We also discuss the role of migration in exposing aquatic and semi-aquatic animals to different oncogenic pollutants. Finally, we suggest novel research avenues, including experimental approaches, analysis of the effects of pollutant cocktails and long-term chronic exposure to lower levels of pollutants, and the use of already published databases of gene expression levels in animals from differently polluted habitats.

AB  - BackgroundMental health problems among young people are a major global public health challenge. Psychological interventions may improve mental health, yet most are developed in western cultures, and it is unclear whether they are applicable to other geographical settings and can be delivered successfully to diverse populations. We identified empirical studies focusing upon cross-culturally adapted psychological interventions and examined the cultural adaptation process used and the effectiveness of the interventions in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety disorders among young people (defined here as children and adolescents aged between 8-18 years).MethodWe conducted a scoping review aligning to the guidelines reported in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Statement. Stakeholder engagement enabled us to discuss the findings of the review and obtain feedback.ResultsWe identified 17 studies of cross-culturally adapted psychological interventions that considered the appropriate language, metaphors, culturally appropriate terms, and cultural values of young people. Most studies (n = 11) adopted a randomised control trial (RCT) methodology. Six studies used the ecological validity and cultural sensitivity framework. Planned adaptation, cultural adaptation of content, and surface and deep structure level adaptations were used in other studies. Apart from one pilot study, all studies reported that culturally adapted interventions resulted in improvements in depression and/or anxiety symptoms in young people. The results suggest the potential effectiveness of cross-culturally adapted interventions within this context. Our stakeholder consultations demonstrated that engaging different community-level stakeholders in the adaptation process was highly recommended.ConclusionsWhilst most included studies indicated improvements in depression and/or anxiety symptoms in young people following a cross-culturally adapted intervention, more work is needed in this area. In particular, focus should be placed upon identifying the dimensions of interventions that should be culturally adapted to make them acceptable, engaging and effective.

AB  - The number of invasions by non-native species and their negative impacts is increasing, especially in developing megadiverse countries. The current catalogue of hypotheses, concepts and management policies related to invasions was typically created and evaluated in temperate and economically rich regions. So what we know about invasion biology may not provide a general pattern applicable to developing megadiverse regions. All recent reviews have indicated a demand for more studies in tropical and megadiverse regions. Additionally, potential differences in the quality and availability of data may preclude any comparative analyses between developing and developed nations and hinder global strategies to combat invasions. Therefore, it is important to synthesize the existing knowledge on the subject in order to aid conservation activities in such regions. We conducted a systematic review of non-native species and invasions in Brazil and found geographical bias towards the most populated regions and biomes. Plants and fish were the most studied groups and were, for the most part, intentionally introduced, usually to meet some economic interest. We also noted the dominance of studies concerning terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Most studies did not address species interactions and, in the few cases where they did, the most frequently studied were between non-native and native species. There was a paucity of research beyond the level of species records and descriptive patterns. We highlight major vectors of introduction, the number of non-native species (proxy to colonization pressure) and papers (proxy to propagule pressure) related to each vector and the need for designed surveys and experiments focusing on specific invasion hypotheses and/or species interactions. We indicate major gaps and biases nationally that should be the focus for future studies, and that can serve as examples for other megadiverse countries.

AB  - Efforts to increase agricultural productivity, adapt to climate change, and reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture are reflected in a growing interest in climate-smart agriculture (CSA). Specific indicators of productivity, adaptation and mitigation are commonly used in support of claims about the climate smartness of practices. However, it is rare that these three objectives can be optimized simultaneously by any one strategy. In evaluating the relative climate smartness of different agricultural practices, plans and policies, there is a need for metrics that can simultaneously represent all three objectives and therefore be used in comparing strategies that have different benefits and trade-offs across this triad of objectives. In this context, a method for developing a Climate Smartness Index (CSI) is presented. The process of developing the index follows four steps: (1) defining system specific climate smartness; (2) selecting relevant indicators; (3) normalizing against reference values from a systematic literature review; and (4) aggregating and weighting. The CSI presented here has been developed for application in a systematic review of rice irrigation strategies and it combines normalized water productivity (WP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) The CSI was developed for application to data from published field experiments that assessed the impact of water management practices in irrigated rice, focusing on practices heralded as climate-smart strategies, such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). The analysis shows that the CSI can provide a consistent judgment of the treatments based on the evidence of water efficiency and reduced GHGI reported in such studies. Using ameasurable and replicable index supports the aim of generating a reliable quantification of the climate smartness of agricultural practices. The same four step process can be used to build metrics for a broad range of CSA practice, policy and planning.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to synthesize evidence of management control systems (MCS) that are employed by organizations to enforce sustainable development (SD). We aim at suggesting a roadmap for coherent research.
   For this, we conduct a 'systematic' review based on an initial sample of 12,139 sources between 1988 and 2013. We then discuss 83 empirical studies in natural and social sciences. The MCS framework of Malmi and Brown (2008) ensures a comprehensive understanding of SD enforcement in practice.
   We identify diverse types of controls that organizations use to enforce SD. Our findings problematize examples where the MCS is unable to appropriately address all relevant aspects of SD. We find that organizations prefer to manage and control smaller aspects of SD, such as environmental responsibility. Social responsibility is addressed less frequently, and only few organizations implement a sustainable MCS (SMCS) that addresses all aspects of SD. Classic 'cybernetic' controls are the preferred choice in MCS, but organizations have advanced beyond them during the past decade.
   Our main contribution is a structured map of contemporary research that points to areas where our understanding of SMCSs is still scarce, such as their interplay with contextual factors and the resulting, long-term performance effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Intensified food production, i.e. agricultural intensification and industrialized livestock operations may have adverse effects on human health and promote disease emergence via numerous mechanisms resulting in either direct impacts on humans or indirect impacts related to animal and environmental health. For example, while biodiversity is intentionally decreased in intensive food production systems, the consequential decrease in resilience in these systems may in turn bear increased health risks. However, quantifying these risks remains challenging, even if individual intensification measures are examined separately. Yet, this is an urgent task, especially in rapidly developing areas of the world with few regulations on intensification measures, such as in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
   Methods: We systematically searched the databases PubMed and Scopus for recent studies conducted on the association between agricultural (irrigation, fertilization, pesticide application) and livestock (feed additives, animal crowding) intensification measures and human health risks in the GMS. The search terms used were iteratively modified to maximize the number of retrieved studies with relevant quantitative data.
   Results: We found that alarmingly little research has been done in this regard, considering the level of environmental contamination with pesticides, livestock infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens and disease vector proliferation in irrigated agroecosystems reported in the retrieved studies. In addition, each of the studies identified focused on specific aspects of intensified food production and there have been no efforts to consolidate the health risks from the simultaneous exposures to the range of hazardous chemicals utilized.
   Conclusions: While some of the studies identified already reported environmental contamination bearing considerable health risks for local people, at the current state of research the actual consolidated risk from regional intensification measures cannot be estimated. Efforts in this area of research need to be rapidly and considerably scaled up, keeping pace with the current level of regional intensification and the speed of pesticide and drug distribution to facilitate the development of agriculture related policies for regional health promotion.

AB  - As a result of recent, substantial capacity building, a new landscape for cancer drug trials is emerging in China. However, data on the characteristics of cancer drug trials, and how they have changed over time, are scarce. Based on clinical trials published on the China Food and Drug Administration Registration and Information Disclosure Platform for Drug Clinical Studies, we aimed to systematically review changes over time in clinical trials of cancer drugs in mainland China from 2009 to 2018, to provide insight on the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical industry and identify unmet clinical needs of stakeholders. A total of 1493 trials of 751 newly tested cancer drugs were initiated. Increases over time were observed for the annual number of initiated trials, newly tested drugs, and newly added leading clinical trial units, with a sharp increase after 2016. Of the 1385 trials in which cancer types were identified, solid tumours (325 [23%] trials), non-small-cell lung cancer (232 [17%]), and lymphoma (126 [9%]) were the most common. A markedly uneven distribution was also observed in the geography of leading units with the largest number of leading units located in east China (50 [41%]) and the smallest number located in southwest China (4 [3%]). The growth trends we observed illustrate the progress in and increasing capability of cancer drug research and development achieved in mainland China over the decade from 2009. The low number of clinical trials on tumours with epidemiological characteristics unique to the Chinese population and the unbalanced geographical distribution of leading clinical trial units will provide potential targets for policy makers and other stakeholders. Further research efforts should address cancers uniquely relevant to Chinese populations, globally rare cancers, and the balance between equitable drug access, efficiency, and sustainability of cancer drug research and development in mainland China.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate glaucoma prevalence and disease burden across Asian subregions from 2013 to 2040.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 population-based studies of 1318 primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) cases in 66 800 individuals and 691 primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) cases in 72 767 individuals in Asia. Regions in Asia were defined based on United Nations' (UN) classification of macro-geographic regions. PubMed, Medline and Web of Science databases were searched for population-based glaucoma prevalence studies using standardised criteria published to 31 December 2013. Pooled glaucoma prevalence for individuals aged 40-80 years was calculated using hierarchical Bayesian approaches. Prevalence differences by geographic subregion, subtype and habitation were examined with random effects meta-regression models. Estimates of individuals with glaucoma from 2013 to 2040 were based on the UN World Population Prospects.
   Results In 2013, pooled overall glaucoma prevalence was 3.54% (95% credible interval (CrI) 1.83 to 6.28). POAG (2.34%, 95% CrI 0.96 to 4.55) predominated over PACG (0.73%, 95% CrI 0.18 to 1.96). With age and gender adjustment, PACG prevalence was higher in East than South East Asia (OR 5.55, 95% CrI 1.52 to 14.73), and POAG prevalence was higher in urban than rural populations (OR 2.11, 95% CrI 1.57 to 2.38). From 2013 to 2040, South Central Asia will record the steepest increase in number of glaucoma individuals from 17.06 million to 32.90 million compared with other Asian subregions. In 2040, South-Central Asia is also projected to overtake East Asia for highest overall glaucoma and POAG burden, while PACG burden remains highest in East Asia.
   Conclusions Across the Asian subregions, there was greater glaucoma burden in South-Central and East Asia. Sustainable public health strategies to combat glaucoma in Asia are needed.

AB  - Soil degradation and water scarcity are key constraints underlying low crop productivity in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, adoption of improved technologies and effective management practices for optimizing soil water conservation and improving soil fertility is crucial for sustainable food production in dryland areas. A meta-analysis using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guideline was performed to synthesize studies investigating the impact of plastic film and wheat straw mulching on maize water use efficiency (WUE), evapotranspiration, and grain yield in northern China. Articles published from 2001 to 2021 were examined to investigate the influence of mulching and ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting systems on maize grain yield. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the plastic mulched ridge with straw mulch furrow increased maize grain yield and water use efficiency in low rainfall areas. Compared to traditional flat planting (TFP) with no mulching, plastic film mulch with straw mulched furrow (PMR+ SMF) treatment significantly (p = 0.0008) increased WUE of maize by 69.51% in areas where air temperature was <10 degrees C but had no significant effect on evapotranspiration. Maize grain yield in Shaanxi and Gansu areas increased significantly (by 52.52%, p <0 .00001) with the integration of PMR+ SMF system compared to the TFP with the no mulching. However, the plastic film mulch and wheat straw mulch acting solely or in combination did not significantly affect maize evapotranspiration under the different climate and soil types investigated. The integration of RFRHs with plastic film with wheat straw mulching can improve crop productivity and WUE. Findings from the meta-analysis lay a platform for the adoption of climate-smart integrated soil water management practice in semiarid areas to strengthen climate-resilient crop production.

AB  - Regional ecosystem monitoring is a central form of knowledge sharing and collaboration amongst scientists and decision makers on environmental health, land use change, and science-policy development. Despite the proliferation of such research networks on long-term monitoring on many continents, little has been achieved in Africa. This study aims to assess and examine the spatiotemporal trend and categorical patterns in ecosystem monitoring-related research in Africa for the benefits of conserving biodiversity and sustaining natural resource sectors for well-being and livelihood security, environmental planning, and ecological stewardship. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric tools. Based on a set of search terms and peer-reviewed publications retrieved from various ecosystem monitoring networks and journal databases, further analysis was conducted using social network approaches, mapping tools, and content analysis. About 1442 scientific publications on ecosystem monitoring and related research were documented from 1987 to 2014 mostly published in English. The number of publication increased progressively since 1992 after the Convention on Biodiversity was signed and this trend peaked till 2008. South African Journal of Science was the most leading journal and Nature the most cited. Internationally coauthored and collaborative articles represented majority of the findings with the United Kingdom at the central position in the research network due to colonial relationships. Regional collaboration amongst countries is limited owing to language barriers and other institutional constraints such as funding and short-term projects. These findings have implication for prioritizing national and regional policies toward biodiversity science and its contribution to human well-being, food security, and global change responses.

AB  - The paper offers psychological explanations for linguistic and educational issues that arise as a result of the accelerated loss of cultural and linguistic diversity in heterogeneous settings in Central-Eastern Europe, attributable mainly to the decline in the number of indigenous ethnic minorities. The aim is to analyze the psychological mechanisms of language and culture shift using knowledge from the psychology of learning (operant and classical conditioning) and motivation, seeking answers to the following research questions: 1) What are the possible psychological explanations of the decrease of minority language use, and linguistic and cultural shift?, and 2) What are the guiding principles that should be taken into consideration when choosing the medium of education/instruction for indigenous ethnolinguistic children in Central-Eastern Europe to mitigate this decrease? A systematic review conducted on sources from the field of the psychology of multilingualims running the SCOPUs database, and the applied behaviour analysis (ABA) on selected sources has shown that such a systematic analysis is missing. The context of the analysis is the debate between representatives of pluralistic conceptions and their opponents over language use and educational practice that support sustainable development in heterogeneous regions. Analysing their views it turned out that the linguistic and cultural shift can be, at least partly, explained with the mechanisms of positive reinforcement, punishment, avoiding, and with the concepts of learned helplessness and culture shock. It is concluded that strong models of multilingual education, relying on pluralists` view, offer ways to slow down the decrease of diversity. The Minority SafePack Initiative that calls for protection of European language minorities seems justifiable, but further research is needed on interactions between decline of diversity and developmental processes in children.

AB  - Groundwater supplies are progressively being degraded by anthropogenic pollution, making it challenging to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of access to safe and clean drinking water (SDG 6.1 and 6.3) and reduction of illness and death from hazardous pollutants (SDG 3.9). Nitrate is one such widespread groundwater pollutant, mainly emanating from agricultural activities and improper waste disposal, posing global health concerns like blue baby syndrome, thyroid disorders, and cancers due to prolonged exposure to high concentrations. Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in India, is known for its intensive agricultural practices, which support a vast population of about 500 million people. This study aims to investigate the geospatial distribution of nitrate concentration in IGP, along with their potential sources and associated non-carcinogenic health risks (HHR). Employing PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, this paper reviews 94 peer-reviewed articles on nitrate pollution in the groundwater reported throughout the IGP. Specifically, north-western regions of IGP were more contaminated than eastern regions. From this systemic review, it was evident that land use was the determining factor for the sources of nitrate contamination in IGP. In agricultural areas, fertilizers and manures; whereas in settlement areas, open drains and leakage from the septic tank were the major sources. HHR assessment indicates that children of age group 0-6 years were at higher health risks than adults. HHR assessment of groundwater samples of the IGP reveals that consumption of 34%, 29.3%, and 25.2% of samples may cause a potential health risk for children, males, and females, respectively. Overall, the hazard index estimate illustrates that northern and western parts had a very high potential risk of diseases for all age groups, whereas eastern regions mostly appeared safe.

AB  - BRAINSTEM CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS (CMs) continue to present a considerable source of controversy in the neurosurgical community, with an accumulating volume of literature detailing their natural history and their surgical and radiosurgical management. As part of a systematic review of the literature, 12 natural history studies, 52 surgical series, and 14 radiosurgical series were tabulated. Annual bleeding rates for brainstem CMs ranged from 2.3% to 4.1% in natural history studies and from 2.68% to 6.8% in surgical series before intervention. Rebleed rates as high as 21.5% in natural history studies and greater than once per year in surgical series were reported. A total of 684 of 745 CMs (92%) were documented as completely resected in 46 series that provided specific information on resection rates. Early postoperative morbidity ranged from 29% to 67% in larger surgical series, although it was often transient. Thirty of 61 partially resected lesions rebled; 4 of these rebleeds were fatal. Twelve additional patients died from surgically related causes for a combined postoperative rebleeding and Surgically related mortality rate of 1.9%. Across 45 series (683 patients), 85% of patients were reported as the same or improved, 14% were worse, and 1.9% died from surgically related causes at long-term follow-up. Patients with anterolateral pontine lesions generally appeared to have a better functional recovery, whereas those requiring excision via the floor of the fourth ventricle had relatively worse long-term outcomes. Radiosurgical series demonstrated conflicting data; some reported a statistically significant decrease in CM rebleeding rates after 2 years, whereas others did not, partially related to dosimetry. Postradiosurgical morbidity was nonetheless significantly greater for CMs than for arteriovenous malformations.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed dramatic changes in global food consumption patterns mainly because of population growth and economic development. Food substitutions for healthier eating, such as swapping regular servings of meat for protein-rich crops, is an emerging diet trend that may shape the future of food systems and the environment worldwide. To meet the erratic consumer demand in a rapidly changing world where resources become increasingly scarce due largely to anthropogenic activity, the need to develop crops that benefit both human health and the environment has become urgent. Legumes are often considered to be affordable plant-based sources of dietary proteins. Growing legumes provides significant benefits to cropping systems and the environment because of their natural ability to perform symbiotic nitrogen fixation, which enhances both soil fertility and water-use efficiency. In recent years, the focus in legume research has seen a transition from merely improving economically important species such as soybeans to increasingly turning attention to some promising underutilized species whose genetic resources hold the potential to address global challenges such as food security and climate change. Pulse crops have gained in popularity as an affordable source of food or feed; in fact, the United Nations designated 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, proclaiming their critical role in enhancing global food security. Given that many studies have been conducted on numerous underutilized pulse crops across the world, we provide a systematic review of the related literature to identify gaps and opportunities in pulse crop genetics research. We then discuss plausible strategies for developing and using pulse crops to strengthen food and nutrition security in the face of climate and anthropogenic changes.

AB  - Egypt has a significant role in international energy transit, being one of the major economies in the African continent. However, its energy sector is still overwhelmed with the local energy demands. It has been predicted that Egypt's CO2 emissions could increase by around 125% from 2012 to 2035 if the nation's energy demand is met using conventional power generation technologies. Given that Egypt has signed the Kyoto protocol and recognised the role of international cooperation in facing climate change, the country should focus on meeting the growing energy demand using clean energy technologies. In the meantime, Egypt has been facing many challenges due to the water scarcity issues and environmental risks arising from the lack of efficient solid waste management strategies over the last few decades. It has been predicted that the country's crude oil reserves might be depleted within the next 15 years or so. To face these challenges effectively and enforce the Egyptian role in international energy transit, renewable energy (RE) technologies and their applications should be the main focus of the current/future Egyptian energy frameworks. This review summarises the current energy outlook of Egypt while analysing the country's potential to harness energy from sustainable sources. In general, it has been found that Egypt's renewable energy sector is yet to be exploited for sustainable energy production through its diverse and plentiful resources. Eventually, two scenarios have been proposed to consider in achieving the nation's 2035 energy target, which is to generate 42% of the country's energy need through renewable sources. This study should help Egypt and other countries to set the way forward in achieving the NET ZERO target that the whole world aims to fulfil over the next few decades.

AB  - The resources of the earth are being consumed day by day with the increasing population and necessities of humankind in many areas, such as industrial applications and basic needs in houses, workplaces and transportation. As a consequence, careful usage of the energy sources and the conversed energy is of great importance in order to obtain sustainable development. Machining operations have a large percentage of all manufacturing methods in terms of depleted energy which gives them a high potential for reducing the total energy consumption. The approaches handled in the literature for the minimization of the consumed energy in the machining industry were considered in this study. While several machinability characteristics under different machining processes were investigated broadly in the context of composites and superalloys, the comparison of these systems has been given cursory attention in the current literature, specifically for cutting energy saving. The overall performance of these group material systems utilizing widely in numerous significant industrial areas supplies important signs about manufacturing costs, service conditions and environmental impacts. It is highly crucial to monitor the indicators of energy-saving phenomena of the machined parts since the mechanisms behind the energy consumption of these systems is very complex and dynamic owing to different process-induced variables. This well-organized review paper distinguishes itself from previous studies in this field since the comprehensive literature survey paves the way for diverse approaches that regard energy saving, especially for composites and superalloys under different machining operations. This overview paper aims to contribute to the current literature by highlighting the effects of the state-of-the-art approaches in reducing energy consumption in the machining of industrially important materials. This study can also establish a framework in the context of the process-property interactions to comprehend the influence of energy-saving mechanisms through machining in a system of interest.

AB  - The optimal management of pain after ambulatory anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is unclear. Femoral nerve block (FNB) is purported to enhance postoperative analgesia, but its effectiveness in the setting of modern multimodal analgesia is unclear. This systematic review examines the effect of adding FNB to multimodal analgesia on analgesic outcomes after ACLR, whether or not the analgesic regimen used included local instillation analgesia (LIA). We retrieved randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of adding FNB to multimodal analgesia on analgesic outcomes after ACLR, compared to multimodal analgesia alone (control). We designated postoperative opioid consumption at 24 hours as our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included postoperative opioid consumption at 24-48 hours, rest, and dynamic pain severity between 0 and 48 hours, time to analgesic request, postanesthesia care unit and hospital stay durations, patient satisfaction, postoperative nausea and vomiting, functional outcomes, and long-term (>1 month) quadriceps strength. Eight randomized controlled trials (716 patients) were identified. Five trials compared FNB administration to control, and another 3 compared the combination of FNB and LIA to LIA alone. Compared to control, adding FNB resulted in modest reductions in 24-hour opioid consumption in 2 of 3 trials, and improvements in rest pain at 1 hour in 1 trial and up to 24 hours in another. In contrast, the combination of FNB and LIA, compared to LIA alone, did not reduce opioid consumption in any of the trials, but it did improve pain scores at 20 minutes only in 1 trial. The effect of FNB on long-term quadriceps strength or function after ACLR was not evaluated in the reviewed trials. Contemporary evidence suggests that the benefits of adding FNB to multimodal analgesia for ACLR are modest and conflicting, but there is no incremental analgesic benefit if the multimodal analgesic regimen included LIA. Our findings do not support the routine use of FNB for analgesia in patients having ACLR.

AB  - Purpose: Pain is a comorbid and aggravating symptom that in many conditions can be perceived differently and should therefore be managed accordingly. Numerous factors, both social and cultural, are thought to influence the analgesic prescription. However, elucidation of such areas is limited. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review to test the hypothesis that variations in provider characteristics predict the prescription of pain medication.
   Methods: A MEDLINE and PsycINFO database search from 1960 to 2009 was conducted using the search terms of "pain" or "pain treatment" along with culture, ethnicity, race, minority, gender/sex, knowledge, attitudes, physician-patient relationship, stereotype, and physician practices. Twelve original research articles based on predefined inclusion criteria were identified and analyzed to test the hypothesis of provider characteristics influencing analgesics prescription.
   Results: Of the 12 studies, 11 were cross-sectional in design, and 10 used a survey instrument or clinical vignettes to measure different pain management responses. A randomized sampling methodology was used in 5 of the studies. The majority of providers were male 64.9% in 8 studies), white 73.5% in 5 studies), internal medicine physicians 37.4% in 11 studies), and located in the United States (75% across all 12 studies). Ten studies identified at least one provider characteristic that influenced prescription practices; age, level of experience, as well as sex were listed most frequently as contributing factors. The interplay of the sex of the provider and patient characteristics were found to be important variables in pain management.
   Conclusions: Our systematic review of existing literature highlights that provider's age, sex, experience, specialty, and the interplay between provider and patient characteristics are important variables in pain management. However, generalizations relating to these findings are limited by the heterogeneity of the studies and the paucity of literature in this field.

AB  - Nanotechnology has become the foremost promising and rising field of analysis as a result of its applications in numerous fields. Development of consistent and greener ways for the synthesis of nanoparticles could be a dynamic step in the field of nanotechnology. To avoid the emergence of dangerous by-products, many attempts have been made in recent years to develop environment friendly methods. "Green" synthesis is a consistent, sustainable, and environment friendly method for the synthesis of an enormous range of nanoparticles. Green synthesis is seen as an important tool to reduce the harmful effects of traditional nanoparticle synthesis methods commonly used in laboratories and industries. Nanoparticles exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that are useful in various fields. Among metallic nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles have become a research hotspot due to their wide range of applications. Silver nanoparticles are important because of their exceptional chemical, physical, and biological properties. Because of these unique characteristics, silver nanoparticles have numerous applications and are used as antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial agents. They have an excellent catalytic effect on dye degradation, are very good antioxidants, and can be used to treat various diseases and exhibit wound-healing activities. The current review complies with the database of green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using plant extracts, bacteria, and fungi, which have potential applications in fields of science, health, textiles, food packaging, agriculture, and environment. The review also highlights the application of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents. The knowledge on silver nanoparticle production conditions, properties, molecular mechanisms, and applications will be of great help for researchers to explore more applications of nanoparticles in fields that are still untouched.

AB  - Introduction: In this short review, the effect of climate change on nature and human health with a special focus on infectious diseases in the Mediterranean region is discussed. This research is a part of the Mediterranean Convention of Human Rights project, which is an organizational work on human rights issues that was established in cooperation with civil society and the national authorities of the Mediterranean Region. Methodology: Previously published data were collected by retrieving published literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using "climate change", "the Mediterranean region", "infections in Mediterranean Region", "infectious diseases", "biodiversity", and "the Mediterranean Sea" as keywords. The collected data were then evaluated and reviewed. The recommendations and guidelines were analysed by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Conclusions: The Mediterranean region presents a typical example witnessing a dramatic change in climate events and their adverse impact on biodiversity, ecosystems and public health are multiple. This negative impact is in part due to the geographical particularities, and sociocultural and geopolitical conflicts that are progressively worsening the burden of climate change. While most of these changes cannot be totally avoided, many of the health risks related to climate change could be monitored. This can be done by establishing health systems with policies to reduce and prevent the risks of infectious diseases and to recover and support the affected areas, which may identify priority and management of highrisk events.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse the concept of smart homes and discuss how these homes can be adopted sustainably in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), considering the region's socio-economic characteristics. The paper dwelt largely on a review of literature on the subject, which was accessed from a wide range of databases using online search engines and by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicate that smart homes enhance the comfort of the dwellers, ensure the diversification of energy sources and use, promote inclusiveness in the provision of housing and present an avenue for environmental cleanliness. Based on these benefits, and in an era of sustainable cities, the authorities of the cities in North America and Europe are encouraging the adoption of smart homes by urbanites. However, there is insufficient data to assess the level of adoption of smart housing in SSA although anecdotally the rate of adoption may be low. This is partly attributed to the region's low levels of literacy, income and technological penetration. The paper recommends the strengthening of local economies, creating awareness about the value of smart homes, creating smart home incentives and adapting the design of affordable housing schemes to assume the nature of smart homes as good strategies to foster a sustainable adoption of smart housing in the sub-region.

AB  - Population growth and improving living standards are leading to a growing demand for beef. The understorey in the 19 million hectares of oil palm plantation worldwide represent a source of cattle feed, while also sparing additional land conversion for grazing. Research on cattle grazing under oil palm is novel and knowledge is lacking on long-term profitability and sustainability of the system, a major deterrent to cattle-oil palm farming system adoption. Here we review the current literature on cattle grazing in oil palm plantations, to highlight the knowns and unknowns of grazing impacts on the understorey, cattle and oil palm productivity, as well as economic implications. This review's major outcomes are the following: (i) although understorey utilization as feed is a major advantage of cattle-oil palm integrated farming systems, declining understorey productivity under ageing plantation indicates the need for alternative solutions for sustained cattle productivity over the plantation's lifecycle; (ii) oil palm yields were reported to increase under cattle integration but evidence was weak, both oil palm yields and the pathways through which oil palm yields are impacted by cattle grazing should be further explored; (iii) economic analyses showed cattle grazing under oil palm plantations was profitable for large-scale oil palm producers due to cattle sales, and returns were further enhanced by reductions in weeding and fertilizer costs; (iv) sustainable cattle grazing was found to be difficult in smallholder oil palm plantations due to land constraints and the current practice of free-grazing; options for improving grazing sustainability and profitability in these systems should be explored. This systematic review concluded that cattle integration in oil palm plantations has great potential but further research is required to develop locally specific productive and sustainable systems of grazed cattle integration with oil palm plantations.

AB  - Background It has been more than five years since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, which seek to improve the well-being of people and the planet and strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. While these major international commitments have spurred a lot of policy debates and academic research, a synthesis of how their adoption has shaped the academic discussions in pursuit of these goals in specific sectors such as energy is limited. Using a systematic review method following the PRISMA procedure, we examine the emergent trends in the academic discussions on the linkage between these international agendas and energy with a specific reference to policy-based research publications.
   Results Our analysis found that many studies on this subject are predictive/prescriptive, attempting to forecast and map out various pathways by which these international commitments may be achieved. Studies on the progress of implementation of policies and their impacts on these goals are somewhat limited. The three most common policy-related issues identified by the studies reviewed are lack of integrated/cross-sectoral planning, narrow emphasis on energy justice in policies, and the need for more cost-effective strategies in pursuit of the Paris Agreement.
   Conclusions This study revealed emerging trends in energy debates and policy discourse within academic discussions addressing the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. Research on the progress of implementation, impacts and critical lessons from current policy efforts to achieve these global agendas are needed. Country case studies, in particular, can encourage policy-learning through cross-country comparisons, which can inform regional and domestic energy policies towards achieving the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Financial (positive or negative) and non-financial incentives or rewards are increasingly used in attempts to influence health behaviours. While unintended consequences of incentive provision are discussed in the literature, evidence syntheses did not identify any primary research with the aim of investigating unintended consequences of incentive interventions for lifestyle behaviour change. Our objective was to investigate perceived positive and negative unintended consequences of incentive provision for a shortlist of seven promising incentive strategies for smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A multi-disciplinary, mixed-methods approach included involving two service-user mother and baby groups from disadvantaged areas with experience of the target behaviours as study co-investigators. Systematic reviews informed the shortlist of incentive strategies. Qualitative semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey of health professionals asked open questions on positive and negative consequences of incentives. The participants from three UK regions were a diverse sample with and without direct experience of incentive interventions: 88 pregnant women/recent mothers/partners/family members; 53 service providers; 24 experts/decision makers and interactive discussions with 63 conference attendees. Maternity and early years health professionals (n = 497) including doctors, midwives, health visitors, public health and related staff participated in the survey. Qualitative analysis identified ethical, political, cultural, social and psychological implications of incentive delivery at population and individual levels. Four key themes emerged: how incentives can address or create inequalities; enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation and wellbeing; have a positive or negative effect on relationships with others within personal networks or health providers; and can impact on health systems and resources by raising awareness and directing service delivery, but may be detrimental to other health care areas. Financial incentives are controversial and generated emotive and oppositional responses. The planning, design and delivery of future incentive interventions should evaluate unexpected consequences to inform the evidence for effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and future implementation.

AB  - The elderly population is relatively vulnerable to air pollution and thermal stress due to their low mobility and high prevalence of chronic disorders. Appropriate green infrastructure (GI) deployment can improve both the indoor and outdoor air quality and thermal environments of elderly care centres (ECCs), yet a systematic review on this topic area is lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by investigating the impacts of GI on ECC building environment and presents the approaches for integrating GI into the building environment design. We discussed the significance of linking air quality with the thermal environment to ECCs and the effects of GI on the elderly's physical health. We investigated the key design considerations for GI in ECC buildings (e.g., spatial layout, species, aesthetics and fire prevention). Also, the diversity of monitoring and modelling approaches for evaluating the benefits of GI in indoor and outdoor environments was assessed. Finally, we evaluated the associated challenges and provided design recommendations for improving the environments in and around the ECC buildings (e.g., bedrooms, indoor gardens, green roofs and courtyards). The quantitative evidence for linking GI with indoor and outdoor air pollution and extreme heat around the ECC buildings are limited. However, this evidence-base is important for providing generic advice to the building designers and the elderly. Further studies such as the evaluation criteria and monitoring standard are required to develop holistic design recommendations for ECC buildings. The empirical research about the social and economic impacts is also necessary to facilitate the sustainable development of the ageing societies.

AB  - Background: Nonpharmacological therapies are often recommended as a first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia in long term care (LTC); however, little is known about which nonpharmacological interventions are most effective for NPS in LTC or the feasibility of interventions, given the availability of resources in typical LTC environments.
   Methods: We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO (1980-2010), the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using keywords and medical subject headings for randomized, controlled trials evaluating nonpharmacological interventions for NPS conducted in LTC settings. Change in severity of NPS symptoms was evaluated through the NPS outcomes measures reported in studies. We assessed study quality and described the feasibility of interventions based on various aspects of study design.
   Results: A total of 40 studies met inclusion criteria. Sixteen (40%) of 40 included studies reported statistically significant results in favor of nonpharmacological interventions on at least one measure of NPS. These interventions included staff training in NPS management strategies, mental health consultation and treatment planning, exercise, recreational activities, and music therapy or other forms of sensory stimulation. Many of the studies had methodological limitations that placed them at potential risk of bias. Most interventions (n = 30, 75%) required significant resources from services outside of LTC or significant time commitments from LTC nursing staff for implementation.
   Conclusions: There are several nonpharmacological interventions that may be effective for NPS in LTC, although there are a limited number of large-scale, high-quality studies in this area. The feasibility of some interventions will be limited in many LTC settings and further research into practical and sustainable interventions for NPS in LTC is required to improve usage of these important treatments.

AB  - In a mineral separation process such as in the production of metals, the embodied exergy used in the process is important for sustainability. Currently, using or elaborating embodied exergy indicators are relevant in metal production according to ore grades, once the decline in ore grades requires more exergy in metal production processes. Mineral reserves are limited and there is a tendency in increasing mineral demand, specifically for the rarest of which. This article aims to identify whether there is a published measurable proportion used to evaluate embodied exergy involved in metal production as an ore grade function. A systematic longitudinal review through thematic areas and subdomains is the main methodology applied in this paper, with a wide review ranging from the years 1847-2020, and a more specific review ranging from 1973 to 2020. In these reviews keywords such as: metals, ore-deposits, minerals, ore-grades, life-cycle, mining-industry and exergy were obtained, revealing that most reviewed articles relate earth's crust mineral concentration to the mining industry. Three research groups declare that when ore grades tend to zero, embodied energy/exergy involved in metal productions increases. None of the articles from the three groups of researchers we reviewed use a direct proportion between ore-grades and an embodied exergy. We suggest a useful proportional measurement, which is: "for each 50% mineral concentration variation, at least 100% additional exergy is used in the process. In a spontaneous or natural process, this proportion is possibly 100% variation in the exergy used for every 50% variation in the concentration of matter. This can help to assess the exergetic efficiency of technological systems and natural systems.

AB  - BackgroundEarly accurate diagnosis and sustainable availability of affordable medicines and diagnostic tests is fundamental in optimal management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We systematically reviewed original research articles about availability and affordability of medicines and diagnostic tests recommended for management of asthma and COPD in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).MethodsWe searched PubMed, Scopus and African Journal Online for original research articles conducted in SSA between 2000 and March 2018 containing information about availability and affordability of any recommended medicine and diagnostic test for asthma and COPD.ResultsThe search yielded 9 eligible research articles. Availability of short-acting beta agonists (SABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short acting anti-muscarinic agents (SAMA) ranged between 19.9-100%, 0-45.5% and 0-14.3% respectively. Combination of ICS-long acting beta agonists (LABA) were available in 0-14.3% of facilities surveyed. There was absence of inhaled long acting anti-muscarinic agents (LAMA) and LAMA/LABA combinations. Spirometry and peak expiratory flow devices were available in 24.4-29.4% and 6.7-53.6% respectively. Affordability of SABA and ICS varied greatly, ranging from<2 to 107days' wages while ICS-LABA combinations, SAMA and oral theophylline plus leukotriene receptor antagonists cost 6.4-17.1, 13.7 and 6.9days' wages respectively.ConclusionAvailability and affordability of medicines and diagnostics recommended for the management of asthma and COPD is a big challenge in SSA. Research about this subject in this region is still limited. More robustly performed studies are required to further understand the magnitude of inequity in access to these medicines and diagnostic tests in SSA and also to formulate simple pragmatic solutions to address this challenge.

AB  - Manure is a livestock residue that causes high environmental burdens in different categories. Its usage in biogas production is an environmentally beneficial way not only to reduce these impacts, but also to produce energy and biofertilizers. Although manure has low energy value and low biogas conversion efficiency, it is indicated for use in co-digestion with other substrates to produce biogas. The present work provides a systematic review of studies that have analyzed the production cycle of biogas from manure around the world, to detect and compare the critical points of the life cycle assessment (LCA) steps defined by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), as well as the biogas process steps. The critical points related to LCA structure in the analyzed articles involve the different boundaries considered, since the initial stage varies from one that considers only the input of raw material in the digestion process, to the one that considers the upstream steps to obtain the substrate. Despite this, the comparison of LCA structure in the analyzed articles is possible, since the ISO standards contain well-defined parameters and steps. The critical points in biogas production processes involve different variables in regional case studies, such as climate, raw material availability, transportation distance, source of inputs and energy, plant location and technological development level, hindering comparison between studies. In relation to the level of technologies, no details of industrial steps were observed in the LCA studies of manure biogas. In spite of the difficulty, comparison between stages is developed in this work to allow careful evaluation of critical points and environmental impacts, and consequently to help establish regional sustainability strategies for the production of biogas from manure.

AB  - BackgroundPeer support is an important supplement to medical resources for persons living with HIV (PLHIV). However, previous studies have shown mixed results about intervention effects. It is necessary to explain the mechanism of peer support interventions' effectiveness and sustainability to help design more valid peer support interventions.ObjectiveTo identify and explain the mechanisms that drive the effectiveness and maintain the sustainability of peer support interventions.MethodsA preliminary theoretical framework was developed through a scoping review of the grey literature and international project frameworks in five professional websites. We then refined the framework by systematically searching evidence in databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL, CNKI and Wanfang. Qualitative methods were used to generate codes and themes relating to the studies' context, mechanisms and outcomes. We checked chains of inference (connections) across extracted data and themes through an iterative process.ResultsA total of 6345 articles were identified, and 52 articles were retained for final synthesis. The refined theoretical framework presents five areas of peer support, including informational support, instrumental support, emotional support, affiliational support and appraisal support; five types of outcomes that peer support can improve for PLHIV, including physiological outcomes, psychological outcomes, behavioural outcomes, cognitive outcomes and social outcomes; the effectiveness mechanism coding system from peer volunteers and the relationship between peer volunteers and PLHIV; and the sustainability mechanism coding system in terms of peer volunteers, PLHIV and study context.ConclusionsGiven that peer support has huge potential human resources, that is, all the qualified PLHIV, irreplaceable advantages in dealing with barriers to HIV-related discrimination and potential comprehensive benefits for PLHIV, it is necessary to develop and organise more peer support projects for PLHIV. Our study highlights that the expansion of peer support projects should be based on their effectiveness and sustainability.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022339079.

AB  - PURPOSE Although the family history is increasingly used for genetic risk assessment of common chronic diseases in primary care, evidence suggests that lay understanding about inheritance may conflict with medical models. This study systematically reviewed and synthesized the qualitative literature exploring understanding about familial risk held by persons with a family history of cancer, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus.
   METHODS Twenty-two qualitative articles were found after a comprehensive literature search and were critically appraised; 11 were included. A meta-ethnographic approach was used to translate the studies across each other, synthesize the translation, and express the synthesis.
   RESULTS A dynamic process emerged by which a personal sense of vulnerability included some features that mirror the medical factors used to assess risk, such as the number of affected relatives. Other features are more personal, such as experience of a relative's disease, sudden or premature death, perceived patterns of illness relating to gender or age at death, and comparisons between a person and an affected relative. The developing vulnerability is interpreted using personal mental models, including models of disease causation, inheritance, and fatalism. A person's sense of vulnerability affects how that person copes with, and attempts to control, any perceived familial risk.
   CONCLUSIONS Persons with a family history of a common chronic disease develop a personal sense of vulnerability that is informed by the salience of their family history and interpreted within their personal models of disease causation and inheritance. Features that give,meaning to familial risk may be perceived differently by patients and professionals. This review identifies key areas for health professionals to explore with patients that may improve the effectiveness of communication about disease risk and management.

AB  - The environmental crisis of global warming and rising oil prices have contributed to the spread of electric vehicles (EVs) since the 2010s. As the global EV fleet grows, a broad scientific literature on EVs is emerging. This literature, while abundant, is still concentrated on very limited geographical regions, mainly Europe, North America, and China, offering little analysis of, or comparison with, markets outside these areas, especially Africa. In both EV deployment and scientific production, Africa could seem to be lagging behind, yet there is some growing momentum for EVs in Africa. This paper examines the place of EVs as a research object and practical alternative to conventional vehicles in Africa. It is based on a twofold methodological approach combining a systematic review of scientific literature and an overview of electric mobility projects on the continent. The results reveal a growing interest in EVs in Africa over the past decade, in both publications and projects. Nevertheless, this growth masks strong disparities in the distribution of projects and papers. In addition, academic research is only weakly related to ongoing electric mobility projects in Africa, with few field experiments in the methodological approaches used by the authors, and, above all, several thematic aspects absent from EV research.

AB  - There has been no scarcity in the literature of suggested antecedents of employee safety behavior, and this paper brings together the disaggregated antecedents of safety behavior in the construction field. In total, 101 eligible empirical articles are obtained. Bibliometric and context analyses are combined to identify the influential journals, scholars, keywords, use of theory, research methods, and countries or regions of the empirical samples. The 83 factors that are identified are divided into five groups, namely (a) individual characteristics, (b) workgroup interactions, (c) work and workplace design, (d) project management and organization, and (e) family, industry, and society. This indicates that the causes of safety behavior are manifold. Various factors from different systems likely work in concert to create situations in which an individual chooses to comply with safety rules and participate voluntarily in safety activities. Given this, we propose that safety behavior is only an ostensible symptom of more complex "The Self-Work-Home-Industry/Society" systems and establish a safety behavior antecedent analysis and classification model. Based on this model, we develop a resource flow model, illustrating why, how, and when the flow of resources between the five systems-namely the self system, work system, home system, work-home interface system, and industry/society system-either promotes or inhibits safety behavior. The safety behavior antecedent analysis and classification model and resource flow model are based mainly on bioecological system theory and resources theories. Avenues for future theoretical development and method designs are suggested based on the reviewed findings and the two conceptual models. The intention with this systematic review together with the two integrated conceptual models is to advance theoretical thinking on how safety behavior can be promoted, or instead, inhibited.

AB  - Recently the waste of asphalt pavement materials has been increasing in day-to-day life by cost and economic criteria in the Indian environment. In this regard, the use of recycled asphalt pavement has grown worldwide reducing the use of virgin materials. Besides, the scarcity of natural aggregates, as well as the lack of eco-friendly materials, lead to an increase in the utilization of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) as an alternative material in road construction. This paper provides a comprehensive and insightful evaluation of the utilization of RAP aggregates based on characterization, strength, durability, and micro-structure properties along with life cycle analysis (LCA). For this purpose, a sequential characterization of the RAP materials is employed for a detailed analysis using physical and mechanical properties. Further, RAP aggregates' fresh and hardened properties, including durability properties, have been presented to show the potential utility as a partial substitute for natural aggregates (NA). Thus, the main objective of this critical review is to develop an extensive understanding of the present scenario in the utilization of RAP materials and identify the different properties needed for sustainability in pavement structures. Consequently, the various research gaps are highlighted based on the material properties, strength parameters, and circular economy of environmental impacts. Moreover, the optimum proportions of these substitute materials have been recommended for sustainable rigid pavement systems. The literature showed that the effect of RAP aggregates in concrete leads to loss of mechanical properties, which can be compensated by using various mineral admixtures or stabilizers to improve their strength and durability performance. Hence, this in-depth review will help the researchers, pavement engineers, and authorities of national and state highways with the effective use of RAP aggregates in rigid pavement construction.

AB  - The agricultural sector is the second major source of climate change globally, contributing to anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In low-to-middle income countries, estimations indicate future increases in agricultural emissions. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) has an express opportunity to transform agriculture across the globe. In Africa, CSA targets focused on resilience building and food security with less emphasis on the GHG mitigation potential. Nevertheless, to make CSA conclusive as an express low emission development strategy in Africa, understanding the mitigation potential in this context is paramount. Through a systematic-narrative review approach conducted on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), the study aimed to identify opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions in Africa. We observed that the distribution of studies that quantitatively assessed the GHG emissions of CSA practices was disproportionate across Africa. For instance, out of twenty studies evaluated, nine were conducted in Southern Africa; three in East Africa, and the rest distributed among Central, Western, and North Africa. Observed in the studies, advanced livestock breeding and feeding, organic nitrogen input, improved pastures and switching land-use practices, all contributed to GHG emission reduction. As limited experimental evidence exist on the GHG mitigation potential for some of the CSA alternatives including agroforestry, rotational farming, improved livestock breed and intensification of ruminants' diet, we recommend further experimental studies into these alternatives in more locations/contexts in Africa. Also, progress on the mitigation pillar is still limited in Africa due to lack of the necessary analytical infrastructure to conduct the needed measurements. We call for urgent investments into laboratory facilities and skills training to improve data collection and quality.

AB  - Spatial justice is a theoretical framework that is increasingly used to examine questions of equity in the low carbon transition (LCT) from a geographical perspective. We conducted a semi-systematic review to define a 'spatially just' low carbon transition, considering how spatial dimensions are explicitly or implicitly presented in assessments of the LCT, and the policy and governance approaches that could embed spatial justice. A sample of 75 academic articles was thematically coded. Spatial justice involves the fair distribution of both benefits and burdens associated with LCTs, and this often creates problems of equity given the geographic gap between regions that 'win and lose'. The studies point to a research gap in exploring fairness implications that go beyond the employment impacts of transition. Acceptance of the LCT is shown to be contingent on perceptions of justice, particularly whether the most responsible and capable actors are taking action. There is similar concern that the LCT may not address, or may reproduce, existing patterns of injustice. This is particularly the case in terms of spatially inequitable land uses and where historic planning policy has had lasting socioeconomic impacts. Policy challenges to making LCTs more spatially just included administrative fragmentation across spatial scales and the lack of coordination in net zero policy. We identify that future transition policymaking could benefit from using spatially targeted interventions, and in adopting a whole systems approach. In this recognition of the multiple economic vulnerabilities of different regions, LCT policymaking can become both more effective and, critically, more just.

AB  - As urbanization continues to expand across the globe, urban wildlife research is critical for urban planners and conservation practitioners to create livable cities for both humans and wildlife. In 2012, Magle et al. conducted a foundational review on the status of urban wildlife research. The authors described the status of urban wildlife research as of 2010 and offered suggestions for future advancements in the field. We conducted a systematic review following Magle et al. (2012) to provide a 10-year update on the state of urban wildlife research globally and describe recent advancements in the field. We also conducted a broader literature search to further explore current research trends and continuing research gaps within the urban wildlife field. We found that urban wildlife publications have continued to increase within the last decade. However, the sectors conducting the research and the geographical location of publications stayed relatively the same. Similarly, the predominant taxa studied were mammals and birds across the 2000-2020 decades. After broadening our literature search, we were able to identify a new emphasis on management-related research and research in the fields of disease ecology, social science, and methodological development. Critical knowledge gaps remain, however, as there was still a significant lack of studies on herptiles, arthropods, and fish. Additionally, studies from Africa, South America, and Asia - three of the fastest urbanizing continents - were underrepresented. Our results provide conservation practitioners a summary of emerging topics and recommendations for future research that will contribute to creating healthier and more livable cities for both wildlife and people.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 and the challenges it posed to communities around the world, demonstrated the necessity of enhancing the resilience of communities to pandemics. In this regard, assessment frameworks can play an essential role and guide resilience-building efforts. However, the lack of a comprehensive assessment framework has led to a focus on sectoral evaluation. This study aims to propose an integrated framework for assessing the pandemic resilience of communities. For this purpose, we rely on a systematic review of literature indexed in major academic databases. We have thoroughly analyzed a total number of 115 related doc-uments to extract relevant criteria. Findings show that many criteria and factors affect community resilience to pandemics. By inductive content coding in MAXQDA software, we have categorized these criteria into five dimensions of Institutional, Social, Economic, Infrastructural, and De-mographic. Good leadership and management, insurance and governmental support, planning and preparation, expertise and labor, and available equipment and technologies are the most important institutional criteria. Communication and collective identity, mutual support, public safety and protection, public awareness, and social justice are the influential social criteria. Economic sustainability and resource availability are criteria of economic resilience. Sufficiency of services, public spaces, housing tenure, and transportation system are the main criteria related to the built environment and infrastructural dimension. Finally, demographic resilience includes physical health, psychological well-being, life quality, and hygiene. Based on these criteria, this study develops an integrated evaluation framework that researchers can implement along with conventional assessment and ranking methods to determine the level of community resilience to pandemics.

AB  - Drought and salinity are two of the most urgent challenges faced in Mediterranean ecosystems, equally impacting natural systems, agricultural crops, and urban green. While many technical and soft approaches have been proposed to anticipate, mitigate, and remediate these impacts, a class of solutions has possibly been in front of us all along. Native Mediterranean fauna is well adapted, and when properly established still has unexploited conservation, restoration, and production diversification potential. Here, we outline the results of a long-term experiment taking place on the island of Crete, Greece that started in 1996 and involves over 70 native Mediterranean plants planted and monitored in various green spaces (private, shared, public) and a university campus under a diversity of adverse topographies (e.g., coastal, steep slopes), soils (e.g., disturbed, nutrient-deficient), and microclimatic conditions, taking various plant formations and serving various functions. After plant establishment, drought and salinity resistance were evaluated by gradually exposing plants (n = 5249) to deficit irrigation and saline environmental conditions, and plants were followed up for at least 5 years to empirically assess their ability to cope with abiotic stress. From the Mediterranean plants that were planted and tested, 52 were singled out because of their resistance and additional favorable traits. Motivated by this long-term assessment, a systematic literature review was conducted using the protocol Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to validate empirical results, determine which were still unexplored, and bring to light additional uses. Results showed that 41 of the plants included in this research have significant medicinal properties, 26 have nutritional uses, 17 industrial uses, and 18 have evidence of cosmetology uses. Additionally, the empirical assessment gave new evidence of at least 40 new species-trait combinations. By formally documenting the characteristics of these native Mediterranean plants, this work highlights their versatile traits, and the prospect of creating new uses and value chains enables, for the first time their inclusion in planting-decision support systems and aims to increase demand and facilitate the scaling up of native greening in the context of sustainable land and water management within and beyond the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - The united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO) considers the historic urban landscapes as the world heritages. Managing historic city centers and maintaining historic cores are the emerging challenges for sustainable urban planning. Today, the historic cores form an important part of the economic, social, environmental, and physical assets and capacities of contemporary cities, and play a strategic role in their development. One of the most important approaches to the development of central textures, especially in historical and cultural cities, is the sustainable urban regeneration approach, which encompasses all aspects of sustainability, such as the economic, social, cultural and environmental aspects. To maintain sustainability and regeneration of historic cores of cities, it is necessary to provide insight into the underlying characteristics of the local urbanization. Furthermore, the fundamental assets are to be investigated as indicators of sustainable regeneration and drivers of urban development. In the meantime, a variety of research and experience has taken place around the world, all of which has provided different criteria and indicators for the development of strategies for the historic cores of cities. The present study, through a meta-analytic and survey method, analyzing the experience and research reported in 139 theoretical and empirical papers in the last twenty years, seeks to provide a comprehensive conceptual model taking into account the criteria and indices of sustainable regeneration in historic cores of cities. The quality of the survey has been ensured using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA).

AB  - Halting the global decline of freshwater mussels requires an improved understanding of the restoration approaches currently in use and the identification of shortcomings to inform the development of new ones. This article reviews published evaluations of restoration efforts on the ground and those identified or proposed in the literature. This review found few reports of the effectiveness of restoration measures, and of those reported there was strong temporal and geographical bias. Reports were mostly recent and took place within mussel-diverse regions of the Global North (i.e. North America, Europe). Efforts focused on population support encompassed relocation, translocation and population augmentation from captive breeding, and potential restoration approaches emphasized planning and prioritization. It was challenging to assess restoration success owing to differences in success metrics and varied lengths of post-restoration monitoring. Some measures were inherently more species specific, such as population support, but some articles suggested that the use of multiple measures may allow more species to be addressed by restoration efforts. Consistent documentation and reporting of restoration measures - including failed ones - are needed to advance freshwater mussel restoration. In addition, continued work is needed to accelerate and better align the development and use of restoration approaches for freshwater mussels. Reporting of unsuccessful or partially successful attempts does not adequately reflect the long life histories of freshwater mussels. Investigation of the contexts where approaches have been effective (even partially), and concerted efforts to implement combinations of measures at a catchment scale are critical for unionids globally. As such, recommendations are posed to aid integration of research and practice to advance and further develop freshwater mussel restoration.

AB  - Globally, agriculture has intensified during the past 50 years due to increased mechanization, changes in the dining of fanning operations, grassland conversion to cropland, and increased agrochemical inputs. Birds associated with farmlands and grasslands in North America have experienced severe declines over the last several decades, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of the drivers, mechanisms and magnitude of effects on bird populations. Here we evaluated changes in North American farmland bird populations over time and conducted a systematic review and analysis of the published literature to identify the major causes. Based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data, populations of 57 of 77 (74%) farmland-associated species decreased from 1966 to 2013. Multiple species exhibited highly congruent declines during the 1960s-1980s - a period with rapid changes in fanning practices to low tillage systems, heavy pesticide use and widespread conversion of grassland habitat to cropland. The most severe declines occurred in aerial insectivorous birds (average change of - 39.5% from 1966 to 2013), followed by grassland (-20.8%) and shrubland (-16.5%) bird species. Direct agricultural drivers impacting bird abundance, survival, and reproduction include loss of natural habitats, interference from farming equipment, and direct mortality or sublethal effects from pesticide exposure. Subtle interference with behaviour or physiology are reported through indirect drivers such as reduced food supplies, sublethal pesticide toxicity, habitat fragmentation and alteration, and disturbance. Indirect effects are likely significant for many species, particularly aerial insectivores, but detailed mechanistic studies are lacking. Our review of 122 studies found that pesticides (42% of all studies), followed by habitat loss or alterations (27%), were most predominant in negatively affecting farmland birds, with pesticides (93% negative) and mowing/harvesting (81% negative) having the most consistently negative effects. Modifications to farmland management such as reducing pesticide inputs through integrated pest management and maintaining or restoring uncultivated field margins and native habitat could positively influence farmland birds without significantly reducing agricultural crop yields.

AB  - The nexus of food, energy, and water systems (FEWS) has become a salient research topic, as well as a pressing societal and policy challenge. Computational modeling is a key tool in addressing these challenges, and FEWS modeling as a subfield is now established. However, social dimensions of FEWS nexus issues, such as individual or social learning, technology adoption decisions, and adaptive behaviors, remain relatively underdeveloped in FEWS modeling and research. Agent-based models (ABMs) have received increasing usage recently in efforts to better represent and integrate human behavior into FEWS research. A systematic review identified 29 articles in which at least two food, energy, or water sectors were explicitly considered with an ABM and/or ABM-coupled modeling approach. Agent decision-making and behavior ranged from reactive to active, motivated by primarily economic objectives to multi-criteria in nature, and implemented with individual-based to highly aggregated entities. However, a significant proportion of models did not contain agent interactions, or did not base agent decision-making on existing behavioral theories. Model design choices imposed by data limitations, structural requirements for coupling with other simulation models, or spatial and/or temporal scales of application resulted in agent representations lacking explicit decision-making processes or social interactions. In contrast, several methodological innovations were also noted, which were catalyzed by the challenges associated with developing multi-scale, cross-sector models. Several avenues for future research with ABMs in FEWS research are suggested based on these findings. The reviewed ABM applications represent progress, yet many opportunities for more behaviorally rich agent-based modeling in the FEWS context remain.

AB  - The resource nexus consists of a framework to address interlinkages between natural resources and systems that provide water, energy, food and waste management. It transcends traditional assessments conducted in "silos", raising trade-offs and synergies that are rarely acknowledged. The nexus framework is intrinsically context specific, as each respective region has particularities in terms of critical interlinkages. Brazil is the world's eighth largest economy [1] and is heavily reliant on natural resources. This paper considers Brazil to be a textbook case for nexus research that identifies critical interlinkages that are neglected by literature, which is typically based on single-resource analysis. It proposes a research agenda to advance resource nexus assessments and improve resource governance in Brazil. We propose a novel method for nexus research, systematically reviewing geographical context-specific papers in relevant single nexus dimensions and establishing resource interlinkages that characterise research gaps and policy priorities. We found that 36% of practices reviewed involve more than one resource at a time, characterising interlinkages not analysed by the literature. Lastly, selected quantitative indicators were used to identify critical interlinkages by analysing the representativeness of practices in the national context, and the relevance of synergies or trade-offs for Brazil. Critical interlinkages in Brazil were found to be irrigation for energy crop expansion (water, food and energy); transport biofuels and fuelwood (water, energy, food); deforestation for new pasture (water, energy, food); and hydropower generation (water and energy). These are, therefore, priorities for future nexus research and for efforts to address synergies and trade-offs in resource governance.

AB  - The aim of this study was to summarise the literature reporting the risk factors for mortality in the mussel speciesMytilus edulisandMytilus galloprovincialisin order to identify potential science-based solutions to prevent or mitigate mussel mortality outbreaks. We followed the PRISMA methodology: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The studied corpus of 91 publications (114 studies) was highly heterogeneous with respect to the methodological approaches used to define or estimate mussel mortality and the related putative risk factors. Results showed that the mortality risk of both mussel speciesM. edulisandM. galloprovincialisvaried across the seasons, increased with an elevated seawater temperature above a thermal threshold of 20 and 24 degrees C, respectively, decreased by protecting mussels from predation, and was associated with the presence of pathogens inM. edulis. ForM. galloprovincialis, using mussel spat from the same area where the farming is carried out and farming them together with another mussel species appears to reduce the mortality risk. However, forM. edulis, this could be achieved by using pure crosses and in particular mussel spat having a selected genotype. For wild bed conservation, sand accumulation and anthropogenic sedimentation should be minimised. Our analysis showed that current approaches to this research topic are limited and are unlikely to yield actionable evidence to identify mussel mortality prevention or mitigation strategies. Therefore, recommendations are offered to increase the ability of future eco-epidemiological research to identify multiple exposures associated with mussel mortality, underpinned by standardised efforts and cooperative initiatives.

AB  - Given the increasing vulnerabilities and adverse effects of climate change, the development and implementation of adaptation strategies is essential. This is particularly so for Nepal where the agriculture sector - the mainstay of the country's economy - is highly vulnerable to climate change. As a country that loses much from climate change, local communities here have been adapting to climate change impacts using localized knowledge and practices. However, few studies have systematically reviewed the adaptation strategies of Nepalese farmers. We conduct such a review using the RepOrting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) guidelines. The relevant literature is retrieved using Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. The adaptation strategies of the Nepalese farmers are broadly categorized under seven themes and twenty-nine sub-themes: (a) access to financial resources and risk transfer; (b) diversification of livelihoods, income sources and agricultural practices; (c) spatial adaptation; (d) climate smart agriculture; (e) common pooling of resources and social action; (f) traditional and local knowledge; and (g) food and water storage and security. Diversification of livelihoods, income sources and agricultural practices are the most common adaptation strategies employed. All the strategies practiced are autonomous, have a short term orientation and reactive in nature rather than being sustainable and proactive. The outputs of this study explore the significance of the local adaptation strategies and to what extent they should be integrated into the mainstream of national and local level development plans. These findings of Nepal - are relevant to neighbouring countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh and India.
   Key policy insights
   This study finds that locally practiced adaptation strategies have a short term and reactive focus rather than being sustainable and proactive solutions.
   Farmers are confronting weak institutions and financial and managerial difficulties in coping with climate change and adapting to its impacts; hence, local-level adaptation strategies alone cannot cope with the harsh impacts of climate change.
   The research findings indicate the urgency and need to integrate or mainstream local adaptation strategies into national and local level development planning to strengthen adaptation practice and make it sustainable.

AB  - Salt-affected soils are a global challenge, affecting 1 billion ha of land, with 200 million ha found in Africa. The challenge brings adverse impacts on agricultural productivity, food security, environmental sustainability, and food security. In Tanzania, more than 2 million ha of land are salt-affected, of which 1.7 million ha are saline soil and 0.3 million ha are sodic soil. To cope with this threat, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its extent (coverage), existing types, and available management strategies. This review presents a comprehensive account of the challenges and opportunities of salt-affected soils in Tanzania and examines management options that have been observed to increase agricultural productivity in rice-growing areas. A systematic review of relevant articles published in databases was carried out using PRISMA guidelines and flowcharts. This review highlights the origin, extent, types, and various techniques for alleviating salt-affected soil problems. It also emphasize on the use of inorganic and organic amendments, salt-tolerant varieties, irrigation water quality, and drainage infrastructure. We revealed that farmers, use burned and unburned rice husks, sawdust, gypsum, and farm yard manure (FYM) as copping mechanisms. Furthermore, there have been continuing efforts to develop salt-tolerant rice varieties, coupled with maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and site-specific soil management options, as appropriate solutions to tackle salt issues. Given the light of existing data, the review recommends using RS and GIS for updating information on salt-affected soils, particularly in irrigated areas, as an essential component of sustainable management and preventing further loss of agricultural land.

AB  - Recreational spearfishing is a fishing method that occurs globally, yet receives considerably less attention in the scientific literature relative to other recreational fishing methods, such as angling. Lack of scientific information on spearfishing may negatively affect the development and management of marine recreational fisheries. We conducted a systematic review of 102 peer-reviewed papers published between 1967 and 2022 pertaining to marine recreational spearfishing. Based on this literature review, we provide an overview of key insights across social, economic, and ecological dimensions of marine recreational spearfishing. While spearfishers represent less than 5% of marine recreational fishers, the participants are younger and may differ from recreational anglers in their motivations, with suggestions of increased well-being generated from a close connection with the sea during underwater fishing. Recreational spearfishers mostly target species of moderate to high levels of vulnerability that are mid to high trophic level carnivores. Though spearfishers can deliberately target larger individuals of exploited populations, this is not a generalizable pattern. Despite a growing body of research on the ecological impacts of marine recreational spearfishing, there is limited knowledge of these effects and their mechanisms across biological levels of organization (e.g., individual, population, community and ecosystem) compared with those of other fishing methods. Recreational spearfishers can contribute to advances in marine ecological knowledge, and inclusive participatory management could represent a key step towards transformative sustainable development of marine recreational spearfishing. Throughout the review, we identify gaps in the research and areas where future research is needed to better inform the socio-economic importance, ecosystem impacts and future management of marine recreational spearfishing.

AB  - In the current era of sustainable energy and countries' efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to green transportation, lithium batteries have emerged as a promising means of meeting transportation requirements. Specifically, their high energy density makes them suitable for use in electric vehicles. These vehicles offer a way to comply with stringent regulations and reduce emissions. A lithium battery's efficacy and lifespan are significantly affected by temperature. In order to prioritize electric vehicle safety and reduce range anxiety, it is crucial to have a comprehensive comprehension of the current state as well as the ability to anticipate future developments and address issues related to battery thermal management systems (BTMS). A Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) that is optimally designed is essential for ensuring that Li-ion batteries operate properly within an ideal and safe temperature range. This system must effectively maintain a uniform temperature distribution across the cell, module, and battery pack's surface. This article begins with a bibliographic overview of research conducted on battery thermal management systems (BTMS). In particular, it emphasizes the significance of using phase change material (PCM)-based hybrid cooling systems. These types of hybrid systems have the potential to save energy without requiring moving elements and vehicle system power consumption. The paper then analyzes lithium-ion battery types, the processes of chemical reaction, the generation of electrical energy, and the mechanisms of heat generation within the battery. In addition, the impact of temperature on thermal phenomena in batteries, including thermal runaway and lithium dendrite, is examined. The study then provides a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the thermal management strategy in recent experimental, simulation, and modeling research within the organized category of BTMS for all-electric and hybrid vehicle battery packs. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each category of active and passive cooling methods, such as air, liquid, phase change material, heat pipe, thermoelectric, and refrigerant, were assessed. Then, research gaps were discussed, and prospective research directions, including passive-active hybrid techniques, were proposed.

AB  - Renewable energy resources such as offshore wind and wave energy are environmentally friendly and omnipresent. A hybrid offshore wind-wave energy system produces a more sustainable form of energy that is not only eco-friendly but also economical and efficient as compared to use of individual resources. The objective of this paper is to give a detailed review of co-generation technologies for hybrid offshore wind and wave energy. The proposed area of this review paper is based on the power conversions techniques, response coupling, control schemes for co-generation and complimentary generation, and colocation and integrated conversion systems. This paper aims to offer a systematic review to cover recent research and development of novel hybrid offshore wind-wave energy (HOWWE) systems. The current hybrid wind-wave energy structures lack efficiency due to their design and AC-DC-AC power conversion that need to be improved by applying an advanced control strategy. Thus, using different power conversion techniques and control system methodologies, the HOWWE structure can be improved and will be transferrable to the other hybrid models such as hybrid solar and wind energy. The state-of-the-art HOWWE systems are reviewed. Critical analysis of each method is performed to evaluate the best possible combination for development of a HOWWE system.

AB  - Extensive research has been conducted promoting empowerment, inclusive decision making, and self-determination by employees. However, where does an organization initiate change if employees stay in their comfort zone and rather have a work-to-rule mentality? They just do not take over responsibility and the power they are given. The inductive case study involved first-hand data about leader-member exchange and corporate culture. A qualitative research approach was selected by employing personal construct psychology to receive an unbiased cultural view of employees and leaders interacting. A sample of 61 repertory grid structured interviews with 21 leaders and 40 employees produced 782 unique personal assessment criteria. The applied methodology allows a quantitative analysis of these assessments in association with leadership, error management, and employees' proactive behavior. This unusual psychological-based approach chosen as intuitive interviews predicated on personal construct psychology is unlikely to provoke socially desirable or questionnaire-driven results. Based on the case study findings, a systematic review of contemporary scientific literature was conducted to generate broadly applicable results. The final qualitative synthesis included 41 research articles relevant to the investigated topic. Theoretical and empirical results allowed concluding that leadership vulnerability supports error management and employees' psychological safety. These combinations are prerequisites to proactive behavior. Additional preconditions to proactivity are employee resilience and organizational commitment. This article's results could give practical recommendations in case organizations lack the proactive behavior of their workforce. Finally, this article advocates further research on vulnerability in leadership and managers communicating their own weaknesses and mistakes as it is an underrepresented area in current scientific literature.

AB  - Background: Regenerative medicine is a medical subspecialty that seeks to recruit and enhance the body's own inherent healing armamentarium in the treatment of patient pathology. This therapy's intention is to assist in the repair, and to potentially replace or restore damaged tissue through the use of autologous or allogenic biologics. This field is rising like a Phoenix from the ashes of underperforming conventional therapy midst the hopes and high expectations of patients and medical personnel alike. But, because this is a relatively new area of medicine that has yet to substantiate its outcomes, care must be taken in its public presentation and promises as well as in its use.
   Objective: To provide guidance for the responsible, safe, and effective use of biologic therapy in the lumbar spine. To present a template on which to build standardized therapies using biologics. To ground potential administrators of biologics in the knowledge of the current outcome statistics and to stimulate those interested in providing biologic therapy to participate in high quality research that will ultimately promote and further advance this area of medicine.
   Methods: The methodology used has included the development of objectives and key questions. A panel of experts from various medical specialties and subspecialties as well as differing regions collaborated in the formation of these guidelines and submitted (if any) their appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest. Trustworthy standards were employed in the creation of these guidelines. The literature pertaining to regenerative medicine, its effectiveness, and adverse consequences was thoroughly reviewed using a best evidence synthesis of the available literature. The grading for recommendation was provided as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
   Summary of Evidence:
   Lumbar Disc Injections:
   Based on the available evidence regarding the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), including one high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT), multiple moderate-quality observational studies, a single-arm meta-analysis and evidence from a systematic review, the qualitative evidence has been assessed as Level Ill (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best-evidence synthesis.
   Based on the available evidence regarding the use of medicinal signaling/ mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) with a high-quality RCT, multiple moderate-quality observational studies, a single-arm meta-analysis, and 2 systematic reviews, the qualitative evidence has been assessed as Level Ill (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best evidence synthesis.
   Lumbar Epidural Injections
   Based on one high-quality RCT, multiple relevant moderate-quality observational studies and a single-arm meta-analysis, the qualitative evidence has been assessed as Level IV (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best evidence synthesis.
   Lumbar Facet Joint Injections
   Based on one high-quality RCT and 2 moderate-quality observational studies, the qualitative evidence for facet joint injections with PRP has been assessed as Level IV (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best evidence synthesis.
   Sacroiliac Joint Injection
   Based on one high-quality RCT, one moderate-quality observational study, and one low-quality case report, the qualitative evidence has been assessed as Level IV (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best evidence synthesis.
   Conclusion: Based on the evidence synthesis summarized above, there is Level III evidence for intradiscal injections of PRP and MSCs, whereas the evidence is considered Level IV for lumbar facet joint, lumbar epidural, and sacroiliac joint injections of PRP, (on a scale of Level I through V) using a qualitative modified approach to the grading of evidence based on best evidence synthesis.
   Regenerative therapy should be provided to patients following diagnostic evidence of a need for biologic therapy, following a thorough discussion of the patient's needs and expectations, after properly educating the patient on the use and administration of biologics and in full light of the patient's medical history. Regenerative therapy may be provided independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatment including a structured exercise program, physical therapy, behavioral therapy, and along with the appropriate conventional medical therapy as necessary. Appropriate precautions should be taken into consideration and followed prior to performing biologic therapy. Multiple guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), potential limitations in the use of biologic therapy and the appropriate requirements for compliance with the FDA have been detailed in these guidelines.

AB  - Flower strips have become a prevalent measure in agricultural landscapes to counteract biodiversity loss and especially promote pollinators. Although their benefits for pollinating insects have been frequently evaluated and reported, generalized conclusions about optimal settings for effective flower strips are still difficult. From the perspective of pollinators, flower strips vary distinctly in habitat quality, and the same applies for the control sites selected for scientific studies. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach based on a systematic review of recent studies (2009-2020) to analyze the relationship between flower strip effectiveness for pollinators and the contrast in habitat quality between flower strips and control sites. We extracted 350 data entries from 29 of 172 studies based on available data for richness or abundance of the pollinator taxa groups Apiformes, Lepidoptera and Syrphidae as response variables, for both flower strips and control treatments. All flower strips and control treatments were assigned a habitat quality score including information on spatial dimension, floral resources and management. Moreover, we included information on landscape complexity as measured by percent cover of seminatural habitats in the studied landscape. In general, our results of meta-analytical models showed an increasing effect size of flower strips on pollinators for higher contrasts in habitat quality between flower strips and control treatments. This relationship was consistent across pollinator taxa and different levels of landscape complexity. Altogether, in terms of pollinator habitat quality, high-quality flower strips were more attractive than low-quality flower strips, and the reported effectiveness of flower strips decreased from low-quality to high-quality control treatments. We recommend that results of future studies evaluating flower strips for pollinators are always linked with the contrast in habitat quality between selected flower strips and control treatments.

AB  - Purpose The social aspects of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems are underpinning their sustainability and effectiveness. The assessment of these systems from a life cycle perspective is widespread throughout environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), but few studies have used social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). The present study is an innovative review with the objective to analyse and describe the current level of development of S-LCA applications in MSWM, and to identify the main methodological challenges and best practices, aiming at recommending approaches to harmonise future S-LCA applications in MSWM. Materials and methods A systematic review of the literature found 36 relevant scientific articles. These were submitted to bibliometric and content analysis, which includes an analysis of how methodological aspects of the four phases of S-LCA were applied in comparison with best practice and existing guidelines. Results and discussion There was a predominance of case studies in developing countries (59%) and evaluation of the stages of collection/transportation, pre-processing (sorting) and landfilling (55%). There were more studies focusing on stakeholders, "workers" and "local communities" and in the impact subcategories "employment", "working hours", "health and safety/working conditions", "community involvement/participation" and "health and safety/living conditions of community". There was great variability in the application of the method (47% of the studies included methodological developments). However, the 39% based on UNEP guidelines were closer to a methodological consensus. Conclusion In general, studies need more detail and clarity in describing the methodological decisions used. Improvements are needed for issues that limit the S-LCA method, including the difficulties of covering the entire life cycle, relating impacts to the functional unit, standardizing impact assessment methods, addressing allocation and data quality issues and interpretation of results and their limitations. Improvements can be achieved by using participatory methods in the selection of categories, subcategories and impact indicators, as well as by clarifying the definition of a product system and detailing "cut-off criteria" of processes/organizations and the impact of these decisions on results.

AB  - Background: Built environments have shown to be associated with health, with physical activity (PA) considered one of the critical pathways for achieving benefits. Navigating available evidence on the built environment and PA is challenging given the number of reviews.
   Objective: Examine the current state and quality of research looking at associations between built environments and total PA and domains of PA (i.e., leisure/recreation, transportation, school) among children and youth (1-18 years).
   Methods: We systematically searched the grey literature and six bibliographic databases from January 2000 to May 2020. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR2. Results by age group were synthesized using narrative syntheses and harvest plots, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE approach.
   Results: This overview included 65 reviews. Most reviews were of very low-to-low quality. High certainty was found for positive associations between transportation PA and walking/cycling/active transportation (AT) infrastructure. There was high certainty for positive associations between streets/play streets and total PA, alongside lower certainty for transportation and leisure PA. Very low-to-moderate certainty supports schoolyards designed to promote PA were positively associated with total PA, but mixed for school PA (except children). Less consistent positive associations were found for forests/trees, greenspace/open space, recreation facilities, street lighting, traffic safety, population/residential density, proximity/access to destinations, neighbourhood characteristics, and home environments. There is very low-to-moderate certainty for negative associations between greater distance to school and traffic volume and domains of PA. Generally, null or mixed associations were observed for aesthetics, parks, AT comfort infrastructure, land-use mix, street connectivity, urban/rural status, and public transit.
   Discussion: There remains a need for high quality systematic reviews and studies to evaluate the effects of environmental changes across the pediatric age spectrum and using a PA domain approach. Given the global physical inactivity crisis the built environment remains and important means to promote PA among children/youth.

AB  - Immigrants make up a significant population in many countries; in some countries as many as 30% of the population was born overseas. An increasing number of studies have found that immigrants are likely to travel differently to their native-born counterparts. But to date the reasons for these differences have been explored disparately across many different countries and contexts, which makes it difficult to determine whether these findings are transferrable. This study aims to develop a conceptual framework of immigrant travel behaviour using a systematic literature review of existing studies. A systematic search uncovered 48 studies of immigrant travel behaviour between 2004 and 2022; nearly half of these studies were published in the last five years. Most studies found that on average, immigrants drove less and used other modes (including carpool) more than native-born counterparts, but that travel behaviour tends to assimilate toward the norm over time. We propose two broad factors that influence this process: direct effects including demographics, attitudes, past travel behaviour and socio-cultural norms; and the role of ethnic enclaves which set the scene for the transport and land-use system experienced by immigrant communities. But all of these factors play out differently against the intersecting background of an immigrants' country of origin and country of destination. Given this complexity, future research should explore a greater variety of immigrant cohorts and look in greater depth at the past travel experiences of immigrants. If we choose not to consider where people come from, we risk further excluding potentially vulnerable groups as well as potentially missing out on a growing market for more sustainable transport solutions.

AB  - Smart management of urban space is an important way to achieve the goal of sustainable urban development. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in urban space management work and have greatly improved the level of it. UAV technology assisting urban space management involves many technical details and has generated a number of problems. Therefore, a systematic review of the applications of UAVs in urban spatial management work is very necessary and can provide a comprehensive reference for relevant researchers. This is conducive to the generation of more new insights, methods, and applications. However, according to our research, there is a lack of relevant systematic investigation. We screened and researched a large number of relevant literature works (about 230) with the help of search tools, such as Web of Science and IEEE Xplore, and combined with our own working experience to review and summarize the field in an all-round way. Taking the definition, needs, and challenges of urban spatial management as an entry point, this article systematically summarizes the task flow, working paradigm, technical system, and application direction of UAV-assisted urban spatial management. It also takes our recently developed UAV urban management system as an example to provide an introduction on how to integrate advanced technologies such as UAV and artificial intelligence. Finally, this article summarizes several concluding findings and proposes several future research directions. The research in this article shows that UAV technology has already played a great role in urban spatial management work, but it is still far from realizing automation and intelligence, and it needs to continue to make efforts in terms of methods, systems, applications, and policies. In order to achieve these goals, UAV technology can be further integrated with advanced technologies such as deep learning, more types of UAV industry applications can be carried out, a more functional unmanned aircraft system can be developed, and better management policies can be formulated.

AB  - The development of optimized and efficient alternative energy systems that comply with regulatory requirements is a challenge the world needs to embrace. This study provides a systematic review of thermal processing methods to convert lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks, particularly municipal solid wastes, to biofuels. The vast majority of contemporary biorefineries employ combustion systems for energy recovery and to facilitate downstream processing. Following a detailed assessment of existing technologies to develop biorefineries, an innovative system that couples thermal, biochemical and fuel cell technologies to recover useful products and electricity is proposed. The present study targets two key objectives: (1) introducing the fundamental knowledge to understand the concept of thermal technologies for waste processing, and (2) reviewing different types of existing biorefineries and comparing the thermal processing strategies. This study also introduces the concept of the biorefinery landfill a biorefinery located within a waste disposal site which represents a sustainable and efficient approach to develop waste resources. This concept could help to drastically reduce the cost of conventional power plants by lowering logistical and supply chain costs related to waste transportation and lowering operating and capital costs by using existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the thermal processing of waste within a landfill aids volume reduction, which will increase the life expectancy of the site and offers the opportunity for energy recovery. The processing options and analysis presented in this study can contribute to initiatives for the development of sustainable bio-power systems and helps to lay the foundation for comprehensive analysis of waste resource use optimization.

AB  - Individuals and communities socially construct risk, and societies with greater risk perception may be more apt to mobilize or adapt to emergent threats like climate change. Increasing climate change awareness is often considered necessary in the first stages of the adaptation process to manage its impacts and reduce overall vulnerability. Since agriculture is affected by climate change in several ways, farmers can provide first-hand observations of climate change impacts and adaptation options. This paper aims to identify the current research trends and set the future research agenda on climate change awareness, perceived impacts, and adaptive capacity from farmers' experiences and behavior. We analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020 using bibliometrics. From the original portfolio, we select 108 articles for a more comprehensive and systematic review. Publication trends and content analysis have been employed to identify influential work, delineate the mental structure of farmers' beliefs and concerns, and identify main research gaps. The comprehensive analysis reported (1) farmers' socio-demographic characteristics influencing farmers' perceptions; (2) awareness and changing climate evidence due to human activity; (3) the main perceived effects (rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and extreme events); (4) the most relevant adaptation measures (crop changing and soil/water conservation techniques); and (5) factors and barriers limiting adaptation (lack of information, credit, and expertness). The review outlines the main gaps and their drivers to help future researchers, managers, and decision-makers to prioritize their actions according to farmers' concerns and their adaptive capacity to reduce farming vulnerability.

AB  - Over the last decade, there have been increasing calls for robust impact evaluations of voluntary agricultural sustainability standards (VSS?s). In response, this study reviews the literature regarding 13 major agricultural standards, asking: where are certified crops being studied? Which sustainability outcomes and indicators are measured? And finally, what does the current evidence base suggest about VSS outcomes? The analysis of 45 peer-reviewed articles suggests a mismatch between what is certified and what is studied. Some crops and standards are over-represented in the literature as compared to their amount of certified production (e.g. coffee and Fairtrade certification), while others are under-represented (cotton, sugar, cocoa, soy, and palm oil, in addition to Organic certification). The review also identifies countries which appear to be under-represented in the literature, including Brazil, Australia, Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, and the United States. When measuring success, economic indicators are the most frequently evaluated, and only 20% of studies analyze economic, social, and environmental indicators simultaneously. When grouped by case, the indicator results tend to be positive on average (51%), followed by no difference (41%) and negative (8%) outcomes. There are no significant differences among sustainability pillars in terms of the average proportion of positive and negative results. These findings should be interpreted carefully, since the evidence base is heavily weighted towards coffee certification (75% of cases analyzed), and impacts are highly context dependent. Finally, the review identifies best practices in conducting robust evaluations, including the importance of addressing sustainability trade-offs and appropriately measuring environmental outcomes. While significant gaps remain, the findings indicate an increase in research credibly measuring VSS impacts.

AB  - Urban climate change adaptation efforts have often been criticized for exacerbating the inequitable impacts of climate change by failing to address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of adaptation. There is an urgent need to incorporate equity and justice concerns in adaptation planning as well as approaches and tools that enable such integration. However, climate justice scholarship to date has largely focused on theoretical questions and there is still a lack of focus on the operational aspects for supporting the implementation of climate justice. In this article, we argue that existing tools already in use in planning practice have the potential to support this aim. In particular, we argue that the integration of socio-economic data into adaptation planning practice could be an avenue for justice-centered urban adaptation. While the potential is clear, how to do this is still underexplored. To shed light on this question, we conduct a systematic review of research on the use of socio-economic projections in urban climate change adaptation planning and decision-making to investigate how these could be used as a tool to ensure just urban adaptation. Grounded in a recognized conceptual framework on urban climate justice, we analyze the evolution of research on socio-economic projections in urban adaptation and evaluate the potential for existing applications to promote climate justice. Through this analysis, we find that while socio-economic projections have not been explicitly linked to justice outcomes in the existing literature, clear potentials exist for these to be used as a tool to promote distributive, procedural, and recognition and restorative justice. Finally, we propose an operational framework for the application of socio-economic projections to promote justice-centered urban adaptation. Applying such a framework to urban adaptation planning can help center justice concerns in larger strategic adaptation planning efforts and enable a new form of more inclusive, data-driven climate governance in cities based on current know-how and existing capacities.

AB  - In the twenty-first century, nanotechnology has emerged as a potentially game-changing innovation. Essential minerals are mostly unavailable in modern cropping systems without the application of synthetic fertilizers, which have a serious negative impact on the ecosystem. This review focuses on the coupling of nanoparticles with biofertilizers to function as nano-biofertilizers (NBFs), which may ensure world food security in the face of the rising population. The inoculation of plants with NBFs improves plant development and resistance to stress. Metallic nanoparticles as well as organic components comprising polysaccharide and chitosan may be encapsulated, utilizing microbe-based green synthesis to make NBFs, which circumvents the limitations of conventional chemical fertilizers. The application of NBFs is just getting started, and shows more promise than other approaches for changing conventional farming into high-tech "smart" farming. This study used bibliographic analysis using Web of Science to find relevant papers on "nano biofertilizers", "plants", and "agriculture". These subjects have received a lot of attention in the literature, as shown by the co-citation patterns of these publications. The novel use of nanotechnology in agriculture is explored in this research work, which makes use of the unique characteristics of nanoscale materials to address urgent concerns including nutrient delivery, crop protection, and sustainable farming methods. This study attempts to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge by discussing the formulation, fabrication, and characterization of NBFs, as well as elucidating the mechanisms by which NBFs interact with plants and how this benefits the ability of the plant to withstand biotic and abiotic stress brought about by climate change. This review also addresses recent developments and future directions in farming using NBF formulations in the field.

AB  - Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations. (5) And scholarship in permaculture has always been a diverse marginal sector, but is growing.

AB  - Background
   There is renewed interest in effective measures to control Zika and dengue vectors. A synthesis of published literature with a focus on the quality of evidence is warranted to determine the effectiveness of vector control strategies.
   Methodology
   We conducted a meta-review assessing the effectiveness of any Aedes control measure. We searched Scopus and Medline for relevant reviews through to May 2016. Titles, abstracts and full texts were assessed independently for inclusion by two authors. Data extraction was performed in duplicate and validity of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.
   Findings
   13 systematic reviews that investigated the effect of control measures on entomological parameters or disease incidence were included. Biological controls seem to achieve better reduction of entomological indices than chemical controls, while educational campaigns can reduce breeding habitats. Integrated vector control strategies may not always increase effectiveness. The efficacy of any control programme is dependent on local settings, intervention type, resources and study duration, which may partly explain the varying degree of success between studies. Nevertheless, the quality of evidence was mostly low to very low due to poor reporting of study design, observational methodologies, heterogeneity, and indirect outcomes, thus hindering an evidence-based recommendation.
   Conclusions
   The evidence for the effectiveness of Aedes control measures is mixed. Chemical control, which is commonly used, does not appear to be associated with sustainable reductions of mosquito populations over time. Indeed, by contributing to a false sense of security, chemical control may reduce the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at encouraging local people to remove mosquito breeding sites. Better quality studies of the impact of vector control interventions on the incidence of human infections with Dengue or Zika are still needed.

AB  - Background The agricultural and construction sectors demand enormous amounts of natural resources and generate environmental impacts that negatively affect ecosystems. One of the main problems is the generation and inadequate management of waste. For this reason, under the approaches of the new sustainable and circular models, waste valorization has been prioritised as a strategy for advancing towards the sustainability of production systems. This research aims to carry out a general analysis of Agricultural Waste Biomass (AWB) in the production of bio-based products for the construction sector. Bibliometric techniques were applied for the general analysis of the scientific production obtained from Scopus. A systematic review identified the main research approaches. In addition, European projects were reviewed to assess the practical application. This study is novel and provides relevant contributions to new trends in the valorisation of AWB in the building sector and the sustainability benefits. For policymakers, it is a source of information on the contribution of new policies to scientific advances and the aspects that need to be strengthened to improve sustainable and circular practices in both sectors. Results The results show that 74% of the research has been published within the last 5 years. Regarding the main types of AWBs, rice husk ash and sugar cane bagasse ash are the most commonly used in manufacturing a wide variety of bio-based building products. Cement, concrete and bricks are the main bio-based products obtained from AWB. However, a new approach to utilisation was identified in road construction. Conclusions The findings indicate that the AWB is an important resource with great potential for the construction sector. Similarly, that policies on sustainable and circular development have driven scientific progress on new alternatives for the valorisation of AWB to improve sustainability in the construction sector. Although the practical application has also been driven through European projects, development at this level is still low. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen partnerships between these two sectors and improve government strategies on sustainability and circularity to overcome existing constraints.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo explore client and provider experiences and related health outcomes of sexual and reproductive health interventions that have been led by or that have involved mining companies.
   BackgroundMiners, and those living in communities surrounding mines in developing countries, are a vulnerable population with a high sexual and reproductive health burden. People in these communities require specific healthcare services although the exact delivery needs are unclear. There are no systematic reviews of evidence to guide delivery of sexual and reproductive health interventions to best address the needs of men and women in mining communities.
   DesignA narrative synthesis.
   MethodsA search of peer-reviewed literature from 2000-2012 was undertaken with retrieved documents assessed using an inclusion/exclusion criterion and quality appraisal guided by critical assessment tools. Concepts were analysed thematically.
   ResultsA desire for HIV testing and treatment was associated with the recognition of personal vulnerability, but this was affected by fear of stigma. Regular on-site services facilitated access to voluntary counselling and testing and HIV care, but concerns for confidentiality were a serious barrier. The provision of HIV and sexually transmitted infection clinical and promotive services revealed mixed health outcomes. Recommended service improvements included rapid HIV testing, the integration of sexual and reproductive health into regular health services also available to family members and culturally competent, ethical, providers who are better supported to involve consumers in health promotion.
   ConclusionThere is a need for research to better inform health interventions so that they build on local cultural norms and values and address social needs. A holistic approach to sexual and reproductive health beyond a focus on HIV may better engage community members, mining companies and governments in healthcare delivery.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses may require appropriate workplace support and incentives to deliver sexual and reproductive health interventions in developing mining contexts where task shifting exists.

AB  - Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a multifaceted problem comprising political, socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental aspects. Due to exponential urban growth, it has become one of the most significant issues faced by urban spaces in developing countries. The gap in environmental knowledge among the youth and the old within developing countries contribute to ecological issues or waste management problems, resulting in unsustainable development, with important consequences in low-income countries. For that matter, a systematic review was conducted aiming to identify and analyse environmental knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and practice studies on SWM from 2010 to 2019 in developing countries. The evidence suggests that students at both secondary and tertiary levels have positive environmental attitudes, and high awareness of environmental issues, but there is a lack of practical education of teachers to guide students to put SWM into practice. Student's low environmental knowledge is related to a deficiency in teachers' practical experience in SWM for environmental sustainability. A relationship between teachers' and students' knowledge and attitudes towards SWM, as well as differences in awareness, attitude, and practices of SWM linked with education and age, were also found. This review also revealed that the lack of environmental education in most developing countries is caused by fragilities in practical environmental curricula of teachers to respond to modern-day environmental issues for sustainable development and cleaner production (CP). To bridge the knowledge gap between the youth and older people in SWM, environmental sustainability education should be integrated into schools at all levels within developing countries.

AB  - Despite several decades of research on the effects of fragmentation and habitat change on biodiversity, there remain strong biases in the geographical regions and taxonomic species studied. The knowledge gaps resulting from these biases are of particular concern if the forests most threatened with modification are also those for which the effects of such change are most poorly understood. To quantify the nature and magnitude of such biases, we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on forest fragmentation in the tropics for the period 1980-2012. Studies included focused on any type of response of single species, communities, or assemblages of any taxonomic group to tropical forest fragmentation and on fragmentation-related changes to forests. Of the 853 studies we found in the SCOPUS database, 64% were conducted in the Neotropics, 13% in Asia, 10% in the Afrotropics, and 5% in Australasia. Thus, although the Afrotropics is subject to the highest rates of deforestation globally, it was the most disproportionately poorly studied biome. Significant taxonomic biases were identified. Of the taxonomic groups considered, herpetofauna was the least studied in the tropics, particularly in Africa. Research examining patterns of species distribution was by far the most common type (72%), and work focused on ecological processes (28%) was rare in all biomes, but particularly in the Afrotropics and for fauna. We suggest research efforts be directed toward less-studied biogeographic regions, particularly where the threat of forest fragmentation continues to be high. Increased research investment in the Afrotropics will be important to build knowledge of threats and inform responses in a region where almost no efforts to restore its fragmented landscapes have yet begun and forest protection is arguably most tenuous. Sesgos Biogeograficos y Taxonomicos en la Investigacion de la Fragmentacion de Bosques Tropicales
   Resumen A pesar de varias decadas de investigacion sobre los efectos de la fragmentacion y el cambio de habitat sobre la biodiversidad, aun persisten sesgos fuertes en las regiones geograficas y especies taxonomicas estudiadas. Los vacios en el conocimiento que resultan de estos sesgos son de importancia particular si los bosques con mayor amenaza de modificacion tambien son aquellos para los cuales los efectos de dicho cambio estan entendidos pobremente. Para cuantificar la naturaleza y la magnitud de dichos sesgos llevamos a cabo una revision sistematica de la literatura publicada sobre la fragmentacion de bosques tropicales en el periodo de 1980 a 2012. Los estudios incluyeron aquellos enfocados en cualquier tipo de respuesta de una sola especie, comunidad o conjunto de cualquier grupo taxonomico a la fragmentacion del bosque; y aquellos enfocados en los cambios en los bosques relacionados con la fragmentacion. Los campos biogeograficos tropicales estuvieron sujetos a las tasas mas grandes de perdida de bosque, y el menor numero de estudios publicados fue sobre ellos. De los 853 estudios que encontramos en la base de datos SCOPUS, 64% se llevaron a cabo en la zona neotropical, 13% en Asia, 10% en la zona afrotropical, y 5% en Australasia. Asi, aunque la zona afrotropical esta sujeta a la tasa mas alta de deforestacion a nivel global, fue el bioma con menor estudio. Se identificaron sesgos taxonomicos significativos. De los grupos taxonomicos considerados, la herpetofauna fue la menos estudiada, particularmente en africa. La investigacion encargada de examinar los patrones de distribucion fue por mucho el tipo mas comun (72%) y el trabajo enfocado en los procesos ecologicos (28%) fue raro para todos los biomas, pero particularmente en la zona afrotropical y para la fauna. Sugerimos que los esfuerzos de investigacion sean dirigidos hacia las regiones biogeograficas menos estudiadas, particularmente donde la amenaza de la fragmentacion de bosques sigue siendo alta. La inversion incrementada para la investigacion en los Afrotropicos sera importante para obtener conocimiento de amenazas e informar respuestas en una region donde casi no se han iniciado esfuerzos para restaurar sus terrenos fragmentados y la proteccion de los bosques a lo mucho es poco convincente.

AB  - Brazil is the country in the world with the highest freshwater fish diversity. Because of the high rates of species introduction, the number of publications about invasive fish has increased in the last decades in this country. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify knowledge patterns and gaps related to the introduction of non-native fishes in distinct Brazilian freshwater ecosystems. Compared to the last official report, we found that the number of records in the literature is three times greater, with at least 352 non-native freshwater fish species (255 translocated and 97 exotics). Studies were concentrated in developed and impacted regions of the country and were mostly conducted in reservoirs and rivers. Only 7% of the studies tested invasion hypotheses, mainly those in the so-called Darwin's and trait concept clusters. Studies that assessed the effects of non-native species investigated a few species, such as Oreochromis niloticus, Coptodon rendalli, or Cichla kelberi. However, the impacts of most species, especially those translocated among Brazilian ecoregions, remain largely unexplored. Therefore, the fish invasion literature in Brazil still has relevant knowledge gaps, biases, and research topics needing investigation. This picture prevents a proper understanding of the ecological and socio-economic consequences of fish introductions to native ecosystems, especially in highly biodiverse regions such as the Amazon. Future research and government agendas should fill these knowledge gaps to allow the establishment of effective surveillance, control, and management programs for non-native fishes in Brazilian freshwaters.

AB  - Protected areas are a fundamental mechanism for ensuring the persistence of biodiversity. The strategic policy objectives set by governments for protected area land acquisition are strong determinants of biodiversity outcomes. An examination of these objectives is necessary to determine those most influential in designing protected area networks and understand why Australia's extinction rates exceed those elsewhere despite actively establishing protected areas over the past several decades. To examine spatio-temporal trends in policy objectives for protected areas, we evaluated the strategic priorities in Federal, State, and Territory policy documents across Australia between 1992 and 2019 using thematic analysis. We classified priorities into seven themes: adequacy, Indigenous and cultural values; representation of ecosystem and species types; threatened species and their habitat; social and recreational values; unique values and avoiding threatening processes. We found that the representation of ecosystem and species types was the most prevalent theme in policy documents, and the least common theme was social and recreational values. We posit several reasons for this trend and warn that emphasizing extent, in terms of area or representativeness, may diminish the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact for biodiversity outcomes. We found that policies were generally supportive of the strategic identification of particular species or communities that would quantifiably benefit from protection (referred to as avoided loss). Risked-based approaches to the establishment of protected areas are supported by modern conservation literature to enhance the protected area network's effectiveness. To maximize limited resources, we recommend that governments continue encouraging urgency to avoid species and habitat loss in their strategic priorities. This urgency should be accompanied by clear and consistent funding for on-the-ground actions which facilitate the socio-ecological outcomes that characterize modern protected area policy.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse through a systematic literature review the evolution of the theme of environmental social and governance (ESG) in universities, correlating variables and presenting a panorama for Latin American universities. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a systematic literature review approach. The Web of Science database was used for data collection, and a set of keywords (Environmental, Social and Governance x Universities) and a classification method were used, resulting in 111 articles classified in the Zotero software. After classification, these publications were analysed in the VOSviewer software. Findings The main evidence about ESG and universities shows that its relevance has been growing worldwide with an emphasis on England, the USA, Spain, followed by Brazil in fourth place regarding the number of papers published worldwide. The most representative areas identified were governance, sustainability, higher education, sustainable campus, environmental science, ecology, science and technology. The journals presenting more published papers under the topic are International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, Journal of Cleaner Production and Sustainability. As for the most relevant authors, the Europeans Lozano and Leal Filho, Velasquez from Mexico and Brandli from Brazil were identified. As for institutions, the University Durham, State University System of Florida and State University of Campinas do Brazil stand out. Research limitations/implications As the main limitation of the study is related to the sample of articles. This study is focused on the analysis of publications from the last decade, presenting only 111 results. However, this restriction in the timeline is justified as it is a new topic; this study was also limited to the use of a single database; in this sense, future research can carry out a more comprehensive review of the sustainability literature covering periods prior to a decade and an analysis in other databases. Originality/value These results provide a basis for improving sustainability in universities and ESG in Latin America. It also allows to explore and reflect on several indicators, enabling the evaluation and planning of actions to improve competitiveness.

AB  - The health sector is one of the keys to sustainable development. Although it is directly related to only one Sustainable Development Goal (Goal 3, "Ensuring a healthy life and promoting well-being at all ages"), the sector itself, which aims to protect health, is paradoxically at the same time the main emitter of environmental pollutants that have a negative impact on health itself. Therefore, sustainability has become a key priority for health sector organizations, and leadership in this area is essential at all levels. Scientific research plays a particular role here, helping to more clearly define the links between environmental sustainability and the health effects of a polluted environment and climate change as well as indicating the direction of actions needed and disseminating good practices that can help accelerate the adoption of efforts towards climate neutrality and sustainable development of health sector organizations. The aim of this article is to present the current state of the art and future research scenarios in the field of green and sustainable healthcare through a literature review by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method to perform a bibliometric analysis of papers published in 2012-2022. The Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database is used for this purpose. A total of 144 papers are included for analysis, categorized based on eight fields: author(s), title, year of publication, country, journal, scientific category, and number of citations. Based on the results, themes for future research on green leadership in the healthcare sector are identified and recommended.

AB  - Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an innovative part of the continuously improving HR management has become a common practice for socially and environmentally friendly business organisations in 21st century. CSR is a corporate-level contribution to sustainable development, but also a tool for social responsibility, prestige building, improvement of stakeholders' satisfaction and loyalty, thereby increasing the value of the company. Over the past decades, it has been a key factor to show how the company's activities have an impact on environment, and what kind of social problems it can contribute to by charity actions. Internal CSR activities are also known to increase efficiency, but the intensity of their use is related to the labour market situation. Significant wage differences, increasing labour demand, free labour flow have intensified labour competition, resulting significant fluctuation in several sectors in CEE region. Therefore, these new challenges put pressure on companies to engage in CSR and focus on their human resources. The main purpose of this study is to draw attention to the potential role of internal CSR in reduction of labour shortages. The research is based on systematic review of relevant scientific literature, content analysis of multinational companies' good practices and descriptive analysis of statistical data collected from Eurostat Database (2019) and the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (2019). Through main findings Authors indicate that ethical leadership behaviour, moral recognition of employees, and empathy towards people with personal or health problems still offer new opportunities for solving labour problems. A more efficient use of internal CSR requires a change of attitude and a new leadership style for both large companies and SME sector.

AB  - Lay abstract
   Breast cancer incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing across the globe, especially in countries with poor screening interventions, culminating in delayed diagnosis and greater mortality. Furthermore, for the adequate treatment of breast cancer, treatment plans must be individualized. In this context, the present study was devised to add to the existing pool of information with regard to breast cancer. In addition, the authors wanted to see whether YAP1 (the gene of interest) significantly contributes to breast cancer progression and its spread to distant areas of the body. Also, the authors aimed to study the effect of this gene on survival in breast cancer patients. Knowing the role of YAP1 in breast cancer, it is imperative to make use of this gene in devising treatment strategies for the proper management of breast cancer patients.
   YAP1 plays a key role as a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway. Based on conflicting reports regarding YAP1 function in cancer, this study discerned its role in breast carcinogenesis. First, a systematic review of salient breast cancer studies targeting YAP1 dysregulation was performed. Additionally, freshly excised tumor specimens of approximately 200 breast cancer patients were processed for quantification of YAP1 expression at mRNA and protein levels using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. YAP1 expression was nine folds higher in tumors versus controls and significantly associated with metastasis (p < 0.05) and poor survival in Pakistani breast cancer patients. These findings establish the role of YAP1 overexpression in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Hence, YAP1 inhibition may be considered a possible therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Aim:
   To identify the psychological interventions for which there is consistent, high quality evidence of efficacy in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Method:
   A computer-aided search and manual screening of identified papers was conducted. Randomised controlled trials published in English in peer-reviewed journals, assessing the use of psychological interventions in adult patients with RA were included.
   Results:
   Thirty-four papers published between 1981 and 2009 encompassing 31 studies with 2021 patients were included. There is consistent supportive evidence for the efficacy of disclosure therapy (four studies) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with maintenance therapy (five studies). There is supportive evidence for improvement with CBT of greater than 6 weeks duration (six studies) in the short-term but conflicting evidence for its long-term efficacy. There is some evidence for improvement with biofeedback-based interventions (two studies). There is conflicting evidence for the benefits of counselling (three studies), psychotherapy (two studies) mindfulness and meditation (two studies), and CBT of less than 6 weeks duration (six studies). There is limited evidence regarding relaxation therapy (two studies). Methodological limitations of the reviewed literature included failure of allocation concealment, blinding and conduction of intention-to-treat analysis, as well as the heterogeneity and choice of outcome measures.
   Conclusions:
   This review shows consistent supportive evidence for the use of disclosure therapy, and CBT with maintenance therapy as adjunct therapies in patients with RA. It also highlights methodological limitations in the current literature and the need for future research in this area.

AB  - Background: For hospitals, learning from disaster response efforts and adapting organizational practices can improve resilience in dealing with future disruptions. However, amidst global disruptions by climate change, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and other disasters, hospitals' ability to cope continues to be highly variable. Hence, there are increasing calls to improve hospitals' capabilities to grow and adapt towards enhanced resilience. Aim: This study aims two-fold: (1) to characterize the current state of knowledge about how hospitals are gaining knowledge from their responses to disasters, and (2) to explore how this knowledge can be applied to inform organizational practices for hospital resilience. Method: This study used Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for data collection and framework for data analysis, Covidence software, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords relevant to "hospitals," "learn," "disaster response," and "resilience." The quality appraisal used an adapted version of the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT). Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality appraisal, out of the 420 articles retrieved, 22 articles remained for thematic and content analysis. The thematic analysis included the hospital's functional (operational) and physical (structural and non-structural) sections. The content analysis followed nine learning areas (Governance and Leadership, Planning and Risk Assessment, Surveillance and Monitoring, Communication and Network Engagement, Staff Practices and Safety, Equipment and Resources, Facilities and Infrastructure, Novelty and Innovation, and Learning and Evaluation). On applying the Deming cycle, only four studies described a completed learning cycle wherein hospitals adapted their organizational structures using the prior experience and evaluation gained in responding to disaster(s). Conclusions: There is a gap between hospitals' organizational learning and institutionalized practice. The conceptualized Hybrid Resilience Learning Framework (HRLF) aims to guide the hospitals' decision makers in evaluating organizational resilience and knowledge. In the face of disasters, both the stressful factors and the coping strategies that affect the health care workers (HCWs) should be substantially considered.

AB  - The ever-increasing demand of food and feed along with enormous amounts of losses, wastes, and discards from agricultural and food supply chain have caused numerous socioeconomic and sustainability challenges. Many of these agro-industrial by-products and food wastes have low nutritional and economic value. Examples of these types of feedstocks include biofuel co-products (e.g. distiller grains, sugarcane bagasse), agro-industrial pro-cessing wastes (e.g. oil seed meal, soybean hulls, sugar beet pulp), crop residues (e.g. wheat straw, corn stover) and fruit and vegetables discards. Using feed grade fungi, yeast, bacteria, and enzymes to process (bioprocess) low-valued feedstocks improves protein quality, degrades lignin and improves utilization of dietary fiber for energy, improves phosphorous digestibility, and reduces anti-nutritional factors (e.g., mycotoxins) to perma-nently change the composition of the feedstocks and improve their feeding value for livestock, and therefore, achieving a sustainable food supply system with reduced carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus footprint. The pur-pose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the challenges and potential use of current agro-industrial and food wastes as animal feed ingredients using bioprocessing to improve their feeding value. Highlights from three case studies on bioprocessing of corn-distiller grains, oil seed meals, crop/wood residues with fruit and vegetable discards will be discussed relative to changes in feeding value and contributions toward achieving a more circular and sustainable food supply chain.

AB  - Purpose - Despite the availability of several published reviews on the adoption of blockchain (BC) in supply chain (SC), at present, the literature lacks a comprehensive review incorporating the antecedents and consequences of BC adoption. Moreover, the complex adoption of BC in SC, explained with the mediating and moderating relationships, is not fully consolidated. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) on BC technology adoption (BCTA) in SC by integrating its antecedents and consequences.Design/methodology/approach - Keyword searches were performed in multiple databases resulting 382 articles for evaluation and verification. After careful screening with respect to the purpose of the study and systematic processing of the retrieved articles, a total of 211 peer-reviewed articles were included in this study for review.Findings - Various technological, organisational, individual, social, environmental, operational and economic factors were found as the antecedents of BCTA in SC. In addition, numerous applications of BC Technology (BCT) were identified, including asset management, identity management, transaction management, data management and operations management. Finally, the consequences of BCTA were categorised as operational, risk management, economic and sustainability outcomes.Practical implications - This study can assist relevant decision-makers in managing the factors influencing BCTA and the potential uses of the technology to enhance SC performance.Originality/value - By integrating the antecedents, applications and consequences of BCTA in SC, including the mediators and moderators, an integrated framework was developed that can potentially assist researchers to develop theoretical models. Further, the results of this SLR provide future directions for studying BCTA in supply chain management (SCM).

AB  - Sustainable urban development relies on forward-looking infrastructure development. As an emerging infrastructure system that incorporates green technologies, the Metro-based Underground Logistics System (M-ULS) enables sustainable transportation of passengers and freight within cities collaboratively by sharing rail transit network facilities. M-ULS can effectively save non-renewable energy and reduce pollution to the ecological environment, and the comprehensive benefits of the system make an outstanding contribution to sustainable urban development. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of M-ULS based on different perspectives and to present the development of the M-ULS network integration concept. By employing bibliometric analysis, the four dimensions of M-ULS related literature are statistically analyzed to discover the knowledge structure and research trends. Through thematic discussions, a development path for developing the concept of M-ULS network integration was established. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows: (i) A comparative analysis shows that the metro system has a high potential for freight use; (ii) Improvements in metro freight technologies are conducive to urban economy, environment, and social sustainability; (iii) Network expansion is an inevitable trend for implementing underground logistics based on the metro; (iv) The interaction among public sectors, metro operators, logistics corporations, and users plays a critical role in promoting the development of M-ULS. (v) It is worth mentioning that the planning of green infrastructure should fully consider its comprehensive contribution to the sustainable development of the city. This study visualizes the current status and hotspots of M-ULS research. It also discloses frontier knowledge and novel insights for the integrated planning and operations management of metro and urban underground freight transportation.

AB  - The Yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax), native to regions of Southeast Asia, was accidentally introduced in Europe, South Korea, and Japan, where is has often become invasive. Due to its potential negative impacts at ecologic, economic and social levels, this hornet was included in the "Union list" of the EU legislation for invasive alien species. This means that measures are urgently needed to prevent further introductions, as well as to early-detect and control spread to avoid new populations. In this study we aim to identify the main reported drivers of distribution, ecological preferences, impacts, and methods for preventing introduction, controlling, and managing this invasive species. The supporting information was obtained from a comprehensive literature search. Then, a literature review was performed to classify the records gathered and to extract the relevant information following an adapted Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses framework. The achieved results show a growing interest of researchers on V. velutina nigrithorax through time due to its quick spread and impacts on new ecosystems. They also revealed that there is much information on the State of invasions, whereas more knowledge is needed regarding the Drivers of those invasions. Biological traits such as life history traits, morphology, and the sting venom properties are some of the most studied topics regarding V. velutina nigrithorax. In the future, research should focus on the topics that lack information, analyse other Response solutions that meet the intended measures by the EU legislation, and use new methodology to study the impacts caused by this invader under new perspectives.

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems have suffered an unprecedented loss of habitat-forming hard corals in recent decades. While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m(2). A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar 'growing pains' as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management. Finally, while it is clear that practitioners have developed effective methods to successfully grow corals at small scales, it is critical not to view restoration as a replacement for meaningful action on climate change.

AB  - Best-published evidence supports the combined use of vaccines with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), to reduce the relative risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19; this will enable a safe transition to achieving herd immunity. Albeit complex, the strategic public health goal is to bundle NPIs to keep the basic reproduction number R-0 below one. However, validation of these Nils is conducted using random clinical trials, which is challenging in a swiftly moving pandemic given the need for recruiting large participant cohort over a longitudinal analysis period. This review highlights emerging innovations for potentially improving the design, functionality and improved waste management of disposable face masks such as filtering facepiece (ITPs) respirators, medical masks, and reusable face coverings to help prevent COVID-19. It describes use of different mathematical models under varying scenarios to inform efficacy of single and combined use of NPIs as important counter-measures to break the cycle of COVID-19 infection including new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Demand for face masks during COVID-19 pandemic keeps increasing, especially for FFPs worn by medical workers. Collaborative and well-conducted randomised controlled trials across borders are required to generate robust data to inform common and consistent policies for COVID-19 and future pandemic planning and management; however, current use of systematic reviews of best available evidence can be considered to guide interim policies.

AB  - Orienting societies towards sustainability requires comprehensive learning of how to think, act and live within a safe and just space for humanity. Approaching sustainability as a core paradigm of quality education in the twenty-first century, Education for Sustainable Development necessitates an integrated view on learning. For educational organizations, Whole Institution Approaches (WIAs) to sustainability emphasize that all learning is embedded within its socio-physical contexts. Although the core objective-to "walk the talk" on sustainability-is theoretically well established, questions remain regarding its specific conceptualizations. Based on a systematic qualitative analysis of 104 international documents from scientific and grey literature, this article offers a conceptual synthesis of the core elements of WIAs to sustainability in education. Based on the literature analysis, WIAs are described as continuous and participative organizational learning processes aimed at institutional coherence on sustainability, consistently linking the formal and informal (hidden) curricula. While specific pathways are necessary for diverse organizations, the article synthesizes a joint framework. Key characteristics of WIAs are clustered within five core principles (coherence, continuous learning, participation, responsibility, long-term commitment), seven highly integrated areas of action (governance, curriculum, campus, community, research, communication, capacity building), the underlying organizational culture, and critical conditions for successful implementation. As becomes clear from the synthesis, following a WIA means to collaboratively switch the default mode of all rules-in-use to sustainability. The concept of WIAs may thus both be approached as an instrument for consistent organizational development in light of (un-)sustainability and as a keystone of integrated high-quality sustainability learning.

AB  - Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources.
   We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research.
   The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa.
   Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied.
   Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.

AB  - Temperate rocky reefs are complex habitats that support high levels of biodiversity and productivity. However, the sessile benthic communities attached to these reefs are vulnerable to climate change and local human impacts due to their limited capacity to rapidly avoid unfavourable environments. In southeastern Australia, high latitude rocky reefs face increasing threats from rapid warming, surpassing the global average. Existing management efforts for these reefs rely heavily on research from tropical coral ecosystems and shallow temperate algal-dominated rocky reefs, where sufficient data allows for reliable predictions on the future state of the systems. Recent evidence from seabed mapping programs indicates that mesophotic reefs (similar to 30-150 m depth) are equally or more extensive than shallow systems in temperate waters. They provide novel ecosystem functions and could potentially act as climate refuges for some components of shallow water communities that extend across depth strata. However, despite their importance, very little is known about the threats faced by non-algal sessile organisms in either shallow water or mesophotic systems in many parts of the world, including temperate Australia. This review examined the current state of knowledge regarding the direct impact of physical disturbances, such as extreme weather events, ocean warming and destructive fishing practices, on sessile mesophotic communities in general. We then used this to infer the likely drivers of change in temperate mesophotic systems. We found that Australia's temperate mesophotic ecosystems were less likely to be impacted by fishing, anchoring and lost fishing gears compared to the northern hemisphere due to lower population density. Instead, we identified present and future pulsed warming events and severe storms as major threats to Australia's mesophotic systems. This conclusion is based on the lack of evidence supporting the existence of depth refuges from climate events in the current literature and the potential implications of the predicted future increases in high wind-wave energy and warming extending into the mesophotic depths. Drawing from observations globally, changes in the distribution of growth forms, size or diversity of sponges may be useful indicators of heat stress and seabed disturbances in temperate mesophotic systems.

AB  - Climate change is shifting rainfall patterns, air temperature, river flows, and sea levels globally, resulting in changes in ground and surface water quality due to salinization, especially in arid and semiarid regions. During dry periods, the main water quality issue is a high quantity of salt in the water. Whilst water with fewer than 3,000 mg/L total salts is beneficial to all livestock species, tolerances vary greatly based on conditions and circumstances. Understanding the normal salt tolerance of animals without harming their production and health is important for sustainable livestock production, especially in dry areas. Understanding the normal salt tolerance of animals without harming their production and health is important for sustainable livestock production, especially in dry areas. Thus, this review examined the physiological, behavioral, hematological, and biochemical responses of sheep and goats in dryland areas under climate change scenarios. Despite changes in physiological, blood, biochemical, feed and water intake, sheep and goats adapt to salinity levels to drinking water in arid environments. Adaptable and native breeds are known to be more tolerant of saline water than selected exotic breeds. Small ruminants experience a decrease in food intake and weight, a decrease in breathing rate, and an increase in blood metabolite concentration when the salt in their drinking water increases. The concept that native and adapted small ruminant breeds can withstand high water salinity is gaining popularity in scientific research worldwide. More research is needed to investigate the water tolerance capabilities of adapted breeds, especially in dry and water-saline regions affected by climate change.

AB  - Purpose - The research is geared towards studying the impact of "GDP per capita (GDP)", "energy consumption (EC)", "human capital (HC)" and "trade openness (TO)" on India's ecological footprint (EF) from 1997-1998 to 2019-2020.
   Design/methodology/approach - The autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) bound test was used to look at the short-run and long-term coefficients and the cointegration of the variables.
   Findings - The results depicted a long-run connection between the variables. The long-run results found a favourable relationship between GDP, EC and EF, indicating that economic growth through heavy reliance on fossil fuels contributes to environmental unsustainability. An inverse relationship between HC, TOand EF was also observed, indicating that education fosters pro-environmental behaviour and leads to adopting cleaner technology that contributes to environmental sustainability.
   Research limitations/implications - The research substantiates India's pressing requirement for sustainable development, ensuring a harmonious balance between economic performance and environmental preservation. A carefully designed policy needs to be formulated to mitigate emissions stemming from growth in India. Policymakers are urged to implement measures that promote ecologically friendly tools, utilities and transportation to curb long-term environmental degradation.
   Originality/value - The study is novel, incorporating an exhaustive review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). This study further examines how India's EF is affected by its HC; the preceding literature has yet to discuss much about the connection between HC and the environment. Finally, the study employed advanced econometric techniques, namely the cointegration technique and ARDL model, to find the relationship between EF, GDP, HC, EC and TO.

AB  - Purpose Crowdfunding (CF) is a fast-developing and multifaceted phenomenon at the intersection of entrepreneurship, technology, finance and sociology. Although it is an alternative way to fund innovative projects using the internet, CF can provide great value other than money. Nevertheless, only few studies have been conducted to shed light on such additional benefits. The purpose of this paper is to present an integrative model of benefits of CF for the successful undertaking and sustainability of an entrepreneurial initiative. Design/methodology/approach Based on a systematic review of literature, a preliminary taxonomy is first identified. Industry experts, campaign creators and the analysis of real cases are then used to progressively build a model of 11 areas and 85 categories of benefits deriving from CF. Findings The paper presents a comprehensive model of benefits of CF for the project, the start-up and the creator related to the following aspects: viability, costs, customer, demand, distribution, employees, fund, strategy, market, partners, personal, product. Research limitations/implications - The study does not distinguish among different forms of CF. Besides, only benefits are studied whereas potential drawbacks and challenges are not considered. Further research is thus needed to complement the framework along such two additional areas of investigation. Originality/value The theoretical framework is an exhaustive snapshot of the benefits of a CF campaign and it can thus be assumed as a starting point for future and empirical studies. Moreover, the paper can support platforms managers in the design of values-added tools aimed to improve attractiveness and project creators in campaign design and management.

AB  - Current changes in food systems in low- and middle-income countries are not only associated with increasing demand for food driven by population growth. Shifts in diets with different production and processing structures likely have a more considerable impact in future: higher land requirements (e.g., more animal-based proteins) or changing production regions and structures (e.g., higher share of (imported) processed food). Whether the expected transition in low- and middle-income countries that is considerably larger than in high income countries is resilient, is questionable. Beyond, the resilience of food systems is not consistently assessed and hardly synthesized for low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review based on a keyword search was therefore conducted to identify research gaps on food system resilience for low- and middle-income countries.
   This review identified three clusters of studies: studies in cluster 1 (global models and primary production) mainly model global (change) impacts on crop production, mostly disregard the downstream of the value chain and use globally accessible crop data (e.g., for cereals). Studies in cluster 2 (farmers' behavior under global change) mainly analyze with surveys and workshop formats the resilience of farmers and farming households under global change phenomena such as climate change and equally explore especially farmers' adaptative capacity. Studies in cluster 3 (food systems and value chains) take a more holistic perspective and mostly qualitatively analyze the resilience of food systems based on existing studies. Quantitatively, most studies model the robustness of food systems and not their transformability.
   Future research should quantitatively assess the adaptiveness and transformability of food systems and study the resilience of food systems beyond primary production. Studies should quantitatively model the impact between the food system and associated environmental and social systems and along the food value chain to generate relevant insights for food system governance.

AB  - IntroductionUniversal health coverage (UHC) is an emerging priority of health systems worldwide and central to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (target 3.8). Critical to the achievement of UHC, is quality of care. However, current evidence suggests that quality of care is suboptimal, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The primary objective of this scoping review was to summarize the existing conceptual and empirical literature on quality of care within the context of UHC and identify knowledge gaps.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework and further elaborated by Levac et al. and applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL-Plus, PAIS Index, ProQuest and PsycINFO for reviews published between 1 January 1995 and 27 September 2021. Reviews were eligible for inclusion if the article had a central focus on UHC and discussed quality of care. We did not apply any country-based restrictions. All screening, data extraction and analyses were completed by two reviewers.ResultsOf the 4128 database results, we included 45 studies that met the eligibility criteria, spanning multiple geographic regions. We synthesized and analysed our findings according to Kruk et al.'s conceptual framework for high-quality systems, including foundations, processes of care and quality impacts. Discussions of governance in relation to quality of care were discussed in a high number of studies. Studies that explored the efficiency of health systems and services were also highly represented in the included reviews. In contrast, we found that limited information was reported on health outcomes in relation to quality of care within the context of UHC. In addition, there was a global lack of evidence on measures of quality of care related to UHC, particularly country-specific measures and measures related to equity.ConclusionThere is growing evidence on the relationship between quality of care and UHC, especially related to the governance and efficiency of healthcare services and systems. However, several knowledge gaps remain, particularly related to monitoring and evaluation, including of equity. Further research, evaluation and monitoring frameworks are required to strengthen the existing evidence base to improve UHC.

AB  - Climate change and global warming interconnected with the new contexts created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have brought serious challenges to national and international organizations, especially in terms of food security and agricultural planning. These circumstances are of particular concern due to the impacts on food chains and the resulting disruptions in supply and price changes. The digital agricultural transition in Era 4.0 can play a decisive role in dealing with these new agendas, where drones and sensors, big data, the internet of things and machine learning all have their inputs. In this context, the main objective of this study is to highlight insights from the literature on the relationships between machine learning and food security and their contributions to agricultural planning in the context of Agriculture 4.0. For this, a systematic review was carried out based on information from text and bibliographic data. The proposed objectives and methodologies represent an innovative approach, namely, the consideration of bibliometric evaluation as a support for a focused literature review related to the topics addressed here. The results of this research show the importance of the digital transition in agriculture to support better policy and planning design and address imbalances in food chains and agricultural markets. New technologies in Era 4.0 and their application through Climate-Smart Agriculture approaches are crucial for sustainable businesses (economically, socially and environmentally) and the food supply. Furthermore, for the interrelationships between machine learning and food security, the literature highlights the relevance of platforms and methods, such as, for example, Google Earth Engine and Random Forest. These and other approaches have been considered to predict crop yield (wheat, barley, rice, maize and soybean), abiotic stress, field biomass and crop mapping with high accuracy (R2 approximate to 0.99 and RMSE approximate to 1%).

AB  - Objectives: The implant abutments, which had their own colour, might cause the discoloration of peri-implant mucosa. We aimed to appraise trails comparing the discoloration of peri-implant soft tissue around zirconia and titanium or golden abutments, the tints of which were vastly different.
   Data: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), cohort studies with patients rehabilitated with zirconia, titanium or golden implant abutments, quantitatively comparing the discoloration of peri-implant soft tissue according to CIE-Lab colour scale.
   Sources: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CDSR, and CENTRAL databases without any restriction on September 23, 2017. "Grey" literatures were also searched. A manual search was carried out as well.
   Study selection: Of 584 articles initially retrieved, eight were eligible for inclusion. After data extraction, meta-analyses with mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed. Moreover, the risk of bias within or across studies was assessed by Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, funnel plots, or Egger's test.
   Results: Four RCTs and four cohort studies were included. Soft-tissue discoloration around zirconia abutments was significantly less likely compared to that around titanium abutments (MD=-1.84; 95% CI=-3.62 to -0.07; P=0.04 < 0.05) or golden abutments (MD=-0.90; 95% CI=-1.60 to -0.20; P=0.01 < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Zirconia abutments with white tint compared to grey titanium or golden abutments seem to restore a more appropriate colour match between peri-implant mucosa and natural teeth. Clinical significance: Based on the present evidence, the "nature-like" zirconia abutments should be applied more often in the clinic.

AB  - We are entering an era where species declines are occurring at their fastest ever rate, and the increased spread of non-native species is among the top causes. High uncertainty in biological processes makes the accurate prediction of the outcomes of management interventions very challenging. Adaptive management (AM) offers solutions to reduce uncertainty and improve predictability so that the outcomes of interventions can continuously improve.
   We quantitatively assess the extent to which AM is used for managing vertebrates, with a focus on invasive non-native species (INNS). Using the Web of Science, we evaluated 3992 articles returned by the search terms 'adaptive management' or 'adaptive harvest management' against seven recommended elements of AM (engagement with stakeholders, defining objectives, forecasting and estimating uncertainty, implementing management, monitoring populations, adjusting management in response to monitoring, and improving forecasting and reducing uncertainty in response to monitoring populations).
   The use of AM for vertebrates was reported in 56 (1%) of the evaluated studies; including four for managing INNS. Of these, ten studies excluding INNS and no studies of INNS management implemented all seven recommended elements of AM. Those elements infrequently implemented were as follows: the use of analysis or models to forecast and represent uncertainty (44%) and the feedback of monitoring data to improve forecasting and reduce uncertainty (25%).
   Complete active AM has rarely been implemented and reported for managing INNS, despite the significant advantages it offers. Among studies purporting to have implemented AM, most did not use analyses or models to forecast and represent uncertainty, while most defined objectives, implemented management, and monitored populations.
   Improvements to ongoing control programmes and much broader adoption of the AM approach are required to increase the efficiency and success of INNS management campaigns and reduce their negative impacts on native species.

AB  - Background Poorly managed animal faecal waste can result in detrimental environmental and public health implications. Limiting human exposure to animal waste through Animal inclusive Water Sanitation and Hygiene (A-WASH) strategies is imperative to improve public health in livestock keeping households but has received little attention to date. A small number of A-WASH interventions have previously been identified through a systematic review by another research team, and published in 2017. To inform intervention design with the most up-to-date information, a scoping study was conducted to map the existing evidence for A-WASH in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) emerging since the previous review.Methods This review followed PRISMA guidelines to identify interventions in SSA published between January 2016 to October 2022. Databases searched included PubMed, PMC Europe, CabDirect and Web of Science. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were written in English and documented interventions limiting human contact with animal faecal material in the SSA context. Key data extracted included: the intervention itself, its target population, cost, measure of effectiveness, quantification of effect, assessment of success, acceptability and limitations. These data were synthesized into a narrative, structured around the intervention type.Findings Eight eligible articles were identified. Interventions to reduce human exposure to animal faecal matter were conducted in combination with 'standard' human-centric WASH practices. Identified interventions included the management of human-animal co-habitation, educational programs and the creation of child-safe spaces. No novel A-WASH interventions were identified in this review, beyond those identified by the review in 2017. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) were used to evaluate six of the eight identified interventions, but as effect was evaluated through various measures, the ability to formally compare efficacy of interventions is lacking.Conclusion This study indicates that the number of A-WASH studies in SSA is increasing and the use of RCTs suggests a strong desire to create high-quality evidence within this field. There is a need for standardisation of effect measures to enable meta-analyses to be conducted to better understand intervention effectiveness. Evaluation of scalability and sustainability of interventions is still lacking in A - WASH research.

AB  - IntroductionNearly 50% of depressed primary care patients referred to mental health services do not initiate mental health treatment. The most promising interventions for increasing depression treatment initiation in primary care settings remain unclear.MethodsWe performed a systematic search of publicly available databases from inception through August 2017 to identify interventions designed to increase depression treatment initiation. Two authors independently selected, extracted data, and rated risk of bias from included studies. Eligible studies used a randomized or pre-post design and assessed depression treatment initiation (i.e., 1 mental health visit or antidepressant fill) among adults, the majority of whom met criteria for depression. Interventions were classified as simple or complex and sub-classified into intervention strategies that were graded for strength of evidence.ResultsOf 9516 articles identified, we included 14 unique studies representing 16 (4 simple and 12 complex) interventions and 8 treatment initiation strategies. We found low to moderate strength of evidence for collaborative/integrated care (3 studies), treatment preference matching (2 studies), and case management (2 studies) strategies. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of cultural tailoring (2 studies), motivation (alone, with reminders or with cultural tailoring (5 studies)), education (1 study), and shared decision-making strategies (1 study). Overall, we found moderate strength of evidence for complex interventions (8 of 12 complex interventions demonstrated statistically significant effects on treatment initiation).DiscussionCollaborative/integrated care, preference treatment matching, and case management strategies had the best evidence for improving depression treatment initiation, but none of the strategies had high strength of evidence. While primary care settings can consider using some of these strategies when referring depressed patients to treatment, our review highlights the need for further rigorous research in this area.

AB  - Smart cities need to take advantage of the opportunities that the knowledge-based economy and society can bring to the city. Therefore, cities planners and decision makers need to develop cities that take advantage of local knowledge and the intellectual capital of the population. Organizational culture is widely held to be a major barrier to creating and leveraging knowledge. Successful implementation of knowledge management (KM) almost always requires a culture change in order to promote a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration. Hence, organizations implementing smart cities need to place great emphasis on the need to change organizational culture to pursue effective KM and its successful implementation. However, the management of culture change is a complicated task; its precise nature in smart-city development and the strategies required to be adopted remains underspecified. This study aimed to explore organizational cultural transformation needed for managing knowledge in the context of smart cities. The methodological approach for this study is a systematic review, covering publications on smart cities, KM, and organizational culture. The method used in this study involved three stages: planning the review, conducting the review, and reporting and disseminating the results. The findings revealed three key themes which are: organizational perspectives of smart cities; organizational change, innovation, and digital transformation; and the relationship between organizational culture and KM. The paper concludes that the cultural transformation required for the development of smart cities needs to facilitate the ability to integrate, create and reconfigure both internal and external competences to manage knowledge that originates from within and beyond projects boundaries. This study provides an insight into urban policymakers, planners, and scholars to prepare for the challenges that organizations face in their efforts to manage and implement smart cities successfully.

AB  - As the global footprint of urban areas expands, there is increasing motivation to conserve biodiversity in these areas. Cities typically develop in fertile, biodiverse locations, and often contain relatively high numbers of threatened species. Despite this, urban landscapes are often overlooked as conservation priorities. Although birds have been extensively studied in urban areas, research effort may not be consistent among species. An unbalanced representation of species and collective tendencies to focus on particular research topics pose a risk to the completeness of our understanding of urban ornithology. Developing a better understanding of how birds are studied in urban areas is crucial to mitigate the risk of biodiversity loss. Here, we conducted a systematic quantitative literature review to determine research effort at the species level for birds in Australian urban areas. We modelled which species characteristics predict the level of species research effort across studies with varying levels of conservation relevance and study themes. We found that studies with a strong link to conservation were uncommon and that most studies targeted broad suites of species rather than specific groups or species. Species characteristics, including species taxonomic group, migratory behaviour, threat status and body mass, were significant predictors of research effort. These results highlight the biases that exist in urban bird research, showing that applied conservation is uncommon and usually broad. Understanding the biases in Australian urban ornithology establishes a foundation for expected biases on other continents, which once addressed will be beneficial to conserving urban bird biodiversity.

AB  - Waste generated from electrical and electronic equipment collectively known as e-waste has remained a persistent environmental problem. Globally, approximately 53.6 million tons of e-waste was generated in 2019. Of this amount generated, less than 13% was recycled and the rest ended up in landfills or incinerators creating enormous environmental and health concerns due to the presence of hazardous materials. While there are several previous-studies on e-waste, research findings of the United Nations global e-waste report 2020 shows that many countries are not sufficiently managing e-waste generated and greater effort is urgently required to ensure smarter and more sustainable e-waste management. On this premise, this study critically reviews previous research on e-waste generation and management practices of selected-countries Canada, France, United States, United Kingdom, Nigeria and South Africa; provides an overview of progress made and identifies areas for improvement. These countries are selected because they are some of the largest-producers of e-waste worldwide. To achieve the objectives of this study, previous-studies from 2005 to 2020 are collected from databases. The study focuses on aspects such as e-waste generation, e-waste recycling, e-waste disposal methods and behaviour, environmental management of e-waste, e-waste problems and challenges and e-waste legislation of these countries. This study further categorised previous-studies of selected-countries in relation to type and scope of research, e-waste categories evaluated and study locations. Based on the findings/outcomes of the analysis on the current-situation of the selected-countries in the literature, this study proposes generic best-practice approaches to e-waste generation and environmental management taking into account country-specific issues and identifies future research areas.

AB  - BackgroundGlobally, there is renewed interest in and momentum for strengthening community health systems, as also emphasized by the recent Astana Declaration. Recent reviews have identified factors critical to successful community health worker (CHW) programs but pointed to significant evidence gaps. This review aims to propose a global research agenda to strengthen CHW programs.Methods and resultsWe conducted a search for extant systematic reviews on any intermediate factors affecting the effectiveness of CHW programs in February 2018. A total of 30 articles published after year 2000 were included. Data on research gaps were abstracted and summarized under headings based on predominant themes identified in the literature. Following this data gathering phase, two technical advisory groups comprised of experts in the field of community healthincluding policymakers, implementors, researchers, advocates and donorswere convened to discuss, validate, and prioritize the research gaps identified.Research gap areas that were identified in the literature and validated through expert consultation include selection and training of CHWs, community embeddedness, institutionalization of CHW programs (referrals, supervision, and supply chain), CHW needs including incentives and remuneration, governance and sustainability of CHW programs, performance and quality of care, and cost-effectiveness of CHW programs. Priority research questions included queries on effective policy, financing, governance, supervision and monitoring systems for CHWs and community health systems, implementation questions around the role of digital technologies, CHW preferences, and drivers of CHW motivation and retention over time.ConclusionsAs international interest and investment in CHW programs and community health systems continue to grow, it becomes critical not only to analyze the evidence that exists, but also to clearly define research questions and collect additional evidence to ensure that CHW programs are effective, efficient, equity promoting, and evidence based. Generally, the literature places a strong emphasis on the need for higher quality, more robust research.

AB  - Purpose - With the worldwide growth of the Chinese tourism market, a number of studies have emerged, that attempt to understand the phenomenon, including the influence of Chinese culture on Chinese tourist behavior. This research aims to answer four questions: How has Chinese culture been adopted in tourism literature? What is the current state of tourism research on Chinese culture? What are the similarities, differences and research gaps between international and Chinese studies in this area of investigation? What are the directions that future tourism research will take?
   Design/methodology/approach - The articles for this systematic review were published in major international hospitality and tourism journals and Chinese journals over a period of 20 years (1993-2012). A meta-review was carried out on 80 Chinese and English tourism literature dating from 1993 to 2012.
   Findings - This review showed that Chinese culture has been fragmentally operationalized due to underdeveloped Chinese cultural theories in tourism, independent and unrelated extant cultural systems and perspectives and lack of empirical testing for theory development. Two major theoretical systems of Chinese culture in tourist research were revealed in this review: cross-cultural theory and traditional Chinese cultural framework. The current state of tourism research on Chinese culture was also analyzed. The similarities, differences and research gaps were identified between international and Chinese studies on this inquiry. Implications for future tourism research in this area were suggested.
   Research limitations/implications - Unveiling the evolving research progress of a single culture helps to provide a deeper insight into how culture was used to analyze the behavior of individual tourist markets, and hence to better understand a particular tourist market.
   Originality/value - This research has synthesized a wide range of literature to unveil the extant understanding of Chinese culture as reflected in Chinese tourists and outline the ways forward in this area of investigation.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) has become worldwide an effective pathway for sustainable development against the linear model. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) tools have been identified either as booster of circularity and as supporter for the achievement of sustainable development goals. Environmental Management System (EMS), Green Public Procurement (GPP), Ecodesign Directive, Ecolabel, Energy Label and Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) have been considered either by academic and practitioners as tools useful to promote CE. Although the attention on SCP tools and CE has growth, no studies have investigated the linkages between these two topics. To bridge this gap, the aim of this study is to provide a literature review on the integration between CE and SCP tools. The revisited material consisted of 455 studies and was evaluated using a systematic approach. By critically analysing 35 papers, the study identified EMS and Ecodesign as the tools with the highest level of integration with CE, while the other tools seem to be characterized by a "stand-alone" approach. However, the in-depth analysis of the results highlighted that there is still room for improvement of scholars' contribution on the integration between SCP tools and CE. We identified three main areas for future research agenda in order to spur further academic and technical debate. The first major area concerns the role of EMS in increasing organisations' circularity; The second main area includes Ecodesign Directive and ETV in the design and manufacturing processes of the products; the third main area focuses on GPP, Ecolabel and Energy Label in driving greener consumption by setting products' circular criteria.

AB  - Syntheses of knowledge are important to reveal trends, biases and gaps in the scientific literature, indicating main data shortfalls and research needs. In this regard, the authors conducted a broad systematic review on the literature about freshwater fish eggs and larvae to investigate (a) temporal trends in the global scientific production, (b) the scope and habitat types, (c) the spatial distribution of studies, (d) the fish species contemplated and their respective conservation status and (e) the factors associated with the spatial distribution of studies. They analysed 654 studies published between 1950 and 2020. The number of studies has increased over time, but with a weak trend. Most studies investigated basic questions about biology and ecology and were carried out chiefly in rivers and lakes. These studies covered 95 freshwater ecoregions (22.3% of all ecoregions) and recorded 871 fish species (4.8% of all freshwater fish currently described). Most species were assessed by the IUCN and classified into six threat categories, but approximately 35% were not evaluated. The main drivers affecting the spatial distribution of studies were ecoregion area, road density, river volume and the number of hydroelectric plants. Results point to significant biases and gaps in the global scientific literature on fish eggs and larvae, especially associated with habitat type, spatial distribution and target species, emphasizing the need to address specific topics. Such biases and gaps indicate the existence of important data shortfalls, which compromise management and conservation planning, as information on fish eggs and larvae is basic and critical for the assessment of fish recruitment and population dynamics.

AB  - In recent decades, industrial park (IP) development has been an important practice for regional economic development for various geographies. Eco-industrial park (EIP) development, on the other hand, has been proposed as an alternative, considering environmental problems raised from the high number of agglomerated industries in IPs. Although there are some quite progressive EIP experiences that are globally distributed, IP development remains the mainstream industrial agglomeration model and has not yet experienced a transition into EIP development. The purpose of this article is both to understand and shed some light on how such a transition can be achieved through lessons from the EIP cases in the existing state of the art and to establish a research agenda that would elaborate on sustainability transitions into EIP development. To achieve these aims, a systematic literature review involving a case survey is conducted. A theoretical framework with an evolutionary perspective is developed drawing on EIP literature and strategic niche management (SNM) framework from sustainability transitions research. This connects two streams of research that have not been closely associated in the past. While synthesising 104 EIP cases from 24 countries, three analytical processes of SNM are considered: (i) articulation of expectations and visions, (ii) building of social networks, and (iii) learning activities. This article also discusses the development of local EIP experiments and EIP niche formation at different geographies. Based on this synthesis, policy implications are suggested and research implications are provided, stressing critical and interesting issues that have not yet had an explicit focus in the literature. This article enables cross-fertilisation across globally distributed EIP cases while adding to the critical mass in leveraging EIP development.

AB  - Forest sustainable management aims to maintain the income of woody goods for companies, together with preserving non-productive functions as a benefit for the community. Due to the progress in platforms and sensors and the opening of the dedicated market, unmanned aerial vehicle-remote sensing (UAV-RS) is improving its key role in the forestry sector as a tool for sustainable management. The use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in precision forestry has exponentially increased in recent years, as demonstrated by more than 600 references published from 2018 until mid-2020 that were found in the Web of Science database by searching for "UAV" + "forest". This result is even more surprising when compared with similar research for "UAV" + "agriculture", from which emerge about 470 references. This shows how UAV-RS research forestry is gaining increasing popularity. In Part II of this review, analyzing the main findings of the reviewed papers (227), numerous strengths emerge concerning research technical issues. UAV-RS is fully applicated for obtaining accurate information from practical parameters (height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and biomass). Research effectiveness and soundness demonstrate that UAV-RS is now ready to be applied in a real management context. Some critical issues and barriers in transferring research products are also evident, namely, (1) hyperspectral sensors are poorly used, and their novel applications should be based on the capability of acquiring tree spectral signature especially for pest and diseases detection, (2) automatic processes for image analysis are poorly flexible or based on proprietary software at the expense of flexible and open-source tools that can foster researcher activities and support technology transfer among all forestry stakeholders, and (3) a clear lack exist in sensors and platforms interoperability for large-scale applications and for enabling data interoperability.

AB  - The growing number of studies on road network pricing requires adoption of systematic methodologies to assess research outcomes and provide an unbiased summary of research findings and lessons learned. This paper aims to identify and analyse primary studies related to a set of research questions on road network pricing that primarily address the effectiveness of road network pricing as a travel demand management strategy. The paper achieves this by consolidating the fragmented evidence on the topic and identifying the role of transport pricing in steering our post-pandemic cities on a path of sustainable urban mobility. The paper uses a reliable and auditable systematic approach to examine past and current research trends, resulting in a rational assessment of the role and impacts of road network pricing as a travel demand management strategy. The paper achieves this by performing a bibliometric citation analysis that identifies 105 articles of valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge in the development of research covering the period between 2007 and 2020. Importantly, the review identifies four main research themes in the literature, namely implementation impacts, innovations in technology, acceptability, and modelling methodologies for determining impacts, that are core elements of the research effort on the travel demand management and sustainability aspects of road pricing. Inductive reasoning is then used to address emerging issues, applications, and the effects of road network pricing in reducing congestion and enhancing urban centre environmental quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy directions for overcoming barriers to the implementation of road network pricing as an effective strategy for addressing modern-day urban mobility challenges such as rising urban populations, emissions, and pollution particularly amid and post COVID-19. Finally, the paper provides a roadmap of future research opportunities that can heighten the role of road network pricing in shaping the directions of sustainable urban transport policies and strategies.

AB  - Background: Africa is facing the triple burden of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and nutritional disorders. Multilateral institutions, bilateral arrangements, and philanthropies have historically privileged economic development over health concerns. That focus has resulted in weak health systems and inadequate preparedness when there are outbreaks of diseases. This review aims to understand the politics of disease control in Africa and global health diplomacy's (GHD's) critical role.
   Methods: A literature review was done in Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google scholar search engines. Keywords included MeSH and common terms related to the topics: "Politics," "disease control," "epidemics/ endemics," and "global health diplomacy" in the "African" context. The resources also included reports of World Health Organization, United Nations and resolutions of the World Health Assembly (WHA).
   Results: African countries continue to struggle in their attempts to build health systems for disease control that are robust enough to tackle the frequent epidemics that plague the continent. The politics of disease control requires the crafting of cooperative partnerships to accommodate the divergent interests of multiple actors. Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and Ebola had a significant impact on African economies. It is extremely important to prioritize health in the African development agendas. The African Union (AU) should leverage the momentum of the rise of GHD to (i) navigate the politics of global health governance in an interconnected world(ii) develop robust preparedness and disease response strategies to tackle emerging and reemerging disease epidemics in the region (iii) address the linkages between health and broader human security issues driven by climate change-induced food, water, and other insecurities (iv) mobilize resources and capacities to train health officials in the craft of diplomacy.
   Conclusion: The AU, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and African Centres for Disease Control should harmonize their plans and strategies and align them towards a common goal that integrates health in African development agendas. The AU must innovatively harness the practice and tools of GHD towards developing the necessary partnerships with relevant actors in the global health arena to achieve the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Social, environmental, and economic problems related to urban living have surpassed the agenda of policy and decision-makers as well as general public opinion in recent decades. To address urban and environmental issues, it is pivotal to examine how people think, feel, judge, and act with respect to sustainability. While some prominent theories exist and various attempts have been made to propose synthesized models, there are still gaps and discrepancies within the literature of environmental psychological theories. As such, the aim of this paper is to critically review the literature by focusing on a few of the most influential environmental, prosocial, and psychological behaviour theories, which include Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Norm Activation Theory (NAT), Value-Belief-Norm Theory (VBN), and the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP). The Scopus database has been searched systematically for the relevant studies. This paper concludes that an integrative approach to urban sustainability understanding and behaviour is needed. A framework is presented that consists of three layers of clustered components: (1) internal socio-psychological determinants, (2) personality traits, and (3) influencing external factors such as social, cultural, economic, and institutional factors. The model proposed in the study provides opportunities to further develop theoretical approaches and establish new measures of an Urban Sustainability Understanding and Behaviour assessment.

AB  - The response-and-effect framework is a trait-based approach that seeks to break down the mechanistic links between ecosystem disturbances, species' traits, and ecosystem processes. We apply this framework to a review of the literature on coral reef fish traits, in order to illustrate the research landscape and structure a path forward for the field. Traits were categorized into five broad groupings: behavioral, life history, morphological, diet, and physiological. Overall, there are fewer studies linking effect traits to ecosystem processes (number of papers on herbivory, n = 14; predation, n = 12; bioerosion, n = 2; nutrient cycling, n = 0) than there are linking response traits to disturbances (climate change, n = 26; fishing, n = 20; pollution, n = 4). Through a network analysis, we show that the size and diet of fish are two of the most common response and effect traits currently used in the literature, central to studies on both ecosystem disturbances and processes. Behavioral and life history traits are more commonly shown to respond to disturbances, while morphological traits tend to be used in capturing ecosystem processes. Pearson correlation coefficients quantifying the strength of the relationships between the most commonly studied process, herbivory, and key effect traits (size, gregariousness, and diel activity) are provided. We find that the most popular cluster of traits used in functional diversity metrics (e.g., functional richness, functional dispersion) is comprised of size, diet, space use/position in the water column, diel activity, gregariousness, and mobility, which encompass three of the broad trait categories. Our assessment of the literature highlights that more research is needed to support an evidence-based selection of traits to understand and predict ecosystem functioning. In synthesizing the literature, we identify research gaps and provide an avenue toward a more robust trait-selection process.

AB  - Background: Despite a high rate of bicycle ownership, the prevalence of cycling to school among children and adolescents in Germany has been constantly low. Cycling to school can contribute to meeting the physical activity recommendations, which the majority of children and adolescents in Germany do not meet.
   Methods: By using intervention mapping, this study protocol describes the systematic planning process of a school-based intervention in Germany aimed to increase the number of days on which students cycle to school and to increase their physical activity levels. To make sure that the intervention will match the needs of students, we conducted a concept mapping study investigating what students need to cycle to school, as perceived by students, parents, and teachers. The logic model of change was based on an integration of the self-determination theory and the social-ecological model. We structured our intervention as two phases, a preparatory phase with weekly components for and a practical phase with a daily repeated component of the targeted behavior. In the 8-week preparatory phase, teachers, parents, and peers will be involved. The content of the 12-week practical phase will involve peers only and was considered promising based on the findings from a systematic review that we conducted to identify the effective strategies of school-based interventions to promote cycling to school among children and adolescents. Overall, our intervention includes 27 behavior change techniques. A researcher, student assistants, teachers, and other collaborators will implement the intervention; a whole-of-school approach with components performed before, during, and after school was chosen. As a study design, we decided to draft a two-arm three-level cluster randomized controlled trial. Both the effect and process evaluation were prepared. In the first instance, approximately 250 students of 12-15 years of age from grade 7 or 8, who attend a secondary school of intermediate or high educational level located in (sub)urban regions in Southern Germany, will pilot the intervention.
   Discussion: We expect to provide an effective and sustainable intervention for students, which gives insights into the mechanisms of change concerning the behavior of cycling to school and its influence on physical activity levels.

AB  - The potential for organic farming (OF) as a system that enhances climate change (CC) adaptation and improves food security in Africa has been a provocative topic in global discussions. Although OF is promptly increasing globally, the pertinent question is to figure out how OF can result in sustainable food production systems. This systematic literature review was undertaken through two database searches to maximize available data and relevant literature (Scopus and Wiley Online Library), resulting in 2069 documents published between 2007 and 2022. After excluding documents that were duplicates, not presented in English and irrelevant, 538 documents remained. From the remaining documents, 406 were excluded after careful review (not meeting at least one of the inclusion criteria), and 132 documents remained. Finally, 95 documents were excluded after assessing and reviewing full-text articles for eligibility. As a result, 37 documents were included (eligible) in the systematic review. The inclusion criteria followed in this study considered language, thematic focus and document type. The reviewed articles suggest that OF can be one of the climate change adaptation options, preserve environmental impact and improve food security. However, the relative performance in OF differs from region to region. Correspondingly, the organic-conventional yield gap mostly depends on crops and cropping practices. This review concludes the prospects of organic agriculture in Southern Africa are still largely untapped, particularly by smallholder farmers who remain uncertified. Therefore, the review recommends organised interventions on various fronts, starting with organic certification and regulation. Accordingly, sustainability (economic, environmental and social) and investments in OF need to be reinforced and promoted by stakeholders, as it has the potential to alleviate the swarming farming challenges posed by climate change and to address food insecurity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for rapid and urgent guidance for clinicians to manage COVID-19 among patients and prevent transmission.
   OBJECTIVE To appraise the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) using the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) criteria.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to December 14, 2020, and a search of related articles to February 28, 2021, that included CPGs developed by societies or by government or nongovernment organizations that reported pharmacologic treatments of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed CPG quality using the 15-item National Guideline Clearinghouse Extent of Adherence to Trustworthy Standards (NEATS) instrument.
   FINDINGS Thirty-two CPGs were included in the review. Of these, 25 (78.1%) were developed by professional societies and emanated from a single World Health Organization (WHO) region. Overall, the CPGs were of low quality. Only 7 CPGs (21.9%) reported funding sources, and 12 (37.5%) reported conflicts of interest. Only 5 CPGs (15.6%) included a methodologist, described a search strategy or study selection process, or synthesized the evidence. Although 14 CPGs (43.8%) made recommendations or suggestions for or against treatments, they infrequently rated confidence in the quality of the evidence (6 of 32 [18.8%]), described potential benefits and harms (6 of 32 [18.8%]), or graded the strength of the recommendations (5 of 32 [15.6%]). External review, patient or public perspectives, or a process for updating were rare. High-quality CPGs included a methodologist and multidisciplinary collaborations involving investigators from 2 or more WHO regions.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this review, few COVID-19 CPGs met NAM standards for trustworthy guidelines. Approaches that prioritize engagement of a methodologist and multidisciplinary collaborators from at least 2 WHO regions may lead to the production of fewer, high-quality CPGs that are poised for updates as new evidence emerges.

AB  - Water, sanitation, and hygiene provisions are essential during emergencies to prevent infectious disease outbreaks caused by improper human excreta management in settlements for people affected by natural disasters and conflicts. Human excreta disinfection is required when long-term containment in latrines is not feasible on-site. Alkali additives, including lime, are effective disinfectants for wastewater and faecal sludge containing large amounts of solid and dissolved organic matter. The aim of this study was to determine the minimum dose and contact time of alkali additives for treating virus-containing human excreta in emergency situations. We used literature data collected by searching Google Scholar and Web of Science. The date of the last search for each study was 31th May 2023. Only peer-reviewed articles that included disinfection practices in combination with quantitative data for the physicochemical data of a matrix and viral decay were selected for data extraction. Two reviewers independently collected data from each study. We extracted datasets from 14 studies that reported quantitative information about their disinfection tests, including viral decay over time, matrix types, and physicochemical properties. Three machine learning algorithms were applied to the collected dataset to determine the time required to achieve specified levels of virus inactivation under different environmental conditions. The best model was used to estimate the contact time to achieve a 3-log10 inactivation of RNA virus in wastewater and faeces. The most important variables for predicting the contact time were pH, temperature, and virus type. The estimated contact time for 3 log inactivation of RNA virus was <2 h at pH 12, which was achieved by adding 1.8 and 3.1% slaked lime to wastewater and faeces, respectively. The contact time decreased exponentially with the pH of the sludge and wastewater. In contrast, the pH of the sludge and wastewater increased linearly with the slaked lime dosage. Lime treatment is a promising measure where long-term containment in latrine is not feasible in densely populated areas, as 1 day is sufficient to inactivate viruses. The relationship we have identified between required contact time and lime dosage is useful for practitioners in determining appropriate treatment conditions of human waste.

AB  - Active ageing is defined as the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age. The design of active ageing policies intersects with different overarching societal challenges, especially ageing populations, social rights and sustainability. However, there are no previous attempts to review active ageing policies in the light of these challenges and the international policy objectives and targets that are guiding the international community. The aim of this study is to systematically identify, review and analyse all national and regional policies on active ageing adopted in Italy, by applying a conceptual framework derived from main international policy initiatives in the three areas. The research was conducted in two stages. First, a case study analysis was carried out per each relevant national institution and regional government. Standardised interviews were combined with policy document search, selection and analysis. Second, we performed a policy analysis in the light of a conceptual framework adopted. This latter was composed by nine policy domains, selected and integrated from principles and objectives of three overarching international frameworks on ageing-i.e., the Regional Implementation Strategy (RIS) commitments of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA), social rights-i.e., the European Pillar of Social Rights and sustainability-i.e., the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Results pointed out that out of the identified nine policy fields, the major intervention areas by Italian policy makers concerned labour market participation, life-long learning, social and economic inequalities, health and well-being. Less attention had been given to issues such as gender and equal opportunities and sustainable cities. This systematic policy review is a milestone for understanding how active ageing policies contribute to address major societal challenges and what domains need further policy development.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this work is to analyze the petroleum industry from the perspective of sustainability, taking into account its three dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Likewise, the objective is to identify and propose factors of sustainability, in other words, categories or subdivisions that allow us to analyze in greater detail the interactions and the effects of this industry on society, which must be evaluated in each of the three dimensions for the oil sector.Design/methodology: This research was carried out by means of a systematic review of the literature, with a qualitative focus of an analytic/interpretive nature. A four-phase protocol was used for the search, using the guidelines of the PRISMA statement as a reference. This protocol describes the article selection criteria, search strategy, data extraction and procedures and tools used for the analysis.Findings: The review reveals the need to establish a consensus on the sustainability factors that must be evaluated in each of the dimensions within the oil sector, given that the results of the search show that there is no clear definition or correlation with regard to the environmental, social and economic impact in the oil-producing regions. Most of the works identified were designed as case studies and a large majority of the results of the studies are contradictory, even showing adverse effects, while others fail to identify any hazards.Originality/value: The most relevant contribution of this work is related to the identification of specific sustainability factors for the oil industry, which make it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their influence on the three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic development, environmental aspects and social aspects. This classification according to factors is important in order to provide a cross-cutting conceptual framework that is applicable to any region or situation where the problems are being analyzed that derive from oil exploitation.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, nearly 570,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, with 85% of new cases in low- and middle-income countries. The African continent is home to 35 of 40 countries with the highest cervical cancer mortality rates. In 2014, a partnership involving a rural region of Senegal, West Africa, was facing cervical cancer screening service sustainability barriers and began adapting regional-level policy to address implementation challenges. Objective: This manuscript reports the findings of a systematic literature review describing the implementation of decentralized cervical cancer prevention services in Africa, relevant in context to the Senegal partnership. We report barriers and policy-relevant recommendations through Levesque's Patient-Centered Access to Healthcare Framework and discuss the impact of this information on the partnership's approach to shaping Senegal's regional cervical cancer screening policy. Methods: The systematic review search strategy comprised two complementary sub-searches. We conducted an initial search identifying 4272 articles, then applied inclusion criteria, and ultimately 19 studies were included. Data abstraction focused on implementation barriers categorized with the Levesque framework and by policy relevance. Results: Our findings identified specific demand-side (clients and community) and supply-side (health service-level) barriers to implementation of cervical cancer screening services. We identify the most commonly reported demand- and supply-side barriers and summarize salient policy recommendations discussed within the reviewed literature. Conclusions: Overall, there is a paucity of published literature regarding barriers to and best practices in implementation of cervical cancer screening services in rural Africa. Many articles in this literature review did describe findings with notable policy implications. The Senegal partnership has consulted this literature when faced with various similar barriers and has developed two principal initiatives to address contextual challenges. Other initiatives implementing cervical cancer visual screening services in decentralized areas may find this contextual reporting of a literature review helpful as a construct for identifying evidence for the purpose of guiding ongoing health service policy adaptation.

AB  - Ambient temperature is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity, making it necessary to assess temperature-related burden of disease (BD) for the planning of public health policies and adaptive responses. To systematically review existing epidemiological evidence on temperature-related BD, we searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) on 1 September 2018. We identified 97 studies from 56 counties for this review, of which 75 reported the fraction or number of health outcomes (include deaths and diseases) attributable to temperature, and 22 reported disability-adjusted life years (include years of life lost and years lost due to disability) related to temperature. Non-optimum temperatures (i.e., heat and cold) were responsible for >2.5% of mortality in all included high-income countries/regions, and >3.0% of mortality in all included middle-income countries. Cold was mostly reported to be the primary source of mortality burden from non-optimum temperatures, but the relative role of three different temperature exposures (i.e., heat, cold, and temperature variability) in affecting morbidity and mortality remains unclear so far. Under the warming climate scenario, almost all projections assuming no population adaptation suggested future increase in heat-related but decrease in cold-related BD. However, some studies emphasized the great uncertainty in future pattern of temperature-related BD, largely depending on the scenarios of climate, population adaptation, and demography. We also identified important discrepancies and limitations in current research methodologies employed to measure temperature exposures and model temperature-health relationship, and calculate the past and project future temperature-related BD. Overall, exposure to non-optimum ambient temperatures has become and will continue to be a considerable contributor to the global and national BD, but future research is still needed to develop a stronger methodological framework for assessing and comparing temperature-related BD across different settings.

AB  - The current global food system is under threat due to significant global changes such as rapid urbanization, climate change, COVID-19 outbreak, etc. The importance of food system sustainability as a key element of sustainable cities has been gradually recognized in recent years; however, the tools for estimating food system sustainability in cities (i.e., urban food system sustainability) holistically are still scarce. Thus, this study represents a comprehensive investigation into food system studies and their impacts on achieving a sustainable community or city. This study is a subset of larger studies that aim to develop an urban food system framework, which utilizes modern approaches in framework development such as sustainability food indicators and a participatory approach. However, to achieve this, trends, gaps, and challenges of the current approach to food system studies need to be reviewed and discussed. A systematic analysis utilizing the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was conducted, and network analysis of publications was performed via VOS viewer. The results suggest applying circular principles and merging smartness and resilience thinking in developing strategies for food system sustainability. This study finds that key drivers to mitigate food crisis among countries vary. Furthermore, a context-specific framework with a more comprehensive definition of urban food systems covering the institutional processes, and food governance are also needed to achieve urban food system sustainability.

AB  - Aesthetic experience in a forest can typically be associated with attractive forest scenery that gives people a sense of visual pleasure. Characterized as a visual product based on people's reactions towards various combinations of landscape settings, features, and objects, this type of natural visual pleasure may benefit people's well-being, promotes natural and cultural heritage preservation, and encourages the growth of the eco-tourism industry. While most research on forest aesthetics focuses on non-urban settings, this study examines aesthetics in the context of urban forests. This study aims to systematically review landscape aesthetic assessment studies to propose a model for urban forests. We conducted a systematic review of research articles published from 2014 to 2020 by using three research journal databases, Science Direct, Scopus, and MDPI. In total, 55 research articles were identified and qualified for review based on the screening requirements. An additional 26 research articles were also included by using the snowball method to provide better understanding and outcomes for the study. The results were organized into these categories: definitions, benefits, philosophies, approaches, and variables for the aesthetic quality assessment in urban forest areas. In addition, we also found that aesthetic quality in urban forests is highly influenced by visual composition, visual sense, and visual conditions, which have also been proven to be important parts of forest functions and values that could contribute towards the preservation of urban green spaces.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to highlight the most important preventive measures that should be proposed by policymakers and adopted by (inter)national legislative bodies by changing existing or adopting new legal documents. The implementation of these measures should be performed by state bodies responsible for ecotourism, natural and cultural resources protection and ecotourism services users.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The theoretical legal approach was applied, based on a systematic review of international legally binding and non-binding documents related to ecotourism, adopted by relevant international organizations. Analysis of norms for preventive protection of natural and cultural values was done and followed by law-reform research in the form of recommendations that should be adopted as binding.
   Findings
   International legal documents relevant to ecotourism analysed in this paper are divided into two groups. The first regulates exclusively ecotourism issues, whereas the second deals with sustainable development and indirectly refers to ecotourism, as one of its segments. Analysed international legal documents require unambiguous norms regulating preventive protective measures in ecotourism by prescribing actual obligations and prohibitions for relevant subjects. Given recommendations are grouped into five types according to the subjects they are addressing (ecotourism experts, policymakers, legislators, natural and cultural conservationists, local communities, educators).
   Originality/value
   This study is the first that points to the need to amending international legal documents related to ecotourism through recommendations regarding natural and cultural values' preventive protection.

AB  - The term 'adaptation' is commonplace in conservation research and practice, but often without a reflection on the assumptions, expectations, or frames of reference used to define goals and actions. Communities of practice (e.g. conservation researchers, protected areas managers) have different interpretations of climate change impacts on biodiversity and different ways of defining, operationalizing and implementing adaptation. Their cognitive and motivational expectations for the future are associated with different paths to reach such desired futures. To understand how adaptation is framed in conservation, we undertook a systematic review with a thematic synthesis of the definitions of the term as used in the academic conservation literature. From a sample of 150 articles, only 36 provided a definition of adaptation. We critically appraised the explicit definitions to identify emergent themes that represent particular adaptation approaches. Themes were then grouped, and each group was assigned to a scholarly tradition, onto-epistemological approach and theoretical perspective. Based on theoretical perspectives on social change, we propose a framework (including individual cognitive basis, social interactions, and openness to alternatives) to analyse how change is framed in the definitions and how the framings influence adaptation options. The grouped themes represent passive, active, or indirect adaptation approaches. We used these themes to generate a conceptual model to guide conservation researchers and practitioners engaged in climate adaptation research, policy and management to aid reflection and understanding of the options available to design adaptation agendas and allow negotiation of diverse interests, views and expectations about the future.

AB  - BackgroundCholera still affects millions of people worldwide, especially in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) has identified surveillance and oral cholera vaccines as two critical interventions to actualise the global roadmap goals-reduction of cholera-related deaths by 90% and decreasing the number of cholera endemic countries by half by 2030. Therefore, this study aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing these two cholera interventions in LMIC settings.MethodsA scoping review using the methods presented by Arksey and O'Malley. The search strategy involved using key search terms (cholera, surveillance, epidemiology and vaccines) in three databases (PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science) and reviewing the first ten pages of Google searches. The eligibility criteria of being conducted in LMICs, a timeline of 2011-2021 and documents only in English were applied. Thematic analysis was performed, and the findings were presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension.ResultsThirty-six documents met the predefined inclusion criteria, covering 2011 to 2021. There were two themes identified regarding the implementation of surveillance: timeliness and reporting (1); and resources and laboratory capabilities (2). As for oral cholera vaccines, there were four themes identified: information and awareness (1); community acceptance and trusted community leaders (2); planning and coordination (3); and resources and logistics (4). Additionally, adequate resources, good planning and coordination were identified to be operating at the interface between surveillance and oral cholera vaccines.ConclusionFindings suggest that adequate and sustainable resources are crucial for timely and accurate cholera surveillance and that oral cholera vaccine implementation would benefit from increased community awareness and engagement of community leaders.

AB  - The study provides a systematic literature review (SLR) encompassing industrial wastewater management research from the past decade, examining enablers, challenges, and prevailing practices. Originating from manufacturing, energy production, and diverse industrial processes, industrial wastewater's handling is critical due to its potential to impact the environment and public health. The research aims to comprehend the current state of industrial wastewater management, pinpoint gaps, and outline future research prospects. The SLR methodology involves scouring the Scopus database, yielding an initial pool of 253 articles. Refinement via search code leaves 101 articles, followed by abstract screening that reduces articles to 79, and finally 66 wellfocused articles left for thorough full-text examination. Results underscore the significance of regulatory frameworks, technological innovation, and sustainability considerations as cornerstones for effective wastewater management. However, substantial impediments like; inadequate infrastructure, resource constraints and the necessity for stakeholder collaboration still exist. The study highlights emerging research domains, exemplified by advanced technologies like nanotechnology and bioremediation, alongside the pivotal role of circular economy principles in wastewater management. The SLR offers an exhaustive view of contemporary industrial wastewater management, accentuating the imperative of an all-encompassing approach that integrates regulatory, technological, and sustainability facets.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementThe 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference emphasised the need to modify practices that negatively impact biodiversity and food security in the context of global change. Following Madagascar's drought-induced famine, our systematic review supports the theory that grasslands of the Malagasy Central Highland that are subjected to human-lit fires are anthropogenically derived. Furthermore, these overly frequent fires that characterise much of the Malagasy Central Highland grasslands select poorly palatable grasses. Given the reliance on pastoralism as insurance against crop failure in Madagascar, fire-dependent practices that degrade rangeland emerge as a threat to food security and biodiversity. Education can mitigate against future humanitarian crises. Food insecurity is greatest in countries where impacts of global change are predicted to be severe. Many, like Madagascar, rely on livestock-based pastoralism (and consequently palatable rangelands) for insurance against natural disasters and crop failure. It is recognised that derived grasslands can impact climate and biodiversity. Furthermore, the well-established palatability-flammability trade-off predicts that overly-frequent fires select increasingly unpalatable, fire-adapted grassland. The drought-induced Malagasy famine of 2021 highlights the need to identify factors that threaten food security. Given the ubiquitous practice of rangeland preparation through annual, landscape-scale human-lit fires, we evaluate whether Malagasy grasslands are derived and then test for fire-driven selection of increasingly degraded and unpalatable rangelands across Madagascar's largest grassland system, the Malagasy Central Highland (MCH). We conducted a systematic literature review, evaluating for a palatability-flammability trade-off, by determining dominant Malagasy grass species, and then applying functional traits, and palatability ratings to these species. Data were extracted using a suite of relevant search terms, and of 1977 studies identified, 145 were directly relevant to the questions posed. Evidence from the review is compelling for much of the Malagasy highland grassland being derived. Furthermore, Malagasy dominant grass species are fire-adapted with poor forage-value, suggesting current burning practices negatively impact both biodiversity and pastoralism. Decreasing rangeland palatability caused by human-lit fires in a society suffering food insecurity emphasises the need to re-evaluate pastoralist burning practices. Identifying optimal fire frequencies can avert breaching fire-induced tipping points to rangeland palatability and the humanitarian crises that may follow.

AB  - Coastal areas have been increasingly affected by human activities, marine pollution and climate change are among the most important pressures affecting these environments. Human-induced pressures occur in a cumulative way and generate additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects. Knowledge on synergistic effects is crucial to coastal zone management, since they may imply a change in human uses of these systems, as well as dedicated action plans in order to reduce hazards and environmental risks. In this work, we provide an overview of the available literature on synergistic effects between climate change and chemical pollution, and discuss current knowledge, methodological approaches, and research gaps and needs. Interactions between these two pressures may be climate change dominant (climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure or toxicity) or contaminant-dominant (chemical exposure leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility), but the mechanistic drivers of such processes are not well known. Results from a few meta-analyses studies and reviews showed that synergistic interactions tend to be more frequent compared to additive and antagonistic ones. However, most of the studies are individual-based and assess the cumulative effects of a few contaminants individually in laboratory settings together with few climate variables, particularly temperature and pH. Nevertheless, a wide diversity of contaminants have already been individually tested, spanning from metals, persistent organic pollutants and, more recently, emergent pollutants. Population and community based approaches are less frequent but have generated very interesting and more holistic perspectives. Methodological approaches are quite diverse, from laboratory studies to mesocosm and field studies, or based on statistical or modelling tools, each with their own potential and limitations. More holistic comparisons integrating several pressures and their combinations and a multitude of habitats, taxa, life-stages, among others, are needed, as well as insights from meta-analyses and systematic reviews.

AB  - Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require tackling both energy-related and non-energy-related GHG emissions, which can be achieved through the transition to a circular economy (CE). The focus of climate change crisis reversal has been on the energy-related continuum over the years through promoting renewable energy uptake and efficiency in energy use. Clean energy transition and efficiency gains in energy use alone will not be sufficient to achieve net-zero emissions in 2050 without paying attention to non-energy-related CO2 emissions. This study systematically reviews the CE literature across different themes, sectors, approaches, and tools to identify accelerators in transitioning to a CE. The study aims to understand and explore how technology, finance, ecosystem, and behavioral studies in the CE paradigm can be integrated as a decision-making tool for CE transition. The material analysis was carried out by identifying the main characteristics of the literature on CE implementation in the agriculture, industry, energy, water, and tourism sectors. Results of the literature survey are synthesized to engender clarity in the literature and identify research gaps to inform future research. Findings show that many studies focused on technology as an accelerator for CE transition, and more studies are needed regarding the CE ecosystem, financing, and behavioral aspects. Also, results show that CE principles are applied at the micro-, meso-, and macro- (national, regional, and global) levels across sectors with the dominance of the industrial sector. The agriculture, water, and energy sectors are at the initial stages of implementation. Additionally, the use of carbon capture and utilization or storage, conceptualized as a circular carbon economy, needs attention in tackling CE implementation in the energy sector, especially in hydrocarbon-endowed economies. The major implication of these findings is that for CE to contribute to accelerated net-zero emission by 2050, coordinated policies should be promoted to influence the amount of financing available to innovative circular businesses and technologies within an ecosystem that engenders behavioral change towards circularity.

AB  - The dependence of traditional fuel vehicles on petroleum energy has aggravated the energy crisis, while the harmful gas emissions generated during the use of traditional fuel vehicles have aggravated environmental pollution and climate warming. Therefore, it is urgent to alleviate energy consumption and environmental pollution in the transportation sector. The development and promotion of energy-saving and environmentally friendly new energy vehicles has become an important initiative in the world automotive industry. However, there is still a gap between the promotion of new energy vehicles and the public's purchase preference, and understanding and respecting the public's purchase preference can help promote the popularity of new energy vehicles. Based on the core database of the Web of Science, we extracted 1498 papers related to the public's purchase preference and the popularization of new energy vehicles in the past two decades. We adopted a systematic literature review framework to clarify the research trajectory and research hotspots from literature combing, with the aim to reveal the interaction between the popularity of new energy vehicles and the public's purchase preference. In addition, we further refined and summarized the existing major studies in order to provide solution ideas for achieving the transition to new energy vehicles in an effort to promote the green and sustainable development of energy.

AB  - The rapid process of urbanization and climate change have resulted in socio-environmental issues that necessitate viable intervention strategies to create green, sustainable, healthy, and livable built environments. One effective method of achieving this is through the development of pocket parks. Although several studies have explored the benefits and design principles of pocket parks, there is a lack of systematic and quantitative understanding, which could influence the decision-making process for the proper adoption of pocket parks. In view of this knowledge gap, this study employs bibliometric methods and critical review to quantitatively analyze and systematically review 276 papers published in the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1977 and 2023. Firstly, a bibliometric analysis is conducted, providing a comprehensive overview of research on pocket parks. Secondly, a detailed critical review is conducted from three major perspectives: influencing factors, design methods, and benefits of pocket parks. Finally, the research trends and future directions are discussed. The results indicate that (a) pocket park development takes various forms, with a growing number of articles published each year. However, research on this topic is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, with significant knowledge gaps remaining globally. (b) The utilization of pocket parks is affected by various factors, including internal, external physical, and socio-economic factors. The mechanisms of these factors and their interactions demand deeper understanding. (c) There is a need to conduct an in-depth exploration of planning methods for pocket parks, and planning and design methods in different country contexts can be expanded and compared. (d) Further research is needed to compare the benefits of pocket parks in different climatic zones in terms of depth and width. The outcome of this study can contribute to the body of knowledge on pocket parks, foster their wider acceptance, and help urban planners, practitioners, policy makers, and government managers apply them more effectively in resilient and livable cities of the future.

AB  - At present, the enormous environmental pressure caused by the manufacturing industry has promoted the development of the recycling industry. The recycling industry is pivotal for sustainable utilization of regional resources, pollution reduction and environmental protection. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), as a comprehensive analytical tool, plays an important role in the analysis of the cyclical industry from different levels, including regional level, industry level, enterprise level and product/service levels. The product service system, a new production system with high integration and overall optimization of products and services, is conducive to obtaining complete product/service information and management. The LCA based product service systems in the field of circular economy is not only crucial in the life cycle management of the product/service for the enterprise, but also contributes to the comprehensive assessment of the environmental benefits of the recycling enterprise. This paper summarizes and systematic reviews the applications of the LCA and PSS (Product Service System) integration in circular economy from a micro perspective. Based on that, the study identifies the challenges for current researches and propose future research directions to promote the development of LCA in circular economy from the perspective of enterprises.

AB  - Many studies around the globe have documented that the introduction of non-indigenous fish species (NIFS) may pose severe impacts on native biota, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. In Greece, publications on NIFS have increased in recent decades, however review studies of past and current scientific research on freshwater NIFS in the country are currently lacking..he aim of the present study was to: (a) assess the current state of knowledge of freshwater NIFS in Greece based on the existing scientific literature, (b) evaluate well-studied areas of NIFS research, and (c) identify important gaps that may direct national authorities to implement appropriate research, management and conservation actions reversing the negative impacts of NIFS. A systematic literature review on NIFS research within Greek inland waters was performed by applying the PRISMA methodology (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Overall, our initial search resulted in 2,794 published articles, 87 of which met our selection criteria and were thus included for full analysis. Evidently, NIFS failed to attract the interest of ecologists in Greece until the turn of the century, at which point, publications increased at a rapid rate. However, the majority of the studies were mainly monothematic concerning NIFS distribution within freshwater ecosystems of Greece (37%), followed by studies on ecological and biological aspects of NIFS (28%). Studies based on fieldwork and laboratory experiments were by far the most common type of research, followed by studies based on bibliographic data. Despite the fact that almost half of the publications were field observational studies, most of them used only qualitative data (plain presence/absence data). Critical aspects of impact assessment were missing; 84% of the reviewed studies did not provide any concrete evidence of NIFS impacts to native biota. Overall, the focus of the studies was uneven, with important gaps in areas of theoretical and practical importance for policy-relevant detection, control and management of NIFS. Findings may assist researchers in filling scientific gaps identified by our review and guide authorities to define national priorities to prevent and control the spread of NIFS within the country.

AB  - Construction and demolition waste (C&DW) as a direct consequence of rapid urbanization is increasing around the world. C&DW generation has been identified as one of the major issues in the construction industry due to its direct impacts on the environment as well as the efficiency of construction industry. It is estimated that an overall of 35% of C&DW is landfilled globally, therefore, effective C&DW management is crucial in order to minimize detrimental impacts of C&DW for the environment. As the industry cannot continue to practice if the resources on which it depends are depleted, C&DW management needs to be implemented in an effective way. Despite considering many well-developed strategies for C&DW management, the outputs of the implementation of these strategies is far from optimum. The main reason of this inefficiency is due to inadequate understanding of principal factors, which play a vital role in C&DW management. Therefore, the aim of this research is to critically scrutinize the concept of C&DW and its managerial issues in a systematic way to come up with the effective C&DW management. In order to achieve this aim, and based on a systematic review of 97 research papers relevant to effective C&DW management, this research considers two main categories as fundamental factors affecting C&DW management namely, C&DW management hierarchy including reduce, reuse, and recycle strategies, and effective C&DW management contributing factors, including C&DW management from sustainability perspective, C&DW stakeholders' attitudes, C&DW project life cycle, and C&DW management tools.

AB  - Despite the relevance of human resources in the management of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), confusion and theoretical chaos are still evident in the area. This manuscript provides a systematic review of the link between CSR and Human Resource Management (HRM), stressing the main topics along with the evolution and tendencies founded in this field. SciMAT was used to conduct a conceptual science mapping analysis based on co-word bibliographic networks. From 2006 to 2019, 194 documents were retrieved from the Web of Science. Considering the last period (2017-2019), the motor themes (those which are well-developed and relevant for the structure of the research field) were environmental management (including green HRM), sustainable HRM and pro-environmental behaviour. Socially responsible HRM (SR-HRM) was a basic theme (important, although not developed). Perceived organisational support was a specialised theme (well-developed, although less important), and employee commitment was an emerging theme (both weakly developed and marginal). In addition, a review of the measurement tools used in the main topics extracted from the previous analysis was carried out. Our analysis will help inform researchers and practitioners on the future of CSR and HRM and the previous efforts in the creation of measurement instruments.

AB  - Various studies offer insightful perspectives on the potential impact of music-listening on driving performance. These studies, however, present conflicting views on the effect of music as either hindering or enhancing driving performance and advance inconclusive claims regarding how and to what extent specific music parameters affect vehicular performance. In this study, therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies. First, we identified experimental studies that measured the effects of music listening on driving performance through database searches using multiple variants including "car"", "driv*", "'pert"", and "music""; of the 118 publications reviewed, 12 met the inclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis. Second, we coded independent variables i.e., tempo, volume, instrumentation, familiarity, musical style, the music's source, and whether music was selected by the researchers or the drivers and dependent variables i.e., vehicular longitudinal and lateral control, driver reaction time, traffic signal violations, collisions, and driving scores. Third, we ran mixed-effects and random-effects models to identify both general tendencies and more particular trends related to the effect of music-listening on driving performance driving performance is here understood as the combination of vehicle manipulation and road navigation. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, the results of this meta-analysis show that music-listening has a statistically significant detrimental effect on driving performance, specifically for collisions and longitudinal control. In contrast with anecdotal evidence, however, the results of this meta-analysis show a detrimental effect associated with music-listening at soft volumes and no significant difference in driving performance associated with tempo. The study's findings contributed to the development of a process model, and the concluding discussion offers suggestions for future empirical investigations related to music and driving.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural supply chains and markets in Zimbabwe and subsequent effect on livelihoods. The research methodology that was applied is a systematic literature survey anchored on inductive research approach. This article is based on the systematic review of secondary data sources, such as journals, policy reports, as well as reports from national and international organizations. The review involved a predetermined and comprehensive approach of searching, analyzing and synthesizing extant literature on agricultural supply chains. In general, the pandemic has affected the whole supply chain from the food production systems and input supply, the storage and distribution, processing and packaging as well as the retail and marketing aspect. The research showed that the COVID-19 pandemic severely threatens an already critical food security situation arising mainly from the prevailing poor macroeconomic conditions and consecutive years of drought in Zimbabwe. This has led to a higher than previously anticipated food insecure population, especially in urban centers. Over 70% of the workers are self-employed and a vast majority operate in the informal sector. The informally employed represent a significant breadwinner constituency, whose dependents comprise vulnerable sections of the populace. The restrictions on mobility and the closure of borders meant immediate loss of employment and income. The study revisited the previous viruses such as Ebola to extrapolate though marginally, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using secondary sources and the general agriculture supply chain to guide understanding, the findings show that unless measures are put in place to safeguard farmers especially smallholder activities in Zimbabwe, COVID-19 has the potential to reproduce the same catastrophic implications created by Ebola in West Africa countries where peasant food systems where shattered and livelihoods strategies maimed.

AB  - The global spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 pandemic, has had a devastating impact on supply chains. Since the pandemic started, scholars have been researching and publishing their studies on the various supply-chain-related issues raised by COVID-19. However, while the number of articles on this subject has been steadily increasing, due to the absence of any systematic literature reviews, it remains unclear what aspects of this disruption have already been studied and what aspects still need to be investigated. The present study systematically reviews existing research on the COVID-19 pandemic in supply chain disciplines. Through a rigorous and systematic search, we identify 74 relevant articles published on or before 28 September 2020. The synthesis of the findings reveals that four broad themes recur in the published work: namely, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resilience strategies for managing impacts and recovery, the role of technology in implementing resilience strategies, and supply chain sustainability in the light of the pandemic. Alongside the synthesis of the findings, this study describes the methodologies, context, and theories used in each piece of research. Our analysis reveals that there is a lack of empirically designed and theoretically grounded studies in this area; hence, the generalizability of the findings, thus far, is limited. Moreover, the analysis reveals that most studies have focused on supply chains for high-demand essential goods and healthcare products, while low-demand items and SMEs have been largely ignored. We also review the literature on prior epidemic outbreaks and other disruptions in supply chain disciplines. By considering the findings of these articles alongside research on the COVID-19 pandemic, this study offers research questions and directions for further investigation. These directions can guide scholars in designing and conducting impactful research in the field.

AB  - Background and aim: Breastfeeding is an essential source of nutrition for young babies; however, it is challenging for employed mothers to continue breastfeeding with employment, especially if workplace support is minimal or missing. In Pakistan, from 1983 to 2008, the prevalence of breastfeeding at 6 months has decreased from 96% to 31%. In this region, workplace barriers have been reported as one of the reasons that result in early cessation of breastfeeding among working mothers. This paper aims at reviewing global literature to explore workplace interventions that can promote the breastfeeding practices among working mothers in Pakistan.
   Methods: A literature search of peer reviewed databases, including CINHAL (1980-2009), MEDLINE (1980-2009), Pub Med (1980-2009), Springer Link (1980-2008), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (3rd quarter, 2008), was undertaken. Considering the pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria, out of more than 500 literature sources, 50 were shortlisted and reviewed.
   Results: A review of global literature revealed that in order to promote breastfeeding practices among employed mothers, the most powerful workplace interventions include: educating working mothers about management of breastfeeding with employment; enhancing employers' awareness about benefits of breastfeeding accommodation at workplace; arranging physical facilities for lactating mothers (including privacy, childcare facilities, breast pumps, and breast milk storage facilities); providing job-flexibility to working mothers; and initiating mother friendly policies at workplace that support breastfeeding.
   Conclusion: In Pakistani workplace settings, where little attention is paid to sustain breastfeeding practices among working mothers, there is a need to initiate lactation support programmes. These programmes can be made effective by implementing composite interventions at the level of breastfeeding working mothers, employers, and workplace. (C) 2012 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - Contemporary multi-tier supply chains are increasingly international, complex, and challenging for suppliers and focal companies. In addition to this, internal and external stakeholders, regulators, consumers and non-governmental organizations all now require firms to take responsibility for and action towards mitigating unsustainable practices and misconduct in their supply chains. In dealing with this complex supply chain context, quantitative modeling approaches are relevant in their ability to capture the complexity of problems in order to propose effective and sustainable solutions. The main objective of this study is to review selected literature on the effective management of sustainability in supply chains, and its attendant implications for multi-tier supply chain modeling problems. Previously published modeling research that may directly or indirectly provide lessons for multi-tier sustainable supply chains is investigated utilizing the Scopus database. After analyzing the relevant literature, we deliver the following contributions: (a) a systematization and classification of the selected papers; (b) a description of 16 research gaps that remain in the literature and that may be useful in expanding research efforts in this domain; (c) four lessons for both practitioners and managers dealing with sustainability in multi-tier supply chains; (d) an integrative framework which encapsulates key areas of focus to develop multitier sustainable supply chains. Implications for theory and practice are suggested, as well as limitations concerning the scope of this systematic review.

AB  - The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a vision for achieving a sustainable future. Reliable, timely, comprehensive, and consistent data are critical for measuring progress towards, and ultimately achieving, the SDGs. Data from citizen science represent one new source of data that could be used for SDG reporting and monitoring. However, information is still lacking regarding the current and potential contributions of citizen science to the SDG indicator framework. Through a systematic review of the metadata and work plans of the 244 SDG indicators, as well as the identification of past and ongoing citizen science initiatives that could directly or indirectly provide data for these indicators, this paper presents an overview of where citizen science is already contributing and could contribute data to the SDG indicator framework. The results demonstrate that citizen science is "already contributing" to the monitoring of 5 SDG indicators, and that citizen science "could contribute" to 76 indicators, which, together, equates to around 33%. Our analysis also shows that the greatest inputs from citizen science to the SDG framework relate to SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Realizing the full potential of citizen science requires demonstrating its value in the global data ecosystem, building partnerships around citizen science data to accelerate SDG progress, and leveraging investments to enhance its use and impact.

AB  - The wastewater sector accounts for up to 7 and 10% of anthropogenic CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. Nowadays wastewater treatment plants are going through a paradigm shift to approach a net-zero carbon condition. Numerous ongoing measures have taken place to identify the sources of greenhouse gases and minimize the carbon footprint. This paper systematically reviews all known practices leading towards net-zero carbon wastewater treatment. The greenhouse gas emissions from the wastewater sector are identified and carbon footprint quantification tools, such as reliable models and emission factors are compared. The direct process emissions can contribute to over 60% of the carbon footprint in wastewater treatment plants, while around 30% of the carbon footprint is due to energy-related indirect emissions. Therefore, greenhouse gas mitigation via process optimization and energy usage in wastewater treatment plants are comprehensively described. The implantation of novel nitrogen removal processes can reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Other techniques such as source separation systems can potentially allow mitigation of N2O emissions by 60% while avoiding energy-intensive nitrogen fertilizer production. Nutrient recovery methods are another approach which offer negative value for the net carbon footprint. Recovering N2O for energy production is a promising method which can lead to both direct and indirect carbon footprint reductions. Ultimately, to achieve full decarbonization any remaining emissions need to be offset, including carbon footprint of chemicals usage and transportation.

AB  - The public health and economic significance of malaria is enormous, and its control remains a great challenge. Many established malaria control methods are hampered by drug resistance and insecticide-resistant vectors. Malaria control measures built around environmental management are non-toxic, cost-effective, and sustainable. However, there has been no comprehensive review of the literature or meta-analysis examining the effect of these interventions. We therefore did a systematic literature review and identified 40 studies that emphasised environmental management interventions and reported clinical malaria variables as outcome measures. Of these 40 studies, environmental modification (measures aiming to create a permanent or long-lasting effect on land, water, or vegetation to reduce vector habitats-eg, the installation and maintenance of drains) was the central feature in 27 studies, environmental manipulation (methods creating temporary unfavourable conditions for the vector-eg, water or vegetation management) in four, and nine quantified the effect of modifications of human habitation. Most of the studies (n=34, 85%) were implemented before the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign (1955-69), which mainly relied on indoor residual spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In 16 studies that applied environmental modification and in eight studies on modification of human habitation, the risk ratio of malaria was reduced by 88(.)0% (95% CI 81(.)7-92(.)1) and 79(.)5% (95% CI 67(.)4-87(.)2), respectively. We conclude that malaria control programmes that emphasise environmental management are highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Lessons learned from these past successful programmes can inspire sound and sustainable malaria control approaches and strategies.

AB  - Background: Alternatives to postoperative, narcotic pain management following implant-based, postmastectomy breast reconstruction (IBR) must be a focus for plastic surgeons and anesthesiologists, especially with the current opioid epidemic. Paravertebral blocks (PVBs) are a regional technique that has demonstrated efficacy in patients undergoing a variety of breast cancer-related surgeries. However, a specific understanding of PVB's efficacy in pain management in patients who undergo IBR is lacking. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database was conducted to examine PVB administration in mastectomy patients undergoing IBR. Data were abstracted regarding: authors, publication year, study design, patient demographics, tumor laterality, tumor stage, type, and timing of reconstruction. The primary outcome was PVB efficacy, represented as patient-reported pain scores. Secondary outcomes of interest include narcotic consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, antiemetic use, and length of stay. Results: The search resulted in 1,516 unique articles. After title and abstract screening, 29 articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Only 7 studies were included. Of those, 2 studies were randomized control trials and 5 were retrospective cohort studies. Heterogeneity of included studies precluded a meta-analysis. Overall, PVB patients had improved pain control, and less opioid consumption. Conclusion: PVBs are a regional anesthesia technique which may aid in pain management in the breast reconstructive setting. Evidence suggests that PVBs aid in controlling acute postoperative pain, reduce opioid consumption, and improve patient length of stay. However, some conflicting findings demonstrate a need for continued research in this area of pain control.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial use in food-producing animals selects for antimicrobial resistance that can be transmitted to humans via food or other transmission routes. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 ranked the medical importance of antimicrobials used in humans. In late 2017, to preserve the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials for humans, WHO released guidelines on use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals that incorporated the latest WHO rankings.
   Methods: WHO commissioned systematic reviews and literature reviews, and convened a Guideline Development Group (GDG) of external experts free of unacceptable conflicts-of-interest. The GDG assessed the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and formulated recommendations using a structured evidence-to-decision approach that considered the balance of benefits and harms, feasibility, resource implications, and impact on equity. The resulting guidelines were peer-reviewed by an independent External Review Group and approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.
   Results: These guidelines recommend reductions in the overall use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals, including complete restriction of use of antimicrobials for growth promotion and for disease prevention (i.e., in healthy animals considered at risk of infection). These guidelines also recommend that antimicrobials identified as critically important for humans not be used in food-producing animals for treatment or disease control unless susceptibility testing demonstrates the drug to be the only treatment option.
   Conclusions: To preserve the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials, veterinarians, farmers, regulatory agencies, and all other stakeholders are urged to adopt these recommendations and work towards implementation of these guidelines.

AB  - A sustainable transition towards a net zero emission economy is a primary goal of climate change mitigation. Such a transition should involve each socio-technical system, including the transport system. Adopting a multi-level perspective, the present study explores the behaviour of actors within the road passenger transport sector by investigating roadblocks to the shift towards electric mobility. The study focuses specifically on regime actors, i.e. the whole of consumers (car drivers), industry actors (car manufacturers, suppliers), policymakers, and civil society (citizens, workers, trade unions, environmental organisations, NGOs) acting at regime level. Although these actors provide stability to the socio-technical system, they do not always oppose change. Indeed, they can actively support the transition pushing a reform agenda that fits their interests. The reframing of their behaviour becomes therefore essential for the regime change to occur. The analysis involved the systematic literature re-view of studies concerning the road transport regime actors. These included 44 publications related to the Eu-ropean continent in the period 2015-2020. The findings reveal a recent re-orientation of regime actors, with the presence of factors supporting change along with those reinforcing resistance. The firsts include the role of electric vehicles as symbols of social status and innovativeness, their environmentally sound for decarbonising transport, and the possibility for firms to pursue new business opportunities and models. In contrast, the emerged factors of resistance include uncertainty in demand and production scalability, the risk of job losses, the rigid value chain, and the lack of charging stations that makes electric vehicles not suitable in everyday life.

AB  - Different components of global change (e.g., climate change, land use, pollution, and introduced species) continue to alter biodiversity worldwide. As northern regions are still relatively undisturbed and will likely face clear increases in temperature in the near-future, we examined the signs of biodiversity change due to anthropogenic stressors using a systematic review of previous studies. Our aim was to map where, in which way, and owing to which stressor biodiversity in northern regions has changed. We made a systematic literature search covering the years between 2000 and 2015 to obtain a comprehensive selection of recent research. As species richness was clearly the most commonly used indicator of biodiversity, we only concentrated on this aspect of biodiversity. We compared different biological groups, regions, and ecosystems. In the majority of the cases, anthropogenic stressors had decreased species richness, or had no effects on it, while increasing or multiple effects of stressors on species richness were less common. Freshwater ecosystems were most sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, as species richness often decreased owing to these stressors. The effects of land use on richness were covered relatively widely in the selected set of articles, but the effects of other components of global change on species richness require further attention. Despite the fact that pollution was not as commonly studied stressor as land use, it was the most harmful stressor type affecting species richness. Geographically, most studies were located in boreal Canada or Fennoscandia, while no studies were executed in vast circumpolar areas where the temperature rise has been greatest and the projected climate change is likely to be fast. Overall, we could find an alarmingly small set of studies that described the effects of actual anthropogenic stressors in real-life circumstances in northern high latitudes.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementA diversity of values is needed to maximize the effectiveness of conservation planning, including policies and programs. The results of the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) in Montreal, Canada, highlight the importance of a shift towards recognizing multiple ways of knowing in ecology and conservation. This review aims to provide a baseline of what is known about culturally significant plants in the Great Lakes Region of Eastern North America. The results of this research provide insight into the ways in which ecology has been conducted in the past and the importance of changing the way ecology is conducted in the future. Biocultural conservation theory allows for an examination of complex problems using systems thinking and conserving biological and cultural diversity together. In the Great Lakes Region of Eastern North America, wild medicine plants are an important part of what Anishinaabe people understand as Mini bimaadizi, or the good life, and of aki miijim, or traditional food systems. Given the various threats facing wild plant populations and continued global change, this review aims to investigate what is known about the pollination and breeding systems of culturally significant plants in the Great Lakes Region. The overall goal is to determine what proportion of these plants have had basic ecological studies done and the degree to which culturally significant plants in this region rely on insect pollination. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on breeding systems and pollination of culturally significant plants. Half of all the culturally significant plants included lacked specific information related to reproduction. Most plants that have been studied relied on outcrossing, and the most commonly reported pollinators were in the Apidae family. With the complex interactions between plants and pollinators and many insect pollinators experiencing population declines, it is important to determine the dependence of culturally significant plants on animal pollination. These findings will be relevant to conservation planning and policy in the future.

AB  - Evidence for the proposed Anthropocene epoch in fluvial geomorphology hinges on the influence of human activities relative to natural forcing. However, research on cause-effect understanding in river channel evolution has rarely focused on the cumulative impact of multiple drivers for change, limiting insights. Systematic review of 25 recent studies professing to explain reach-scale channel responses to cumulative impacts of human activities and natural forcing over the recent past (ca. 1880-2005) reveals some consistencies in spatio-temporal response across various catchment sizes (median 3000 km(2)) in mostly industrialized nations. Common drivers for change include changing flood and flow regimes, dam construction, changing land uses and forest cover, bank protection and instream aggregate mining. Recent channel evolution has predominantly involved narrowing, incision and terrace development, reduced bed sediment storage, lower activity rates and simplified channel geometries. Rates of channel change frequently peaked 1955-1990, providing some support for the Anthropocene 'Great Acceleration'. Evidence here suggests that many river systems are now in morphologically-novel configurations, coinciding temporally with dramatic recent declines in global freshwater aquatic biodiversity. Sustainable approaches to freshwater management must acknowledge these configurations, placing emphasis on process based approaches to river ecosystem health in which sediment cascades are reconceived to reflect altered longitudinal and lateral connectivity. However, the reviewed studies are driven largely by expert judgment, depicting cause-effect associations through summary conceptual models based on spatial proximity and temporal synchronicity, providing insufficient scientific proof for the Anthropocene based on the 'overwhelming' impact of human factors. More conclusive cause-effect statements will require hypothetic-deductive approaches, explicit functional criteria and best-practice environmental model building. Geomorphologists should now move beyond the 'phase of discovery' and develop rigorous proofs for cause-effect relationships of cumulative impact; this may be enhanced by developing an avowedly 'Anthropocene' perspective in which rivers are viewed critically as socio-biophysical systems co-evolving with human activity.

AB  - Carbon emissions from land use change are the leading causes of the greenhouse effect. Exploration of the progress and hotspots of research on land-use carbon emissions (LUCE) is crucial for mitigating global climate warming. However, a comprehensive and systematic review of LUCE research from a global perspective is still lacking. We used the WoS Core Collection Database to analyze the current status of research on LUCE from a global perspective with the aid of a bibliometrix tool, aiming to reveal research hotspots and future development trends. We found that (1) the process of LUCE research has gone through a nascent exploration stage (1992-2001), a problem-focused stage (2002-2011), and a prosperous development stage (2012-2022) under different policy orientations. European and North American countries prioritize LUCE research more than others. (2) Overseas research hotspots mainly focus on the climate effects of land-use change, the impact of deforestation and fire on carbon stocks, the impact of soil organic carbon stocks on climate change and biodiversity, and agricultural carbon emissions. Research hotspots in China mainly focus on the study of the influencing factors of land-use carbon emissions, the path to achieving the dual carbon goal, and the transition to a low carbon economy. (3) Research frontiers show that China mainly researches low-carbon land use intensification in the context of a "dual carbon" strategy; carbon emission reduction based on energy transition; and the multi-dimensional, dynamic, and accurate tracking and monitoring of land-use carbon emission systems using remote sensing satellite data. Other countries have shifted from measuring historical land-use carbon emissions, deforestation, degradation and fire carbon emissions to biomass combustion and global warming mitigation research. This study enhances the depth and breadth of LUCE research, which can provide a theoretical foundation and scientific reference for subsequent research on LUCE.

AB  - Food is an important determinant of health, featuring prominently in the Sustainable Development Goals. The term "big data" is seldom used in relation to food, partly because food data are scattered across different sectors. The increasing availability of food-related data presents an opportunity to glean new insights on food and food systems. These insights may enhance the quality of products and services and improve decision-making on optimizing food availability, all to the end of producing better health. Yet, knowledge gaps remain about the unique opportunities and challenges linked to big data on food and their use in decision-making. This scoping review explored the available literature linking food with big data and decision-making, using the following research question: What is the current literature on data about food, and how are these data used in decision-making? We searched PubMed until 29 February 2020 and Embase, Web of Sciences, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until 8 March 2020. We included studies written in English and conducted narrative analyses to identify relevant themes from included studies. Sixteen studies fulfilled our eligibility criteria, including big data analyses, modelling studies, and reviews. These studies described the added value of using big data and how evidence from big data had or can be used for decision-making, as well as challenges and opportunities for such use. The majority of the included studies examined the link between food and big data, while hypothesizing of how these insights could inform decision-making, including policies, interventions, programs, and financing. There were only two examples wherein big data on food informed decision-making directly. The review highlights several false dichotomies in how the subject is approached in the literature and the importance of context, both between and within countries, in shaping the availability and types of data that can be used as meaningful evidence to inform decision-making. This review shows the paucity of research around the intersection of food, big data, and decision-making, as well as the potential in using big data on food systems to the end of informing decisions to improve the health of populations. Future research and decision-making around health systems can benefit from examining the full spectrum of perspectives on the subject. Future research and decision-making around health systems can also employ the steadfast embrace of technology, which will potentially reduce disparities in big data availability, to the end of improving the health of populations.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems support human well-being by delivering a wide range of ecosystem services. Particularly important is the significant role they play in food provisioning by supporting fisheries worldwide. Despite their socio-economic importance, it is only recently when they have been considered as important social-ecological systems worldwide. Research focused on the interactions between seagrasses and human activities have been understudied and never addressed from a global approach, even though this knowledge is essential to create relevant policy and management plans, and to promote governance systems, which consider fishers' needs and rights. Thus, we carried out a global systematic review on trade-offs and/or synergies between seagrasses and fishing activities, aiming to analyse the current state of the art on these interactions, to identify potential gaps in knowledge, and to pinpoint key research priorities. We found a total of 94 publications assessing the relationship between seagrass ecosystems and fisheries, which have tripled between 2001-2021, being most of them empirical studies (90%) with ecological scope (a total of 68). Socioeconomic studies (3%) on the subject were identified as a knowledge gap. Most studies (72%) were carried out in northern hemisphere countries, with an underrepresentation of studies in tropical regions. The studies reporting trade-off (a total of 69) interactions almost tripled those reporting synergies (a total of 31) between seagrass ecosystems and fisheries. Mechanical damage to seagrasses by fishing gear is the main source (51%) of trade-offs, followed by overfishing (28%), while aquaculture cages' emissions (20%) are also a relevant source of trade-offs. Seafood market demand and conflicts of use were the main drivers for trade-offs. When assessing synergistic interactions, most studies (27 out of 31) reported a larger abundance or recruitment of species with commercial interest mediated by seagrass habitat provision. Globally, seagrass ecosystems are mainly affected by industrial and small-scale fisheries, including aquaculture and shellfisheries, and to a lesser extent, by recreational fisheries. Fisheries management system is not specified in more than half (53) of the reviewed publications, which represents a key knowledge gap with implications for sustainable management. Nevertheless, we document a fast increase in studies covering fishery-seagrass interactions, which, if accompanied by better reporting of the nature of the interactions and the socio-economic context of the fishery, would help improve the sustainable management of both systems.

AB  - Uvaria chamae P. Beauv is known as a key shrub species providing several goods and services for sustaining livelihoods in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its great medicinal importance for local communities, little is known about its conservation status and sustainable management strategies regarding the current overex-ploitation of the species' fruits through traditional agroforestry systems. Here, we addressed a global system-atic review of the current state of knowledge on several aspects of research of U. chamae for setting further breeding programmes and conservation initiatives. A total of 744 publications were identified based on the extensive bibliometric review of its sustainable management and conservation status over the last three dec-ades (1991-2021) through existing online databases. Only 257 publications were finally included in the cur-rent review after deep scrutinization which were in line with several aspects of the conservation ecology and management of U. chamae in Africa. All retained papers came globally from the five sub-regions, and particu-larly 13 countries in Africa. Most of them were recorded in West Africa (n = 245) compared to the other sub-regions where few studies exist on this intensively harvested shrub species. Approximately 89% of the retained publications came from five of West African countries including Nigeria (n = 151), Benin (n = 30), Cote d'Ivoire (n = 18), Guinea (n = 16), and Togo (n = 14). In-depth bibliometric analysis revealed critical knowledge gaps on U. chamae in terms of its geographic distribution; conservation status; tree growth, pro-ductivity and propagation; morphological diversity; molecular genetic diversity; reproductive biology; eco-physiological performances; socio-economic importance; biochemical analysis; and structural characterization. The current review paves the way for developing further long-term management programs of U. chamae in Africa.(c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study, a current systematic literature review, is to synthesize the extant literature on consumers' adoption of artificial intelligence and robotics (AIR) in the context of the hospitality and tourism sector (HATS) to gain a comprehensive understanding of it. This study also outlines insights for academia, practitioners, AI marketers, developers, designers and policymakers. Design/methodology/approach This study used a content analysis approach to conduct a systematic literature review for the period of 10 years (2011-2020) of the various published studies themed around consumer's adoption of AIR in HATS. Findings The synthesis draws upon various factors affecting the adoption of AIR, such as individual factors, service factors, technical and performance factors, social and cultural factors and infrastructural factors. Additionally, the authors identified four major barriers, namely, psychological, social, financial, technical and functional that hinder the consumer's adoption of artificial intelligence and robots in the hospitality and tourism industry. Originality/value To the best of the author's/authors' knowledge, this study is a first attempt to synthesize the factors that drive consumers' adoption of artificial intelligence and robots in the hospitality and tourism industry. The present work also advances the tourism and consumer behavior literature by offering an integrated antecedent-outcome framework. Visual abstract Figure 2 The objective of the current systematic literature review is to synthesize the extant literature on consumer's adoption of artificial intelligence and robotics (AIR) in the context of the hospitality and tourism sector (HATS) to gain a comprehensive understanding of it. For that purpose, authors conducted content analysis of extant literature on consumer's adoption of AIR in HATS from 2011 to 2020. Authors presented an integrated antecedent outcome framework of the factors that drive consumer's adoption of artificial intelligence and robots in the hospitality and tourism industry.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise is a globally widespread sensory pollutant, recognized as having potentially adverse effects on function, demography, and physiology in wild animals. Human population growth and associated changes in urbanization, transportation, and resource extraction all contribute to anthropogenic noise and are predicted to increase in the coming decades. Wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise is expected to rise correspondingly. Data collected through field research are uniquely important in advancing understanding of the real-world repercussions of human activity on wildlife. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of literature published from 2008 to 2018 that reported on field investigations of anthropogenic noise impacts. We evaluated publication metrics (e.g., publication rates and journal type), geographical distribution of studies, study subject, and methods used. Research activity increased markedly over the assessment period. However, there was a pronounced geographical bias in research, with most being conducted in North America or Europe, and a notable focus on terrestrial environments. Fewer than one-fifth of terrestrial studies were located in rural areas likely to experience urbanization by 2030, meaning data on ecosystems most likely to be affected by future changes are not being gathered. There was also bias in the taxonomic groups investigated. Most research was conducted on birds and aquatic mammals, whereas terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates received limited attention. Almost all terrestrial studies examined diurnal species, despite evidence that nocturnality is the prevailing animal activity pattern. Nearly half the studies investigated effects of road or urban noise; the bulk of research was restricted to functional, rather than physiological or demographic consequences. Few experimental studies addressed repercussions of long-term exposure to anthropogenic noise or long-term postexposure effects, and multiple noise types or levels were rarely compared. Tackling these knowledge gaps will be vital for successful management of the effects of increasing wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise.

AB  - Introduction: Tobacco use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is double the general population. Limited evidence suggests high smoking rates among intersex people. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people are a priority population in Australian health policy, particularly mental health and aging. Despite associations between smoking and noncommunicable diseases relevant to aging and mental health, LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions in Australia have been limited to people living with HIV. Applying existing interventions to marginalized populations without modification and evaluation may fail and exacerbate inequities.
   Aims: To assess outcomes and characterize the populations served, cultural modifications, and behavior change techniques (BCTs) of interventions to reduce LGBTI smoking.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, six additional databases, and contacted authors to retrieve published and unpublished program evaluations.
   Results: We retrieved 19 studies (3663 participants). None used control groups. Overall quit rate was 61.0% at the end of interventions and stabilized at 38.6% at 3-6 months. All studies included gay men, 13 included lesbians, 13 "LGBT," 12 bisexual people, five transgender people, and none included intersex people. Transgender people comprised 3% of participants. Of programs open to women, 27.8% of participants were women. Cultural modifications were used by 17 (89.5%) studies, commonly meeting in LGBT spaces, discussing social justice, and discussing LGBT-specific triggers. Common BCTs included providing normative information, boosting motivation/self-efficacy, relapse prevention, social support, action planning, and discussing consequences.
   Conclusions: Quit rates were high; using control groups would improve evaluation. Existing programs may fail to reach groups other than gay men.
   Implications: This review examines the evidence for LGBTI-targeted smoking cessation interventions. Populations within LGBTI are not proportionally represented in smoking cessation research, and no study addressed intersex smoking. Overall, LGBT-targeted interventions appear to be effective, and simply having an LGBT-specific group may be more effective than groups for the general population. More rigorous research is necessary to draw firm conclusions. Our study space analysis provides suggestions for areas of more targeted research on mechanisms underlying these complex interventions' success.

AB  - Prescribed fires are one of the most effective tools to reduce the risk of wildfires but this treatment may negatively affect the hydrological and erosive response of soil, with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion. Many studies have been published on this matter but there is no consensus in the literature on the magnitude and duration of these effects since the relevant hydrological conditions are site-specific. Moreover, the relationship between post-fire hydrology and its main environmental drivers has been little explored. This study has carried out a bibliographic review and a meta-analysis of the changes resulting from prescribed fire applications (water infiltration, soil water repellency (SWR), surface runoff and soil erosion) using a database of 85 case studies from 41 academic papers that have been published over the last 23 years. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post-fire ground cover, and vegetation type on those changes have also been statistically explored. The bibliographic review has revealed that previous case studies have not been equally distributed across the globe but concentrated in only a few countries, mainly the United States and Spain. The meta-analysis has revealed that (i) water infiltration generally decreases and SWR appears with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion immediately after the prescribed fire, while the pre-fire values progressively recover over time; (ii) the window of disturbance in burned soils may last a few months (with some exceptions); (iii) annual precipitation and soil slope significantly influence water infiltration and surface runoff, but not soil erosion, in both the short-term and medium-term; (iv) moderate-to-high levels of soil burn severity severely enhance surface runoff and soil erosion, and noticeably reduce water infiltration in the short-term; (v) the level of ground cover burning is important for reducing the runoff rates, but it plays a minor role in water infiltration and soil erosion rates;and (vi) the prescribed fire applied in spring results in lower increases in short-term runoff and erosion, while fire applications in summer and in shrublands produce the highest increases in soil loss. The following practical recommendations arise from this study: (i) research should be better distributed across all environmental contexts on a global scale; (ii) post-fire management actions should be immediately implemented after the prescribed fire application; (iii) prescribed fire should be carried out in spring and the soil burn severity should be kept low during burning; (iv) the monitoring studies should be prolonged at least for some years (more than two or three) after prescribed fire; (iv) the catchment-scale investigations, although more difficult and expensive, should be encouraged (avoiding, however, areas to sparsely burnt in the context of the whole catchment); (v) the monitored variables should also include the most important physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, the cover and structure of regenerating vegetation, as well as the water quality parameters; (vi) the effects of repeated applications of prescribed fire should be experimentally assessed; and (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurements and analytical methods in experimental activities should be set up.
   These indications support the use of land managers in the monitoring of the hydrological impacts of the prescribed fire and in the choice of sites where post-fire management actions must be implemented. The last recommendation of this study is the creation of an experimental database supporting the bibliographic review and the meta-analysis, which is made available to other researchers and land managers, to create a public, easily-accessible and comprehensive tool for future research needs and professional use.

AB  - Purpose In a quest to meet increasing pressure to incorporate environmental and sustainability factors due to the legislations and growing public awareness, companies are rethinking of strategizing their supply chain network to take control of the reverse flow of products as well. This growing interest has also led to tremendous growth in publications occurring in several reputed journals in the last few years. In this context, the purpose of this article is to perform a systematic literature survey of recent and state-of-the-art papers in order to draw insights and highlight the future directions. Design/methodology/approach This paper has selected and reviewed 204 papers published from the year 2002-2017. The papers were collected from the web of science and Google scholar database which have the DOI number. The selected papers were then categorized into main five core areas of RSC management namely reverse supply chain (RSC), Reverse Logistics (RL), Remanufacturing, Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) and Product Recovery Systems (PRS) and then analyzed with great detail. Finally, the research gaps that were identified from the study have been highlighted for future research opportunities. Findings This paper would serve as a roadmap to the managers who wish to align their forward and reverse supply chains for overall growth and development. It provides an in-depth knowledge on RSC to the researchers working in this domain. The scholars would be able to identify the areas of RSC which have been already addressed and the areas which remain unaddressed. Originality/value This paper presents a systematic literature survey of state-of-the-art papers that was published in the reputed journal in the area of RSC. Total 204 numbers of papers which were published in the reputed journals between 2002 and 2017 are reviewed, categorized and analysed to draw the opportunities and future research direction in the area of RSC.

AB  - Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a well researched candidate gene for schizophrenia and affective disorders with a range of functions relating to neurodevelopment. Several human brain imaging studies investigating correlations between common and rare variants in DISC1 and brain structure and function have shown conflicting results. A meta-analysis of case/control data showed no association between schizophrenia and any common SNP in DISC1. Therefore it is timely to review the literature to plan the direction of future studies. Twenty-two human brain imaging studies have examined the influence of DISC1 variants in health, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression. The most studied common SNPs are Ser704Cys (rs821616) and Leu607Phe (rs6675281). Some imaging-genomic studies report effects on frontal, temporal and hippocampal structural indices in health and illness and a volumetric longitudinal study supports a putative role for these common SNPs in neurodevelopment. Callosal agenesis is described in association with rare deletions at 1q42 which include DISC1 and rare sequence variants at DISC1 itself. DISC1 interactions with translin-associated factor X (TRAX) and neuregulin have been shown to influence several regional volumes. In the first study involving neonates, a role for Ser704Cys (rs821616) has been highlighted in prenatal brain development with large clusters of reduced grey matter reported in the frontal lobes.
   Functional MRI studies examining associations between Ser704Cys (rs821616) and Leu607Phe (rs6675281) with prefrontal and hippocampal activation have also given inconsistent results. Prefrontal function was reported to be associated with interaction between DISC1 and CITRON (CIT) in health. Preliminary magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor data support the influence of Ser704Cys (rs821616) status on grey and white matter integrity. The glutamate system remains uninvestigated.
   Associations between rare sequence variants and structural changes in brain regions including the corpus callosum and effects of gene-gene interactions on brain structure and function are promising areas for future study. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The adoption of healthy diets with low environmental impact has been widely promoted as an important climate change mitigation strategy. Typically, these diets are high in plant-sourced and low in animal-sourced and processed foods. Despite the fact that their environmental impacts vary, they are often referred to as 'sustainable diets'. Here we systematically review the available published evidence on the effect of 'sustainable diets' on environmental footprints and human health. Eight databases (OvidSP-Medline, OvidSP-Embase, EBSCO-GreenFILE, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, OvidSP-CAB-s, OvidSP-AGRIS, and OvidSP-Global Health) were searched to identify literature (published 1999-2019) reporting health effects and environmental footprints of 'sustainable diets'. Available evidence was mapped and pooled analysis was conducted by unique combinations of diet pattern, health and environmental outcome. Eighteen studies (412 measurements) met our inclusion criteria, distinguishing twelve non-mutually exclusive sustainable diet patterns, six environmental outcomes, and seven health outcomes. In 87% of measurements (n = 151) positive health outcomes were reported from 'sustainable diets' (average relative health improvement: 4.09% [95% CI -0.10-8.29]) when comparing 'sustainable diets' to current/baseline consumption patterns. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 'sustainable diets' were on average 25.8%[95%CI -27.0 to -14.6] lower than current/baseline consumption patterns, with vegan diets reporting the largest reduction in GHG-emissions (-70.3% [95% CI: -90.2 to -50.4]), however, water use was frequently reported to be higher than current/baseline diets. Multiple benefits for both health and the environment were reported in the majority (n = 315[76%]) of measurements. We identified consistent evidence of both positive health effects and reduced environmental footprints accruing from 'sustainable diets'. The notable exception of increased water use associated with 'sustainable diets' identifies that co-benefits are not universal and some trade-offs are likely. When carefully designed, evidence-based, and adapted to contextual factors, dietary change could play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation, sustainable food systems, and future population health.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to have dramatic effects on Arctic freshwater ecosystems through changes to the abiotic template that are expected to influence biodiversity. Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers. This special issue includes regional patterns for selected groups of organisms in Arctic rivers and lakes of northern Europe, Russia, and North America. Circumpolar assessments for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, plankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish demonstrate how climate change and associated environmental drivers affect freshwater biodiversity. Also included are papers on spatial and temporal trends in water chemistry across the circumpolar region, and a systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge that demonstrates its potential to support assessment and conservation of Arctic freshwaters. This special issue includes the first circumpolar assessment of trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity and provides important baseline information for future assessments and studies. It represents the largest compilation and assessment of Arctic freshwater biodiversity data to date and strives to provide a holistic view of ongoing change in these ecosystems to support future monitoring efforts. By identifying gaps in monitoring data across the circumpolar region, as well as identifying best practices for monitoring and assessment, this special issue presents an important resource for researchers, policy makers, and Indigenous and local communities that can support future assessments of ecosystem change.

AB  - Aims
   In the UK, the NHS generates an estimated 25 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (4% to 5% of the nation's total carbon emissions) and produces over 500,000 tonnes of waste annually. There is limited evidence demonstrating the principles of sustainability and its benefits within orthopaedic surgery. The primary aim of this study was to analyze the environmental impact of orthopaedic surgery and the environmentally sustainable initiatives undertaken to address this. The secondary aim of this study was to describe the barriers to making sustainable changes within orthopaedic surgery.
   Methods
   A literature search was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines through EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed libraries using two domains of terms: "orthopaedic surgery" and "environmental sustainability".
   Results
   A total of 13 studies were included in the final analysis. All papers studied the environmental impact of orthopaedic surgery in one of three areas: waste management, resource consumption, and carbon emissions. Waste segregation was a prevalent issue and described by nine studies, with up to 74.4% of hazardous waste being generated. Of this, six studies reported recycling waste and up to 43.9% of waste per procedure was recyclable. Large joint arthroplasties generated the highest amount of recyclable waste per procedure. Three studies investigated carbon emissions from intraoperative consumables, sterilization methods, and through the use of telemedicine. One study investigated water wastage and demonstrated that simple changes to practice can reduce water consumption by up to 63%. The two most common barriers to implementing environmentally sustainable changes identified across the studies was a lack of appropriate infrastructure and lack of education and training.
   Conclusion
   Environmental sustainability in orthopaedic surgery is a growing area with a wide potential for meaningful change. Further research to cumulatively study the carbon footprint of orthopaedic surgery and the wider impact of environmentally sustainable changes is necessary.

AB  - Higher Education Institutions (HEI) or universities, as organisations engaged in education, research and community services, play an important role in promoting sustainable development. Therefore, they are increasingly linked to the initiative of calculating their carbon footprint (CF), which is a tool to assess sustainability from the perspective of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic review of the current situation of CF assessment in academic institutions by analysing different key elements, such as the time period, methodologies and practises, calculation tools, emission sources, emission factors and reduction plans. The review protocol considered articles published until March 2021. Of the articles reviewed, 35 are aimed specifically at calculating the CF of HEI, while the remaining articles consist of review, activity-specific CF assessment or GHG emission reduction articles. Clear differences have been identified when results are compared for the normalised CF (average of 2.67 t CO(2)e/student, ranging from 0.06 to 10.94) or the percentage of carbon offsetting, only considered in 14% of the studies and ranging from 0.09 to 18%. The main reason for this is the lack of standardisation as regards the time metric (year, semester), functional unit (student, employee, area) and data collection boundary (scope 1, 2, 3), the emissions sources and emission factors, mainly for scope 3 (water consumption and treatment, waste treatment, office, ICT and laboratory consumables, commuting and travel, construction materials, canteens, etc.), and the inclusion or not of the effect of carbon offset projects to offset the CF (aim of the project and absorption sources and factors). However, despite the differences, a reduction over time is clearly observed. Therefore, CF in HEI requires further improvements and solutions to a number of challenges, including the definition of representative emission sources, the creation of a robust emission factor database and the development of tools/methodologies that cover all the needs of this type of organisation.

AB  - A clear model of professional development (PD) has the potential to enhance educational and training programs and promote effective, competent, and ethical practice. Scholars have explored facets of the PD of sport psychology practitioners (SPPs) using theoretical frameworks borrowed from counseling psychology. Yet, given the emergence of a sport-specific body of work on this topic, it appears timely to take stock of existing context-specific knowledge. In the present study, we aimed to systematically review the extant literature focused on SPP's PD to identify specific characteristics and organize this knowledge in an accessible and structured manner in the form of a process model of PD. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified 1147 research records in the databases SportDiscuss, PsychArticles, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and PubMed. We subsequently screened and assessed the records for eligibility (i.e., empirical studies published in English that focus on developmental characteristics of SPPs, including a clear developmental stage) reducing the sample of articles that fitted our inclusion criteria to 34 qualitative manuscripts. Finally, we critically explored these manuscripts by engaging in a reflexive thematic analysis and created four developmental phases (i.e., introduction, exploration, solidification, and fulfillment). SPPs' transition through these phases is seemingly facilitated by four processes (i.e., reflection, supervision, connections and networking with peers, and learning by doing), which also support the completion of the tasks associated with nine developmental elements (i.e., purpose, confidence and anxiety, focus, aware-ness, adaptability, independence, philosophy/congruence, professional identity, and the individual). We present the interaction of these developmental phases, elements, and processes in the form of a sport psychology-specific process model of PD. We discuss the implications of this model and its potential contribution to future research, supervision, and training programs. Yet, we also acknowledge how a focus on Anglophone and Western cultural contexts and a lack of methodological transparency are limitations of the extant literature.

AB  - A deep understanding of school travel mode can help policymaking related to the optimization of the school travel structure, alleviating urban traffic congestion due to the increasingly prominent phenomenon of urban sprawl. However, existing studies in this field are based on a specific research perspective, and comprehensive reviews are rather limited. Therefore, this study aims to provide an in-depth, systematic review of school travel by using bibliometric analysis. Firstly, based on the Web of Science, TRID, ScienceDirect, and MEDLINE databases, 457 studies about school travel are selected from between 1996 and 2021. Secondly, utilizing bibliometric analysis, the research progress is summarized with emphasis on the annual performance of the literature, publication status of a country or region, literature source institutions, keywords of the literature, and co-citation network analysis. The research results show that (1) the United States, Canada, and Australia rank top in the number of studies on school travel, and they also have high citation frequency and connection strength. (2) This study collects studies published in 34 journal publications, and the "Journal of Transport & Health" is the main source for publishing research. (3) The choice of school travel mode is significantly affected by individual characteristics, family conditions, and social status. The built environment and parental factors play a leading role in students' active travel to school, and independent mobility and active transport contribute to students' healthy development. However, policy planning is necessary to further improve the transportation infrastructure sustainability and school route safety. (4) Finally, several promising directions and potential limitations are discussed for developing countries based on the research progress in developed economies.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders are likely to be elevated in the Libyan population during the post-conflict period. We estimated cases of severe PTSD and depression and related health service requirements using modelling from existing epidemiological data and current recommended mental health service targets in low and middle income countries (LMIC's).
   Methods: Post-conflict prevalence estimates were derived from models based on a previously conducted systematic review and meta-regression analysis of mental health among populations living in conflict. Political terror ratings and intensity of exposure to traumatic events were used in predictive models. Prevalence of severe cases was applied to chosen populations along with uncertainty ranges. Six populations deemed to be affected by the conflict were chosen for modelling: Misrata (population of 444,812), Benghazi (pop. 674,094), Zintan (pop. 40,000), displaced people within Tripoli/Zlitan (pop. 49,000), displaced people within Misrata (pop. 25,000) and Ras Jdir camps (pop. 3,700). Proposed targets for service coverage, resource utilisation and full-time equivalent staffing for management of severe cases of major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are based on a published model for LMIC's.
   Findings: Severe PTSD prevalence in populations exposed to a high level of political terror and traumatic events was estimated at 12.4% (95% CI 8.5-16.7) and was 19.8% (95% CI 14.0-26.3) for severe depression. Across all six populations (total population 1,236,600), the conflict could be associated with 123,200 (71,600-182,400) cases of severe PTSD and 228,100 (134,000-344,200) cases of severe depression; 50% of PTSD cases were estimated to co-occur with severe depression. Based upon service coverage targets, approximately 154 full-time equivalent staff would be required to respond to these cases sufficiently which is substantially below the current level of resource estimates for these regions.
   Discussion: This is the first attempt to predict the mental health burden and consequent service response needs of such a conflict, and is crucially timed for Libya.

AB  - Purpose: Vehicle-pedestrian conflicts are common at road intersections when traffic lights change. However, the impact of traffic light on transportation safety and efficiency remains poorly understood.
   Methods: A two-stage study was used to survey the proportion of intersections with conflicting traffic lights and the related transportation efficiency and safety were evaluated as well. First, a cross-sectional study estimated the proportion of signalized intersections with conflicting left-turning vehicle-pedestrian traffic lights in Changsha city, China. Second, a natural experiment compared transportation efficiency and safety between intersections with and without conflicting left-turning vehicle-pedestrian traffic lights. Risky conflicts, where motor vehicles violated laws and failed to yield to pedestrians in crosswalk were used as a surrogate for transportation safety. The number of motor vehicles and pedestrians passing through the intersections per second and per meter were used to estimate transportation efficiency. Data were collected and analyzed in 2015 (from March to December). A search of online news from domestic media sources was also conducted to collect pedestrian injury data occurring at the intersections.
   Results: About one-fourth (57/216) intersections had conflicting left-turning traffic lights (95% CI: 20.5%, 32.3%). Risky vehicle-pedestrian conflicts were more frequently observed at intersections with conflicting lights compared to those without (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 3.13; pedestrians: IRR = 4.02), after adjusting for type of day (weekday vs. weekend), the time period of observation, and motor vehicles traffic flow. Intersections without conflicting vehicle-pedestrian traffic lights had similar transportation efficiency to those with conflicting lights after controlling for covariates (p > 0.05). The systematic review of news media reports yielded 10 left-turning vehicle-pedestrian crash events between 2011 and 2017, involving 11 moderate or severe pedestrian injuries and 3 fatal pedestrian injuries.
   Conclusion: Over one-fourth of road intersections in Changsha city, China have conflicting left-turning traffic lights. Conflicting traffic lights cannot improve transportation efficiency, but increase risky conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. (C) 2019 Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - In recent decades, many cities have launched low-carbon pilot schemes to explore feasible local policies and actions that can be replicated on a larger scale to reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. This synthesis analysis reviews the global literature to analyse the interplay of prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods of low-carbon urban experiments. Before 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were regarded as a sub-branch of sustainable development, and prescriptive visions were influenced by sustainability. Low-carbon urban experiments were used as an urban planning tool, and such urban planning concepts impacted the practical response and evaluation methods. After 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were influenced by many more disciplines. Planning still occupies the largest proportion of low-carbon practices, but more advanced technologies - in energy and other fields - have also been adopted and influence the evolution of low-carbon urban experiments. We find several driving factors, including political events and developments, technology change, and contributions from various disciplines including academic research. As carbon neutrality is the long-term target of many nations, achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions through prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods in urban experiments demands further investigation, especially in developing countries.Key policy insightsLow-carbon initiatives on a small scale are frequently practiced by local and national governments, which has reshaped the low-carbon agenda worldwide.Low-carbon development also demands efforts and commitment on the part of local urban governments to promote low-carbon development in its multiple dimensions.Policymakers at different levels of government and governance should focus on how to build on policy instruments in experimental pilots to take action at broader scales.Policymakers also need to adopt relevant indicators from social science in evaluation methods to reflect social sustainability and inclusiveness concerns in the evaluation of low-carbon urban development.

AB  - Objectives: To review the literature on different models of clinical governance and to explore their relevance to Australian primary health care, and their potential contributions on quality and safety.
   Data sources: 25 electronic databases, scanning reference lists of articles and consultation with experts in the field. We searched publications in English after 1999, but a search of the German language literature for a specific model type was also undertaken. The grey literature was explored through a hand search of the medical trade press and websites of relevant national and international clearing houses and professional or industry bodies. 11 software packages commonly used in Australian general practice were reviewed for any potential contribution to clinical governance.
   Study selection: 19 high-quality studies that assessed outcomes were included.
   Data extraction: All abstracts were screened by one researcher, and 10% were screened by a second researcher to crosscheck screening quality. Studies were reviewed and coded by four reviewers, with all studies being rated using standard critical appraisal tools such as the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. Two researchers reviewed the Australian general practice software. Interviews were conducted with 16 informants representing service, regional primary health care, national and international perspectives.
   Data synthesis: Most evidence supports governance models which use targeted, peerled feedback on the clinician's own practice. Strategies most used in clinical governance models were audit, performance against indicators, and peer-led reflection on evidence or performance.
   Conclusions: The evidence base for clinical governance is fragmented, and focuses mainly on process rather than outcomes. Few publications address models that enhance safety, efficiency, sustainability and the economics of primary health care. Locally relevant clinical indicators, the use of computerised medical record systems, regional primary health care organisations that have the capacity to support the uptake of clinical governance at the practice level, and learning from the Aboriginal community-controlled sector will help integrate clinical governance into primary care.

AB  - Urban areas represent a spectrum that goes from being safe habitats for biodiversity (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, without costs to fitness) to being ecological traps (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, but with costs to fitness). Given the imminent urban expansion, it is valuable to assess how biodiversity is responding to urbanization and thus generate timely conservation strategies. We systematically review the urban ecology literature to analyze how much do we know about the role of urban areas as ecological traps. Using a formal meta-analytical approach, we test whether urban areas are functioning as ecological traps or as safe habitats for different taxonomic groups. We generated a data set of 646 effect sizes of different measures of habitat preferences and fitness from 38 papers published between 1985 and 2020. The data set covered 15 countries and 47 urban areas from four continents, including 29 animal species. Studies from North America and Europe were best represented, and birds were the most studied taxa. Overall, the meta-analysis suggests that urbanized habitats are functioning more as safe sites than as ecological traps, mainly for certain species with characteristics that have allowed them to adapt well to urban areas. That is, many of the studied species prefer more urbanized habitats over other less urbanized sites, and their fitness is not modified, or it is even increased. However, there was high heterogeneity among studies. We also performed meta-regressions to identify variables accounting for this heterogeneity across studies and we demonstrate that outcomes may depend on methodological aspects of studies, such as study design or the approach used to measure habitat preference and fitness. More research is needed for poorly studied regions and on a wider range of species before generalizations can be made on the role of urban areas for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Natural, semi-natural, and planted forests are a key asset worldwide, providing a broad range of positive externalities. For sustainable forest planning and management, remote sensing (RS) platforms are rapidly going mainstream. In a framework where scientific production is growing exponentially, a systematic analysis of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based forestry research papers is of paramount importance to understand trends, overlaps and gaps. The present review is organized into two parts (Part I and Part II). Part II inspects specific technical issues regarding the application of UAV-RS in forestry, together with the pros and cons of different UAV solutions and activities where additional effort is needed, such as the technology transfer. Part I systematically analyzes and discusses general aspects of applying UAV in natural, semi-natural and artificial forestry ecosystems in the recent peer-reviewed literature (2018-mid-2020). The specific goals are threefold: (i) create a carefully selected bibliographic dataset that other researchers can draw on for their scientific works; (ii) analyze general and recent trends in RS forest monitoring (iii) reveal gaps in the general research framework where an additional activity is needed. Through double-step filtering of research items found in the Web of Science search engine, the study gathers and analyzes a comprehensive dataset (226 articles). Papers have been categorized into six main topics, and the relevant information has been subsequently extracted. The strong points emerging from this study concern the wide range of topics in the forestry sector and in particular the retrieval of tree inventory parameters often through Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP), RGB sensors, and machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, challenges still exist regarding the promotion of UAV-RS in specific parts of the world, mostly in the tropical and equatorial forests. Much additional research is required for the full exploitation of hyperspectral sensors and for planning long-term monitoring.

AB  - Digital transformation (or digitalization) is the process of continuous further development of digital technologies (such as smart devices, cloud services, and Big Data) that have a lasting impact on our economy and society. In this manner, digitalization is a huge driver for permanent change, even in the field of Sustainable Urban Development. In the wake of digitalization, expectations are changing, placing pressure at the societal level on the design and development of smart environments for everything that means Sustainable Urban Development. In this sense, the solution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence into Sustainable Urban Development, because technology can simplify people's lives. The aim of this paper is to ascertain which Sustainable Urban Development dimensions are taken into account when integrating Artificial Intelligence and what results can be achieved. These questions formed the basic framework for this research article. In order to make the current state of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development as a snapshot visible, a systematic review of the current literature between 2012 and 2022 was conducted. The data were collected and analyzed using PRISMA. Based on the studies identified, we found a significant growth in studies, starting in 2018, and that Artificial Intelligence applications refer to the Sustainable Urban Development dimensions of environmental protection, economic development, social justice and equity, culture, and governance. The used Artificial Intelligence techniques in Sustainable Urban Development cover a broad field of Artificial Intelligence, such as Artificial Intelligence in general, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Neuronal Networks, Operations Research, Predictive Analytics, and Data Mining. However, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development, challenges are marked out. These include responsible municipal policies, awareness of data quality, privacy and data security, the formation of partnerships among stakeholders (e.g., local citizens, civil society, industry, and various levels of government), and transparency and traceability in the implementation and rollout of Artificial Intelligence. A first step was taken towards providing an overview of the possible applications of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development. It was clearly shown that Artificial Intelligence is also gaining ground in this sector.

AB  - Objectives: Local government services and policies affect health determinants across many sectors such as planning, transportation, housing and leisure. Researchers and policymakers have argued that decisions affecting wider determinants of health, well-being and inequalities should be informed by evidence. This study explores how information and evidence are defined, assessed and utilised by local professionals situated beyond the health sector, but whose decisions potentially affect health: in this case, practitioners working in design, planning and maintenance of the built environment.
   Design: A qualitative study using three focus groups. A thematic analysis was undertaken.
   Setting: The focus groups were held in UK localities and involved local practitioners working in two UK regions, as well as in Brazil, USA and Canada.
   Participants: UK and international practitioners working in the design and management of the built environment at a local government level.
   Results: Participants described a range of data and information that constitutes evidence, of which academic research is only one part. Built environment decision-makers value empirical evidence, but also emphasise the legitimacy and relevance of less empirical ways of thinking through narratives that associate their work to art and philosophy. Participants prioritised evidence on the acceptability, deliverability and sustainability of interventions over evidence of longer term outcomes (including many health outcomes). Participants generally privileged local information, including personal experiences and local data, but were less willing to accept evidence from contexts perceived to be different from their own.
   Conclusions: Local-level built environment practitioners utilise evidence to make decisions, but their view of 'best evidence' appears to prioritise local relevance over academic rigour. Academics can facilitate evidence-informed local decisions affecting social determinants of health by working with relevant practitioners to improve the quality of local data and evaluations, and by advancing approaches to improve the external validity of academic research.

AB  - North America is covered in 2.5 million km(2) of wetlands, which is the remainder of an estimated 56% of wetlands lost since the 1700s. This loss has resulted in a decrease in important habitat and services of great ecological, economic, and recreational benefits to humankind. To better manage these ecosystems, since the 1970s, wetlands in North America have been classified with increasing regularity using remote sensing technology. Since then, optimal methods for wetland classification by numerous researchers have been examined, assessed, modified, and established. Over the past several decades, a large number of studies have investigated the effects of different remote sensing factors, such as data type, spatial resolution, feature selection, classification methods, and other parameters of interest on wetland classification in North America. However, the results of these studies have not yet been synthesized to determine best practices and to establish avenues for future research. This paper reviews the last 40 years of research and development on North American wetland classification through remote sensing methods. A meta-analysis of 157 relevant articles published since 1980 summarizes trends in 23 parameters, including publication, year, study location, application of specific sensors, and classification methods. This paper also examines is the relationship between several remote sensing parameters (e.g., spatial resolution and type of data) and resulting overall accuracies. Finally, this paper discusses the future of remote sensing of wetlands in North America with regard to upcoming technologies and sensors. Given the increasing importance and vulnerability of wetland ecosystems under the climate change influences, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review in support of the continued, improved, and novel applications of remote sensing for wetland mapping across North America and to provide a fundamental knowledge base for future studies in this field.

AB  - Smart City has been an emerging research domain for Government, Businesses, and researchers in the last few years. The Indian government is also interested and investing lots of funds to develop smart cities. These cities are technology-based and require interdisciplinary research and development for successful implementation. Over the last few decades, various technological interventions have created a tendency to provide smart everyday objects to make human life more comfortable. The emergence of the smart city paradigm is a response to creating a future city that guarantees the well-being and rights of its citizens from the perspective of industrial development: industry, urban planning, environment, and sustainable development. There are several subdomains in the smart city for the research. To work with the different subdomains in a smart city, proper guidance about the background of the smart city is required. This research paper is a guide for the same. This research paper represents a systematic literature review of the smart city domain. This paper carries out a systematic review of research papers published in various well-reputed journals like IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, etc., between 2011 and 2021. This paper will help the government, businesses, and researchers aiming to enhance the smart city concept. Initially, this paper discusses the origin and emergence of this concept, followed by a few definitions and characteristics with the real roadmap and primary supporting pillars of the smart city. This paper discusses a typical architecture having different layers like Sensing, Transportation, Data Management, and Application Layers. There are various supporting technologies and platforms for the smart city; hence implementations are impossible without these technologies and media. This research paper discusses different components of the smart city. A broad literature survey is being done to observe various challenges, opportunities, and future trends in the smart city. This research paper can guide the researchers and provide the research direction in the smart city domain.

AB  - Environmental issues such as environmental pollutions and climate change are the impacts of globalization and become debatable issues among academics and industry key players. One of the environmental issues which is air pollution has been catching attention among industrialists, researchers, and communities around the world. However, it has always neglected until the impacts on human health become worse, and at times, irreversible. Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning. This is specifically aims to identify the association of health impact and pollution based on socio-economic activities and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for impact assessment. The output of the system will be utilized for hospitals and healthcare services management and planning. The proposed solution is expected to accommodate the needs of the critical and prioritization of sensitive group of publics during pollution seasons. Our finding will bring positive impacts to the society in terms of improved healthcare services quality, environmental and health sustainability. The findings are beneficial to local authorities either in healthcare or environmental monitoring institutions especially in the developing countries.

AB  - Synthetic pesticides (e.g. herbicides, fungicides and insecticides) are used widely in agriculture to protect crops from pests, weeds and disease. However, their use also comes with a range of environmental concerns. One key concern is the effect of insecticides on non-target organisms such as bees, who provide pollination services for crops and wild plants. This systematic literature review quantifies the existing research on bees and insecticides broadly, and then focuses more specifically on non-neonicotinoid insecticides and non-honeybees. We find that articles on honeybees (Apis sp.) and insecticides account for 80% of all research, with all other bees combined making up 20%. Neonicotinoids were studied in 34% of articles across all bees and were the most widely studied insecticide class for non-honeybees overall, with almost three times as many studies than the second most studied class. Of non-neonicotinoid insecticide classes and non-honeybees, the most studied were pyrethroids and organophosphates followed by carbamates, and the most widely represented bee taxa were bumblebees (Bombus), followed by leaf-cutter bees (Megachile) and mason bees (Osmia). Research has taken place across several countries, with the highest numbers of articles from Brazil and the US, and with notable gaps from countries in Asia, Africa and Oceania. Mortality was the most studied effect type, while sub-lethal effects such as on behaviour were less studied. Few studies tested how the effect of insecticides were influenced by multiple pressures, such as climate change and co-occurring pesticides (cocktail effects). As anthropogenic pressures do not occur in isolation, we suggest that future research also addresses these knowledge gaps. Given the changing global patterns in insecticide use, and the increasing inclusion of both non-honeybees and sub-lethal effects in pesticide risk assessment, there is a need for expanding research beyond its current state to ensure a strong scientific evidence base for the development of risk assessment and associated policy.

AB  - The efficient use of land, water, and energy resources in Africa is crucial for achieving sustainable food systems (SFSs). A SFS refers to all the related activities and processes from farm to fork and the range of actors contributing to the availability of food at all times. This study aimed to analyse the growth in the land-water-energy (LWE) nexus integration in sustainable food system research. The focus was on publication growth, the thematic areas covered, and how the research addressed the policies, programmes, and practices using a socio-economic lens. The study utilised a systematic literature review approach, following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study underscored the limited emphasis on the socio-economic perspective in the examination of the LWE nexus within sustainable food system research in Africa. Policies, governance, institutional influences, and social inclusion are crucial for addressing the region-specific challenges and achieving sustainable outcomes, but they seemed to be underrepresented in current research efforts. More so, this review revealed a paucity of research on key influencing factors like gender, conflict, culture, and socio-political dynamics. Ignoring these social factors might contribute to an inadequate management of natural resources, perpetuating issues related to food security and equity in resource use and decision-making. Additionally, the dominance of non-African institutions in knowledge production found in this review highlighted a potential gap in locally owned solutions and perspectives, which are crucial for effective policy development and implementation, often leading to failures in addressing region-specific challenges and achieving sustainable outcomes. Overall, the study highlighted the need for a more holistic approach that not only considers the technical aspects of the LWE nexus but also the social, cultural, and institutional dimensions. Additionally, fostering collaboration with local institutions and ensuring a diverse range of influencing factors can contribute to more comprehensive and contextually appropriate solutions for achieving sustainable food systems in Africa.

AB  - The primary aim of this paper is to identify key similarities and differences in the conceptualization of culture across the major theories of regional socioeconomic science, including economic, business, administrative, social, cultural and political dimensions acting at the regional and local scales. The second goal is to present an overview of the knowledge base and third to cohesively examine and partially recreate the topic using the semi-systematic review method. The final objective of examining the aforementioned issues is to clarify the dynamic correlation in the structuring of business and innovation culture, as well as to identify the characteristics that contribute to the sustainable culture of business and regional innovation systems, including long-term sustainable development. The research shows that the coexistence and combination of innovative culture at the business and regional levels should be perceived as a dynamic and co-evolutionary process involving a variety of factors. Local organizations and institutes that foster entrepreneurship are among the elements that enhance the innovation culture; however, having all of the resources in isolation is insufficient for an efficient ecosystem. This study proposes the establishment of a framework that will enhance the growth of innovation, cultural evolution and regional ecosystem performance. The Institutes of Local Development and Innovation (ILDI) are a policy idea that might give effective micro-meso-level solutions for the region. These policy proposals will diagnose the regional business culture under the prism of strategy, technology, and management levels. The specific investigation attempted in this paper demonstrates that several converging fruitful paths have already been created in the relative international literature. These paths could be combined and deepened further by studying the close evolutionary interconnection between business and regional innovation culture as it emerges at a global scale in the present.

AB  - Background: Globally, oral health training has shown positive influence on knowledge, competency and practices for both oral and non-oral health-care workers towards integration of oral health into primary health care (PHC). Sub-Saharan Africa has very divergent social-cultural-political-economic settings. Since healthcare is contextual, it is necessary to review oral health training programs in this region to establish if their formulation, implementation and evaluation are context-reliant.
   Objective: To assess if oral health trainings aimed at integrating oral health into PHC in sub-Saharan Africa were context-reliant.
   Methodology: The reviewers searched five electronic databases and WHO sites. Selection of publications was done using the PRISMA framework. Oral health training programs for oral and non-oral health-care workers in sub-Saharan Africa published in English language between year 2001 and 2020 were included in the study.
   Findings: Only 4 (0.8%) of the original 512 publications for oral health-care workers and 9 (1.5%) of the 613 for non-oral health-care workers publications met the inclusion criteria. Countries established and/or increased number of dental schools, 1 university adopted competency-based curriculum and 2 introduced community rotations. Dental auxiliaries varied by cadre, training duration and scope of practice. Non-oral health-care workers training programs used diverse approaches like pre-service, workshops and printed materials. Target groups for the trainings varied from nurses, traditional healers, health promotion officers to community health volunteers. Evaluations were done mainly using pre-post or quasi-experimental studies. Outcomes of interest varied from level of knowledge, services provision, early childhood caries, oral health seeking behavior and oral hygiene practices.
   Conclusion: Oral health training for integration of oral health into PHC in sub-Saharan Africa varied by targeted cadre, training methods and evaluation method and scope. It was thus context-reliant. More programs are necessary to accommodate other training approaches, evaluation methods and other health-care cadres in the region.

AB  - Background: Randomized trials have shown conflicting results regarding differences in outcomes according to anesthesia type on the prevalence of postoperative delirium (POD) or postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in hip surgery patients. The aim of this Meta analysis is to compare the effect of general and regional anesthesia in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
   Methods: A literature search for meta-analysis was performed using Pubmed, The Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science citation index for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the regional anesthesia (RA) to general anesthesia (GA) for postoperative outcomes in elderly undergoing hip fracture surgery till June 2022. The primary outcomes were the incidence of POD or POCD at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were 30 days mortality rate and other adverse events. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane methodology.
   Results: Eight studies including 3555 elderly patients over 65 years old showed that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of POD or POCD between RA and GA at 24 h [OR 0.73; 95% coincidence interval (CI) 0.19, 2.71, I-2 = 53%; n = 452; P = 0.63], at 3 days [OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.79, 1.35, I-2 = 0%; n = 1362; P = 0.82], at 7 days [OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.41, 1.52, I-2 = 51%; n = 1336; P = 0.47], respectively. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of other adverse events.
   Conclusions: No significant difference was found in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction after either general or regional anesthesia in elderly patients. Our finding of similar outcomes at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days postoperatively with either technique suggests that anesthesia choices for hip-fracture surgery may be based on the individual characteristics of each patient rather than on anticipated differences in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) disposal in landfills or discharge into sewer systems could cause severe environmental challenges. Therefore, extensive efforts are made to develop strategies for its effective management, aligned with circular bioeconomy and zero-discharge principles and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Among existing strategies, converting WCO into biodiesel is promising; however, biodiesel production from this waste stream could induce many direct and indirect environmental impacts, which should be scrutinized using advanced sustainability assessment tools. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful tool that can be applied to assess the environmental sustainability of WCO biodiesel production in comparison with diesel and firstgeneration biodiesel production. Accordingly, the present review aims to scrutinize the existing literature on the LCA analysis of WCO biodiesel production to shed light on the state-of-the-art of the application of this methodology in this domain, identify research gaps, and introduce future research opportunities. Although environmental assessment of biodiesel production by LCA is well-established, several limitations and concerns still exist. Overall, system boundaries have generally been clearly defined in the published literature; however, some studies have ignored waste management; for example, disposal of soap and other solid residues has usually been removed from the analysis. Furthermore, the "zero-burden assumption" applied to WCO (as biodiesel feedstock) in the published literature might not be a valid hypothesis since this waste stream could be a raw material for some other applications. At the inventory level, the inadequacy of the data, particularly information associated with the production of novel catalysts (including enzymes) and materials used for product purification, is also a problematic issue for the current and under development technologies used in WCO biodiesel production. Therefore, future studies should focus on decreasing the existing uncertainties mentioned throughout the present work. Moreover, efforts should be put into assessing the environmental impacts of WCO biodiesel production systems by employing innovative techniques, e.g., hydrodynamic cavitation reactors, integrating

AB  - Climate change is encouraging a growing interest worldwide to increase renewable distributed generation (DG) integration into the power grid. DG is free from greenhouse gas emissions and can assist in mitigating the energy crisis and reducing energy costs. However, due to its variable nature and bidirectional power flows, high penetration of such DGs, particularly solar and wind, might create significant problems. Some of the issues could be related to reduced power quality, excessive power loss, and low utilization rate of power equipment. Optimal DG allocation can effectively alleviate these challenges by enhancing voltage stability, relieving the overloads of feeders, and improving the reliability of the power grid. Introducing energy storage systems (ESSs) in the network provide another possible approach to solve the above problems by stabilizing voltage and frequency. Therefore, it is essential to allocate distributed ESSs optimally on the distribution network to fully exploit their advantages. Enormous research effort has been put into these areas over the last decade by industries, utilities, and research communities. This paper presents an extensive review on the optimal planning and deployment of DGs, ESSs, and coordinated DGs and ESSs. This paper also will look at their strengths and weaknesses, the barriers to their implementation, and the associated technologies used in their implementation. Finally, this paper reviews the methods of uncertainty modelling in DG and ESS planning and their merits and drawbacks. This review includes a survey of the deployment planning approaches and investigates challenges with recom-mendations for future deployment. This review will be beneficial for use by utilities, researchers, investors, and stakeholders when considering the future deployment of DGs and ESSs in distribution networks to ensure a reliable and sustainable power system.

AB  - Global warming is a problem that threatens humanity, with livestock being one of the causes. A systematic literature review was carried out by using some appropriate elements of the PRISMA statement to identify disciplines that work to mitigate the effects of the livestock industry by organizing them according to their approach to addressing this problem. The main objective is to find information and classify the disciplines, papers, literature review methodologies, research gaps, authors, and journals developing the management of the cattle supply chain. This paper could analyze and mitigate the adverse effects on society and the environment generated by the industry, organizing them according to their approach. Twenty databases were consulted between March and May 2020, from which 146 review documents were chosen. The papers reviewed were published between 2003 and 2020. The eligibility criteria for selection were open access to the full text, publication in an indexed journal, and a focus on any discipline related to cattle. The unselected papers did not have DOIs or duplicates, and those focused on other types of meat and book chapters. Subsequently, the information in the selected papers was described and consolidated, and these papers had 602 authors and were from 99 journals. Next, a discipline categorization was proposed. The results were organized, showing that among all the analysis criteria, the category of veterinary medicine had the best results in terms of indicators; therefore, additional research is needed on the other disciplines, especially in culture, technology, management, quality control, tanneries, and transportation, as there was less research within these disciplines. It is recommended that research on a mix of the different proposed disciplines be conducted. The proposed categorization's main contribution is to identify and group the cattle supply chain's different disciplines and the definition of research gaps organized under a structure organizational management model. Finally, a multicriteria selection methodology must be used that prioritizes the discipline categories proposed in this review to guide future research.

AB  - Soils in many regions of the world have a low Se content. Consequently, forages and crops grown on these soils may provide inadequate dietary Se for humans and grazing animals. Selenium supplementation has been used to enhance Se status and milk Se concentration, but results conflict. Milk Se concentration appears to be a useful indicator of animal and herd Se status, and reflects the responsiveness to supplementation. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to summarize all available scientific evidence for the effect of oral Se supplementation on milk Se concentration in cattle. The literature search was based on electronic and nonelectronic databases. Fixed- and random-effects models of meta-analysis were used, and a meta-regression was carried out to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on 42 studies published between 1977 and 2007. Oral Se supplementation resulted in an average increase in milk Se content of 0.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.117, 0.207) mu mol/L, with a significant heterogeneity among studies. Weak publication bias was evident, but it did not change the average effect. The continent where the study was performed, Se source, Se dose, and the interaction between source and dose explained 71% of the between-study variance. On average, American cows supplemented with Se yeast (e.g., 6 mg/h per day) had greater milk Se concentrations (approximately 0.37 mu mol/L) 75 d after the beginning of supplementation when compared with those supplemented with inorganic forms of Se. This information provides a basis for tailoring daily animal requirements and for enhancing the Se intake of consumers of dairy products.

AB  - The decommissioning of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is rapidly increasing because NPPs are not only no longer profitable in many cases but are also being decommissioned due to a lack of public acceptance or political reasons in many countries, particularly in Europe, following the explosion of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. Accordingly, a significant body of research has focused on achieving safe, environmentally sound, and sustainable decommissioning in many countries where there is demand for NPP decommissioning. In order to achieve sustainable decommissioning that restores the NPP site to its pre-NPP environmental state, it is necessary to understand the safety, technology, and cost aspects as well as having the process and strategy to systematically promote them. Although there are a limited number of countries with experience and knowledge in the management of decommissioning multiple NPPs, researchers in countries just starting NPP decommissioning need diverse research information on how to formulate a sustainable decommissioning strategy as well as related factors. In particular, a systematic review of decommissioning strategies, such as DD, ID, and ET, and the influencing factors associated with each strategy is needed from the researcher's point of view. In this regard, this study reviews the research literature on decommissioning strategies for nuclear power plants with a sustainable perspective. A systematic method involving a meta-analysis is used. The results of this study confirm that many researchers are most interested in DD and are dealing with ID and ET at the same level, but in reality, DD and ID are being adopted at similar rates. Thus far, only three ETs have been adopted in the United States. Most countries that have adopted ID are deemed to have been influenced by political decisions.

AB  - Background: Q fever is a neglected zoonosis caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The knowledge of the epidemiology of Q fever in Kenya is limited with no attention to control and prevention programs. The purpose of this review is to understand the situation of Q fever in human and animal populations in Kenya in the past 60 years, and help identify future research priorities for the country.
   Methods: Databases were searched for national and international scientific studies or reports on Q fever. We included studies and reports published between 1950 and 2015 if they reported on Q fever prevalence, incidence, and infection control programs in Kenya. Data were extracted with respect to studies on prevalence of Coxiella infections, study design, study region, the study populations involved, and sorted according to the year of the study.
   Results: We identified 15 studies and reports which qualified for data extraction. Human seroprevalence studies revealed evidence of C. burnetii infections ranging from 3 to 35.8 % in all regions in which surveys were made and two Q fever outbreak episodes. Coxiella burnetii infections found in cattle 7.4-51.1 %, sheep 6.7-20 %, camels 2046 %, and goats 20-46 % revealed variation based on ecoregions and the year of study. Farming and lack of protective clothing were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. However, high quality data is lacking on Q fever awareness, underlying cultural-economic factors influencing C. burnetii infection, and how the pathogen cycles may be embedded in livestock production and management systems in the economically and ecologically different Kenyan regions. We found no studies on national disease incidence estimates or disease surveillance and control efforts.
   Conclusion: Coxiella burnetii infections are common in human and in a wide range of animal populations but are still unrecognized and underestimated thus presenting a significant human and animal health threat in Kenya. The factors influencing pathogen transmission, persistence and spread are poorly understood. Integrated disease surveillance and prevention/control programs are needed in Kenya.

AB  - Aim: We conducted an integrative review of the global-free maternity (FM) policies and evaluated the quality of care (QoC) and cost and cost implications to provide lessons for universal health coverage (UHC). Methodology: Using integrative review methods proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005), we searched through EBSCO Host, ArticleFirst, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Emerald Insight, JSTOR, PubMed, Springer Link, Electronic collections online, and Google Scholar databases guided by the preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA) guideline. Only empirical studies that described FM policies with components of quality and cost were included. There were 43 papers included, and the data were analysed thematically. Results: Forty-three studies that met the criteria were all from developing countries and had implemented different approaches of FM policy. Review findings demonstrated that some of the quality issues hindering the policies were poor management of complications, worsened referral systems, overburdening of staff because of increased utilisation, lack of transport, and low supply of stock. There were some quality improvements on monitoring vital signs by nurses and some procedures met the recommended standards. Equally, mothers still bear the burden of some costs such as the purchase of drugs, transport, informal payments despite policies being 'free'. Conclusions: FM policies can reduce the financial burden on the households if well implemented and sustainably funded. Besides, they may also contribute to a decline in inequity between the rich and poor though not independently. In order to achieve the SDG goal of UHC by 2030, there is a need to promote awareness of the policy to the poor and disadvantaged women in rural areas to help narrow the inequality gap on utilisation and provide a sustainable form of transport through collaboration with partners to help reduce impoverishment of households. Also, there is a need to address elements such as cultural barriers and the role of traditional birth attendants which hinder women from seeking skilled care even when they are freely available.

AB  - Supply chain management aims to designing, managing and coordinating material/product, information and financial flows to fulfill the customer requirements at low costs and thereby increasing supply chain profitability. In the last decades, data envelopment analysis has become the main topic of interest as a mathematical tool to evaluate supply chain management. While, various data envelopment analysis models have been suggested to measure and evaluate the supply chain management, there is a lack of research regarding to systematic literature review and classification of study in this field. Regarding this, some major databases including Web of Science and Scopus have been nominated and systematic and meta-analysis method which called "PRISMA" has been proposed. Accordingly, a review of 75 published articles appearing in 35 scholarly international journals and conferences between 1996 and 2016 have been attained to reach a comprehensive review of data envelopment analysis models in evaluation supply chain management. Consequently, the selected published articles have been categorized by author name, the year of publication, technique, application area, country, scope, data envelopment analysis purpose, study purpose, research gap and contribution, results and outcome, and journals and conferences in which they appeared. The results of this study indicated that areas of supplier selection, supply chain efficiency and sustainable supply chain have had the highest frequently than other areas. In addition, results of this review paper indicated that data envelopment analysis showed great promise to be a good evaluative tool for future evaluation on supply chain management, where the production function between the inputs and outputs was virtually absent or extremely difficult to acquire. The facility of multiple inputs and multiple outputs of the data envelopment analysis model was definitely an attractive one to most researchers and, therefore, the data envelopment analysis procedure had found many applications beyond supply chain management into organization and industry.

AB  - The southern African kingdoms of Eswatini and Lesotho experience recurrent drought-induced disasters. Policies have been enacted, but no attempt has been made to synthesise the effects on disaster resilience. This review analyses the characteristics, quality, and comprehensiveness of drought-resilience policies in Eswatini and Lesotho. We have systematically reviewed public policies that shape responses to disaster resilience published between 1 January 1980 and 30 June 2019. A combination of keywords was used to search electronic bibliographic databases, multidisciplinary databases, key organisational websites, and the first 20 pages of Google for policies that addressed disaster and/or drought resilience. Identified documents were downloaded into an EndNote database and screened for eligibility using predetermined criteria. The logic of events framework was used for quality assessment, and a metaethnographic approach was applied for data synthesis. Three broad categories of characteristics, thematic outcomes and quality, and comprehensiveness of policy documents emerged and are presented. Policy responses contributing to disaster resilience were found in n = 32 out of 13,700 documents. Three (n = 3/32) policies were statutory, and the rest were nonstatutory. Eleven (n = 11/32) were assessed to be of high quality. Policy responses relating to drought resilience focused on reducing vulnerability to recurrent disasters; promoting drought and climate change adaptation; improving agriculture and food security; safeguarding cultural heritage; and preventing gender inequality and gender-based violence as well as improving disaster governance. However, the construct of drought resilience was not strongly articulated as a major policy goal across policy documents. There is an urgent need to promote better understanding of drought resilience in order to motivate policymakers to steer away from reactive interventions and position resilience as a major national policy goal in both countries to expedite inclusive growth and safeguard development gains and the health and wellbeing of the majority of their populations who are rural-based populations.

AB  - Background: Shortages of human resources for health (HRH) have severely hampered the rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. Current rollout models are hospital-and physician-intensive. Task shifting, or delegating tasks performed by physicians to staff with lower-level qualifications, is considered a means of expanding rollout in resource-poor or HRH-limited settings.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review. Medline, the Cochrane library, the Social Science Citation Index, and the South African National Health Research Database were searched with the following terms: task shift*, balance of care, non-physician clinicians, substitute health care worker, community care givers, primary healthcare teams, cadres, and nurs* HIV. We mined bibliographies and corresponded with authors for further results. Grey literature was searched online, and conference proceedings searched for abstracts.
   Results: We found 2960 articles, of which 84 were included in the core review. 51 reported outcomes, including research from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common intervention studied was the delegation of tasks (especially initiating and monitoring HAART) from doctors to nurses and other non-physician clinicians. Five studies showed increased access to HAART through expanded clinical capacity; two concluded task shifting is cost effective; 9 showed staff equal or better quality of care; studies on non-physician clinician agreement with physician decisions was mixed, with the majority showing good agreement.
   Conclusions: Task shifting is an effective strategy for addressing shortages of HRH in HIV treatment and care. Task shifting offers high-quality, cost-effective care to more patients than a physician-centered model. The main challenges to implementation include adequate and sustainable training, support and pay for staff in new roles, the integration of new members into healthcare teams, and the compliance of regulatory bodies. Task shifting should be considered for careful implementation where HRH shortages threaten rollout programmes.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature published on plant-pollinator interactions, from both the plant and pollinator perspective, in the Chilean Mediterranean-type ecosystem (MTE hereafter). Our search identified 69 published papers on 235 native plant species from 62 families. Less than 7.9% of the flowering species inhabiting the Chilean Mediterranean have been studied, and most studies were restricted to only one locality and one reproductive season. The geographic location of the studies differed from a random pattern, showing two well-defined areas where most studies were conducted. Likewise, most studies in the Andes Range were performed above 2000m a.s.l. The number of species of flower visitor per plant species was low (4.25 +/- 0.22), which probably results from the historical and biogeographic isolation of Chile. This literature survey shows that studies relating floral traits with pollinator attraction and plant reproduction are the most frequent topics of research, reaching 37.6% of studies, followed by studies that examine pollination in relation to human impact (16.1%), micro- and macroevolution (14.0%), relationships between pollination and other ecological interactions (10.8%), community and network assessments (11.8%), and effects of abiotic variables on pollination interactions (9.7%). Our review highlights a lack of research on the effects of pollination for anthropogenic land use especially as agricultural practice is one of the most salient features of the Chilean MTE. Future directions to increase our understanding of the role of plant-pollinator relationships for biodiversity maintenance should include: to extend the taxonomic and geographic scope of research, to increase the number of spatial and temporal replicates, to increase the number of studies on pollination networks as they provide estimates of community complexity and putative stability, to develop studies that estimate the importance of pollination for plant demographic parameters and conservation, and to conduct studies that estimate the ecological service provided by Chilean native pollinators for crop yield and sustainable agriculture.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe current evidence for staging low malignant potential ovarian tumors and their conformity to current consensus guidelines and practice from an international perspective.
   DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases was conducted for articles published between January 1990 and April 2015.
   STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies on low malignant potential ovarian tumors that evaluated the prognostic value of disease stage, staging vs no staging, complete vs incomplete staging, or discrete components of staging were eligible. Studies that described only crude survival rates were excluded.
   STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Eligible studies were categorized according to their outcome (disease stage, staging procedure, or discrete staging elements). Data were abstracted using a standard form. Inconsistencies on data abstraction were resolved by consensus among the authors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
   RESULTS: Of 1116 studies, 702 were excluded for irrelevance and 364 for not meeting inclusion criteria. Nine studies were excluded for describing crude survival rates without a comparative conclusion. We found that studies supporting the value of defining disease stage or staging procedures (mostly conducted in northern Europe) included more patients than studies that did not find disease stage or staging useful (predominantly from North America, 4072 vs 3951). Disease stage correlated with survival in 13 of 25 studies, whereas none of the studies that evaluated the value of staging found it beneficial (9 studies, 1979 patients). Studies that evaluated isolated components of staging found no benefit to these procedures. Regional guidelines and consensus reviews drew conclusions based on a limited number of studies that generally originated from the same region.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the correlation of stage with survival was mixed, performing staging procedures for low malignant potential ovarian tumors is not supported by the best available evidence. Guidelines in support of staging based their recommendations on a few regional studies and conflict with better-quality data that do not support staging procedures. An international consensus statement is needed to standardize the surgical management of low malignant potential ovarian tumors.

KW  - Goal setting
AB  - Background Many national malaria programmes have set goals of eliminating malaria, but realistic timelines for achieving this goal remain unclear. In this investigation, historical data are collated on countries that successfully eliminated malaria to assess how long elimination has taken in the past, and thus to inform feasible timelines for achieving it in the future. Methods Annual malaria case series were sought for 56 successful elimination programmes through a non-systematic review. Up to 40 years of annual case counts were compiled leading up to the first year in which zero locally acquired or indigenous cases were reported. To separate the period over which effective elimination efforts occurred from prior background trends, annual case totals were log transformed, and their slopes evaluated for a breakpoint in linear trend using the segmented package in R. The number of years from the breakpoint to the first year with zero cases and the decline rate over that period were then calculated. Wilcox-Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate whether a set of territory characteristics were associated with the timelines and decline rates. Results Case series declining to the first year with zero cases were compiled for 45/56 of the candidate elimination programmes, and statistically significant breakpoints were identified for 42. The median timeline from the breakpoint to the first year with zero local cases was 12 years, over which cases declined at a median rate of 54% per year. Prior to the breakpoint, the median trend was slightly decreasing with median annual decline of < 3%. Timelines to elimination were fastest among territories that lacked land boundaries, had centroids in the Tropics, received low numbers of imported cases, and had elimination certified by the World Health Organization. Conclusion The historical case series assembled here may help countries with aspirations of malaria elimination to set feasible milestones towards this goal. Setting goals for malaria elimination on short timescales may be most appropriate in isolated, low importation settings, such as islands, while other regions aiming to eliminate malaria must consider how to sustainably fund and maintain vital case management and vector control services until zero cases are reached.

AB  - Climate change continues to alter the seasonal timing and extremes of global temperature and precipitation patterns. These departures from historic conditions along with the predicted variability of future climates present a challenge to seed sourcing, or provenance strategy decisions, within the practice of ecological restoration. The "local is best" for seed sourcing paradigm is predicated upon the assumption that ecotypes are genetically adapted to their local environment. However, local adaptations are potentially being outpaced by climate change, and the ability of plant populations to naturally migrate or shift their distribution accordingly may be limited by habitat fragmentation. Restoration practitioners and natural area managers have a general understanding of the importance of matching the inherent adaptations of source populations with the current and/or future site conditions where those seeds or propagules are planted. However, for many species used in seed-based restoration, there is a lack of empirical evidence to guide seed sourcing decisions, which are critical for the longevity and ecological function of restored natural communities. With the goal of characterizing, synthesizing, and applying experimental research to guide restoration practice, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on provenance testing of taxa undertaken to inform seed sourcing strategies for climate resiliency. We found a strong bias in the choice of study organism: most studies have been conducted on tree species. We also found a strong bias regarding where this research has been conducted, with North America (52%) and Europe (31%) overrepresented. Experiments were designed to assess how propagule origin influences performance across both climatic (26%) and geographic (15%) distance, with some studies focused on determining how climate normal conditions (39%) impacted performance related to survivorship, growth and other parameters. We describe the patterns and gaps our review identified, highlight specific topics which require further research, and provide practical suggestions of immediate and longer-term tools that restoration practitioners can use to guide and build resilient natural communities under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Macroalgal blooms are increasing globally as a result of anthropogenic stressors and are leading to negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. There is, however, an opportunity to utilise nuisance macroalgae by creating useful and economically viable products. Thus relieving pressure on diminishing, but sought-after natural resources. Here we have undertaken a systematic review of the literature to synthesise data from 639 peer-reviewed papers to: identify the spatial and temporal nature of macroalgal blooms; quantify the ecological and socio-economic impacts associated with these blooms; outline the conversion of macroalgal biomass into products, in particular for the main blooming genera; provide an assessment of input and product costs for different compounds; and provide feasibility assessments generated from Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Globally, green macroalgae (chlorophyta), predominately Ulva spp. (52%), were found to be the most reported and spatially distributed blooming algae. However, the largest single bloom was produced by Sargassum spp. (phaeophyta), producing >20 million tonnes in 2018. Ecologically, the dominant negative impacts of macroalgal blooms were a decline in species richness and abundance; with seagrasses and fish most impacted. Social and economic impacts of macroalgal blooms were under-reported in peer-reviewed papers and globally under-researched, but where reported, there were clear negative impacts. For nuisance green macroalgal species, biorefining to produce multiple products was the most researched application, yet in the feasibility assessments there was a stronger case for biofuel production. Limited TEA or LCA were identified focussing on bloom material. There is an urgent need for research to provide the tools for the effective utilisation of macroalgal blooms. We recommend increased research into bioprocessing and a TEA of nuisance macroalgal blooms especially for Ulva and other chlorophyta, which are predominantly problematic. If this is achievable then exciting pathways utilising problem macroalgae can be incorporated into the circular economy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Portulaca oleracea L. (PO), popularly known as purslane, has been documented in ethnopharmacology in various countries and regions. Traditional application records indicated that PO might be used extensively to treat the common cold, dysentery, urinary tract infections, coughing, eye infections, skin problems, gynecological diseases, and pediatric illnesses.Aim of the review: This paper includes a systematic review of the traditional usage, phytochemicals, pharmaco-logical activity, and potential uses of PO to provide an overview of the research for further exploitation of PO resources.Materials and methods: This article uses "Portulaca oleracea L." and "purslane" as the keywords and collects relevant information on PO from different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct, ACS, Wiley, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and ancient meteria medica.Results: PO is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is grown worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that purslane has the effect of improving eyesight, eliminating evil qi, quenching thirst, purgation, diuresis, hemostasis, regulating qi, promoting hair growth, detoxifying, and avoiding epidemic qi. Recent phytochemical investigations have shown that PO is a rich source of flavonoids, homoisoflavonoids, alkaloids, organic acids, esters, lignans, terpenoids, catecholamines, sterols, and cerebrosides. The purslane extracts or compounds have exhibited numerous biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, renoprotective, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, metabolic, muscle relaxant, anti-asthmatic and anti-osteoporosis properties. The significant omega-3 fatty acids, vital amino acids, minerals, and vitamins found in purslane also provide nutritional benefits. Purslane as a food/feed additive in the food industry and animal husbandry has caused concern. Its global wide distribution and tolerance to abiotic stress characteristics make it in the future sustainable development of agriculture a certain position.Conclusions: Based on traditional usage, phytochemicals, and pharmacological activity, PO is a potential me-dicinal and edible plant with diverse pharmacological effects. Due to purslane's various advantages, it may have vast application potential in the food and pharmaceutical industries and animal husbandry.

AB  - The transition from a linear economy (LE) to a circular economy (CE) is not just about mitigating the negative impacts of LE, but also about considering changes in infrastructure, while leveraging the power of technology to reduce resource production and consumption and waste generation, and improve long-term resilience. The existing research suggests that digital technologies (DTs) have great potential to drive the CE. However, despite the exponential growth and increasing interest in studies on DTs and the CE from year 2016 onwards, few systematic studies on the application of DTs to enable the CE have been found. In addition, the current status and development direction of the DT-driven CE is unclear, and the potential of DTs to support CE implementation is under-researched. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the potential of DTs to drive the CE. This paper set out to analyze the current status and development of the DT-driven CE and examine future development trends in the field. Using a systematic literature review approach, this paper is the first attempt to use a mixed method, i.e., to combine macro-quantitative bibliometric methods with a micro-qualitative content analysis method to explore the DT-driven CE. The results, which include the research background, co-occurrence clusters, research hotspots, and development trends of keyword co-occurrence network visualization and keyword burst detection, are presented from a macro perspective using two bibliometric analysis softwares. In addition, the use of 13 specific DTs in the CE is analyzed according to seven disciplinary areas (Environmental Sciences and Ecology, Engineering, Science and Technology and Other Topics, Business Economics, Computer Science, Operations Research and Management Science, and Construction and Building Technology) of greatest interest from a micro-qualitative point of view. Further, future trends and challenges facing DT-driven CE development are explored and feasible directions for solutions are proposed.

AB  - The paper analyzes ecotourism's impact on the social, economic, and environmental components of sustainable development. A systematic review of the scientific literature on the topic reveals that the major problem in assessing ecotourism's impact is a lack of a unified approach to methods of measurement and certification in this field. Even approximate estimates show the high economic potential of ecotourism. Processing the data provided by mobile operators, using BigData technologies and the use of electronic visit permits, proves to be the most promising means to record the number of tourist arrivals. This data allows scientists to measure the level of tourism influence on the ecosystem. Studying foreign experience, eco-certification does not cover all objects of ecotourism. Although some countries, notably Australia, already have significant experience in implementing and using national eco-certification programs. In Ukraine, only several hotels and beaches have received eco-certification. Research on the impact of ecotourism on ecology has provided mixed results. We do not practice if ecotourism with caution; it jeopardizes the ecosystems on which its development depends. To promptly identify and prevent all negative consequences of the tourism in Ukraine, it is necessary to create (using foreign experience) tourist observatories. It should integrate the operation of such observatories into the national system of environmental and fiscal monitoring. Further development of this type of tourism in Ukraine requires more investments and support from the government. Therefore, it is necessary 1) to develop and implement a system of tax incentives for small businesses in ecotourism; 2) to enhance fiscal decentralization so that the environmental tax remains at the disposal of local communities and consequently local ecosystems; 3) to adjust the tourist tax base. The paper provides a generalization of the overseas experience, studies by scientists dedicated to the impact of ecotourism on the level of ecological culture of tourists and a local population. It presents conclusions regarding significant potential and opportunities for further successful development of ecotourism in Ukraine.

AB  - A major programme of dam building is underway in many of the world's tropical countries. This raises the question of whether existing research is sufficient to fully understand the impacts of dams on tropical river systems. This paper provides a systematic review of what is known about the impacts of dams on river flows, sediment dynamics and geomorphic processes in tropical rivers. The review was conducted using the SCOPUS (R) and Web of Science (R) databases, with papers analysed to look for temporal and geographic patterns in published work, assess the approaches used to help understand dam impacts, and assess the nature and magnitude of impacts on the flow regimes and geomorphology ('hydromorphology') of tropical rivers. As part of the review, a meta-analysis was used to compare key impacts across different climate regions. Although research on tropical rivers remains scarce, existing work is sufficient to allow us to draw some very broad, general conclusions about the nature of hydromorphic change: tropical dams have resulted in reductions in flow variability, lower flood peaks, reductions in sediment supply and loads, and complex geomorphic adjustments that include both channel incision and aggradation at different times and downstream distances. At this general level, impacts are consistent with those observed in other climate regions. However, studies are too few and variable in their focus to determine whether some of the more specific aspects of change observed in tropical rivers (e.g. time to reach a new, adjusted state, and downstream recovery distance) differ consistently from those in other regions. The review helps stress the need for research that incorporates before-after comparisons of flow and geomorphic conditions, and for the wider application of tools available now for assessing hydromorphic change. Very few studies have considered hydromorphic processes when designing flow operational policies for tropical dams. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - African cities are largely less-built with agile informal settlements and multiple ecologies that harbor different pathways for resilience to climate change. We undertook a qualitative systematic review of academic and policy evidence, to address the question of what interventions are emerging at neigbourhood to city scale to enhance resilience to climate change in Africa. Resilience at neigbourhood scale often stems from harnessing the local resource base and technologies for urban agriculture and forestry; alternative energy from wastes; grassed drainages for protection against erosion; recreation along dry riverbeds; fog-water harvesting; and adjustments in irrigation schedules. At city scale, planning is targeted at buildings, mobility and energy service delivery as the objects to be made resilient. The review established that evidence on comparisons across regions is mainly on East, West and South African cities, and much less on cities in Northern and Central Africa. Ecological comparisons are majorly on coastal and inland cities, with minimal representation of semi-arid and mountainous cities. Resilience efforts in capital cities are the most dominant in the literature, with less emphasis on secondary cities and towns, which is necessary for a deeper understanding of the role played by inter-municipal and inter-metropolitan collaborations. African cities can bring context-sensitivity to global debates on climate resilience, if theoretical perspectives are generated from emerging interventions across case studies. We conclude with suggestions on what future research needs to take on, if evidence on resilience to climate change in African cities is to be strengthened.

AB  - Camera traps have been used increasingly as a research tool to monitor wildlife globally, and have become more advanced, thereby improving their performance and lowering costs. Their use has allowed researchers to study a range of species, including rare and elusive species, particularly in remote areas, in a non-invasive, reliable and cost-effective way. In this review, we sought to document the camera trapping research on terrestrial wildlife conducted in Africa, identifying countries and habitat types of focus, and how these camera trap research trends in Africa could be improved in the future. Through a systematic literature search, we found 408 peer-reviewed publications using camera traps to study terrestrial wildlife in Africa, with the first being in 2005 and up to 2021. Although camera trap studies were conducted in 38 African countries, most were in South Africa (28.9 %). Most studies assessed the occupancy of species (41.4 %). The studies covered a range of taxa, with mammals being the most popular. The majority of research focussed on large carnivores (24.8 %), with a particular focus on leopards (Panthera pardus) (60 studies). Most studies (43.9 %) focused on a single species, with forests (174 studies, 42.6 %) and savannah/bushveld (145 studies, 35.5 %) being the habitat type of focus. There was also a strong preference for camera trap studies to be conducted in protected areas (68.9 %). The camera trap methods used varied considerably between studies, which included: the number of camera trap stations, survey length, trap effort, camera trap make and model, camera trap flash type, interval delay, camera multishot, height of camera trap placement, camera trap layout method and whether the camera trap was baited. These variations are expected because of the difference in research goals posed by each study. However, studies with similar objectives and/or focus still display a clear lack of standardisation (studies do not conform to a specific standard), which could negatively impact the results obtained, as inappropriate camera trap protocols could affect the detectability of certain species. Future camera trap studies will hopefully extend to countries and taxa that have received little attention, with further research informing appropriate conservation strategies that could reduce the threats to biodiversity.

AB  - With urbanization, rising income and consumption, the production of waste increases. One of the most important directions in the field of sustainable development is the design and implementation of monitoring and management systems for waste collection and removal. Smart waste management (SWM) involves for example collection and analytics of data from sensors on smart garbage bins (SGBs), management of waste trucks and urban infrastructure; planning and optimization of waste truck routes; etc. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research in the field of systems, applications, and approaches vis-a-vis the collection and processing of solid waste in SWM systems. To achieve this objective, we performed a systematic literature review. This study consists of 173 primary studies selected for analysis and data extraction from the 3,732 initially retrieved studies from 5 databases. We 1) identified the main approaches and services that are applied in the city and SGB-level SWM systems, 2) listed sensors and actuators and analyzed their application in various types of SWM systems, 3) listed the direct and indirect stakeholders of the SWM systems, 4) identified the types of data shared between the SWM systems and stakeholders, and 5) identified the main promising directions and research gaps in the field of SWM systems. Based on an analysis of the existing approaches, technologies, and services, we developed recommendations for the implementation of city-level and SGB-level SWM systems.

AB  - Textiles with high global demand and consumption are a necessity in people's daily lives, and assessing and re-ducing the environmental impact of their use stage can make a significant positive contribution to the planet. However, current studies that incorporate textile use stages into system boundaries have yielded highly variable results, both in terms of absolute and relative impacts. The root causes of these discrepancies deserve in-depth investigation. In this context, we conducted an up-to-date descriptive and critical literature review to explore the inconsistencies between studies through a detailed analysis and discussion of current practices in use stage modeling and the final assessment results. A two-step search of the Web of Science database was thus conducted, resulting in a sample of 74 records, including 53 quantitative studies and 21 qualitative or semi-quantitative studies. Inconsistent functional units, non-uniform system boundaries, inaccurate data inventories, and imprac-tical quantification methods were the key issues identified in the reviewed articles that led to large variability be-tween the results of different studies and their inability to be compared with each other. Therefore, the optimization of the modeling methods for the use stage from these four aspects in order to establish a standard-ized methodological system is a priority for subsequent work. Some potential technical tools and theoretical methods, such as automated data acquisition, data mining, simulation techniques and modularity theory, etc., can be considered for future integration and application. In addition, the environmental performance of the use stage was found to be highly subject to consumer behavior and the uncertainties associated with it. Analysis of consumer behavioral characteristics and the mechanisms that shape their behavior based on behavioral sci-ence theories can support the development of effective interventions that contribute to the promotion of sustain-able consumption of textiles and, ultimately, to the global improvement of environmental impacts caused by textile use and care.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Networks of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs), where all extractive activities are prohibited, are the most effective tool to directly protect marine ecosystems from destructive and unsustainable human activities. No-take MPAs and MPA networks have been globally implemented in coastal seas, and their success has been significantly enhanced where science-based biophysical guidelines have informed their design. Increasingly, as human pressure on marine ecosystems is expanding further offshore, governments are establishing offshore MPAs-some very large-or MPA networks. Globally, there are growing calls from scientists, non-government organisations, and national governments to set global conservation targets upwards of 30%. Given that most of the ocean is found either in the high seas or offshore within national Exclusive Economic Zones, large offshore MPAs or networks of MPAs must be a major component of these global targets for ocean protection. However, without adequate design, these offshore MPAs risk being placed to minimise conflict with economic interests, rather than to maximise biodiversity protection. This paper describes detailed biophysical guidelines that managers can use to design effective networks of no-take MPAs in offshore environments. We conducted a systematic review of existing biophysical design guidelines for networks of MPAs in coastal seas, and found consistent elements relating to size, shape, connectivity, timeframes, and representation of biophysical features. However, few of the guidelines are tailored to offshore environments, and few of the large offshore MPAs currently in place were designed systematically. We discuss how the common inshore design guidelines should be revised to be responsive to the characteristics of offshore ecosystems, including giving consideration of issues of scale, data availability, and uncertainty. We propose 10 biophysical guidelines that can be used to systematically design offshore networks of MPAs which will also contribute to the global goal of at least 30% protection globally. Finally, we offer three priority guidelines that reflect the unique conservation needs of offshore ecosystems: emphasising the need for larger MPAs; maximising the inclusion of special features that are known and mapped; and representing minimum percentages of habitats, or, where mapped, bioregions. Ultimately, MPA guidelines need to be embedded within an adaptive management framework, and have the flexibility to respond to emerging knowledge and new challenges.

AB  - Botanical gardens are a primary avenue for ex situ biodiversity conservation. China represents a center of origin for many of the world's cultivated plants, as well as the birthplace of the world's earliest pharmacopoeia and most ancient gardens. Botanical gardens are thought to have originated in China, the only one of four ancient civilizations that has persisted without interruption for the last 5000 years. This paper aims to demonstrate the spatiotemporal changes of Chinese botanical gardens and explore their driving mechanism. Based on a systematic review of the literature, the development of Chinese botanical gardens can be roughly divided into three major stages: an enlightenment stage for ancient botanical gardens (2800 BC-1859 AD), a colonial-exploration stage for modern botanical gardens (1860-1949), and a gradual-development stage for modern botanical gardens (1950-2022). By the end of 2022, China will contain a total of 456 botanical gardens, the most of any country in the world; these gardens will cover an area of 115,000 hectares and preserve 515,000 species of living plants. In the past 5000 years, the temporal and spatial development of Chinese botanical gardens has been linked to social and economic developments. By assessing the achievements of each stage of botanical-garden development, four major factors driving the rise, dissemination, development, and evolution of Chinese botanical gardens were identified: societal wealth/prosperity, demand-driven developments, support from science and education fields, and the promotion of ecological sustainability. Our findings fill the gap in botanical-garden development theory, and serve as a reference for the construction and management of botanical gardens.

AB  - The rapid increase of urban population during the 21 st century has led to the expansion of metropolises and increased demand for land in peri-urban areas, which are often the object of compulsory land acquisition to cover urban development processes. Such a process leads to widespread land tenure changes in a specific system of rights, relationships, and institutions that contradict the nature of land as an essential and limited commodity. These changes continuously create the potential for land tenure conflicts in peri-urban areas, which are often complex and lead to violent, insecure, and unstable disputes. While many efforts have been made to explain the conflicts related to land tenure, and researchers have examined it from various aspects, there is still a deep gap in the integrated understanding of land tenure-related conflicts in peri-urban areas. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of selected sources in order to explain the conflicts related to land tenure in peri-urban areas. In this regard, a meta-synthesis approach was used to review the types of land tenure-related conflicts in the conducted studies to integrate their results. So, 126 sources of land tenure conflicts were identified. The frequency of these sources shows that land tenure-related conflicts in peri-urban areas can be classified into three main categories. The first category considers conflicts in relation to the different interests of land (conflicts of interests-55.3%). The second category attributes them to conflicts among individuals, institutions with one another, or between individuals and institutions (conflicts of power - 23.8%), and 20.9% emphasize on the "conflict in legal and normative frameworks". With these in mind, it is obvious that the explanation of land tenure conflicts in peri-urban areas from different levels and dimensions is crucial for achieving sustainable land tenure.

AB  - Transportation systems are highly dynamic, complex and interdisciplinary in nature, thus transiting it towards sustainability is difficult due to two reasons. One, covering every aspect of it simultaneously is a complicated issue and two, it becomes a barrier to communication among stakeholders with different areas of expertise. Indices (or composite indicators) for sustainable transportation (ST) are useful in overcoming these issues. Constructing indices for ST involves various steps in which the selection of suitable indicator set and framework forms the foundation. Moreover, the choice of most appropriate methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation is also challenging. The main aim of this review paper is to bring forth various methodologies that have been adopted across different regions of the world (at different scales) for the development of ST indices. The effort has been made to explore the challenges (and solutions thereof) regarding the selection of suitable ST indicators and frameworks and also find the spatio-temporal suitability of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation. In this line, literature was first collected and then selected systematically. Then the selected literature was reviewed and analyzed. Various indicator and framework typologies followed by the challenges involved in their selection were discussed along with transportation specific examples. Next, a suite of 24 studies in which the primary focus was on the development of the ST index was further analyzed, highlighting the diversity in the choice of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation. Relative pros and cons of 7 normalization methods, 5 weighting methods, and 7 aggregation methods were tabulated to discuss their suitability. As a result of the systematic review and analysis of the literature, 18 specific criteria, broadly classified into representational, practical and contextual criteria were identified, which we argue will aid transportation professionals as far as the selection of "suitable indicator set" is concerned. To develop a framework for ST, seven essential attributes were identified. Moreover, it was found that answering an integrated set of questions: "why," "what," and "how" to choose and use the ST indicators are crucial in developing robust ST frameworks. The choice of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation with respect to time, scale and space was found critical as it would lead to varying results. It was also found that most of the studies lacked declaration and assessment of assumptions linked with these methods as doing so makes the choice of these methods vague and questionable.

AB  - The growth and management of the marine economy have received significant attention since the United Nations launched the "Our Ocean, Our Future: Call for Action" initiative. However, a lack of systematic review in the field of the marine economy has hindered progress. This study aims to address this issue by offering a unified knowledge analysis framework with bibliometric technology. We comprehensively analyze 6002 records from the Web of Science using software such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and ArcGIS for visualization analysis. This paper has drawn some interesting findings. Firstly, the development of the marine economy has experienced three stages: enlightenment, foundation and rapid growth, with the development process showing more and more apparent geographical cluster characteristics. Secondly, "Sustainable development", "Marine climate change", "Marine ecosystems government" and "Comprehensive performance evaluation" are identified as the mature clusters; meanwhile, "Sea level change", "Marine pollution treatment" and "Sustainable energy exploitation" are potential forefront clusters in marine economy. Based on this, the evolution of knowledge structure about marine economy is found, which changed from discussing the utilization of elements to studying the relationship between them to perform collaborative governance. Finally, this paper concluded by identifying research frontiers and future directions for further study, which includes the development of emerging industries, integration of marine and regional economy, protection of marine ecological and so on. This study can help researchers, policymakers and other participants better understand the knowledge structure and research frontiers of marine economy, and discover the future directions.

   Objectives. To,determine whether occult pathoanatomical lesions in the cervical spine of road traffic fatalities exist and if they can be identified using optimal autopsy techniques.
   Summary of Background Data. Previous investigations have examined pathoanatomical conditions of the cervical spine of road traffic fatalities. However, different methods of investigation have been used, and results of studies are conflicting. Hence, potential pathoanatomical conditions in fatalities and survivors remain a controversial issue.
   Methods. Articles were retrieved searching the MEDLINE, Mantis, and Cochrane libraries. Studies examining the cervical spine of road traffic fatalities at autopsy were included and evaluated according to a set of quality criteria. For in-depth review, only studies using surface cryoplaning microtomy autopsy technique and a control group were included.
   Results. Twenty-seven articles of which three fulfilled the quality criteria were reviewed. In these studies, subtle pathoanatomical lesions were found in the cervical intervertebral discs, cartilaginous endplates, and the articular surfaces and capsules of the zygapophysial joints. The lesions were found exclusively in the traumatized patients and in none of the patients in the control group.
   Conclusions. Occult pathoanatomical lesions in the cervical intervertebral disc and zygapophysial joints after fatal road traffic trauma may exist. Present imaging methods, especially conventional radiography, do not visualize these subtle lesions; hence, underreporting of pathoanatomical lesions during standard autopsy is probably common. These findings may have clinical relevance in the management of road traffic trauma survivors with potentially similar pathoanatomy.

AB  - Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods help decision makers to consider and weigh diverse criteria that include economic, environmental, social and technological aspects. This characteristic makes them a popular tool to comparatively evaluate road transportation fuels and vehicles (RTFV). The aim of this paper is to systematically classify and analyse the literature applying MCDA methods on the evaluation of RTFV. To this end, 40 relevant papers are pinpointed and discussed. We identified a great number of evaluation criteria employed in the reviewed papers from which we have established a concluding list of 41 criteria, that can serve as a pool for future research. A further analysis of the evaluation criteria reveals that the process of criteria selection partly suffers from a lack of scientific foundation and standardization. We propose to standardize the criteria selection process by using the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology as a guiding reference. In addition, we compared the MCDA results obtained from studies with relatively similar setups and found that the evaluation results are also generally similar and seem not to be influenced by the particular MCDA method employed. Based on the results of the reviewed papers, one may say that electricity and ethanol appear to be good alternatives for light vehicles, whereas gaseous fuels seem more appropriate for heavy vehicles like buses. Striking deviations from these generally observed results are often caused by specific evaluation contexts, particular criteria taken into account and unusual weight sets applied.

AB  - Rapid urbanization in China is driving the need of urban rainfall-runoff pollution control technologies due to adverse impacts on water environment. In this study, literature from China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science and Scopus in 1995/1/1-2019/5/15 are used to review research hotspots, development process and future directions of urban rainfall-runoff pollution control technologies in China and global world. Temporal evolution of publications showed that source reduction played better growing trend in urban rainfall-runoff pollution control field for both China and global world. Furthermore, with bibliometric tool, density visualization maps and co-occurrence network maps were created to identify research hotspots in China and global world. By comprehensively analyzing research hotspots above and development process from extracted literature, future directions of urban rainfall-runoff pollution control technologies were predicted. For model and strategy, both China and global world would concern on the accuracy of models to evaluate combination technologies. For source reduction, China would explore rainwater purification in sponge city, while global world would investigate match characteristics between specific regions and control technologies, combination between model and technologies, and improvement of pollutants removal. For process control, China would enhance ecological gutter inlet performance, whereas global world would concentrate on optimization of rainwater harvesting system. For post treatment, China would estimate modified hydrocylone and coagulation technology, and improve

AB  - Background: Brucellosis is a debilitating zoonotic disease affecting humans and animals. A comprehensive, evidence-based assessment of literature and officially available data on animal and human brucellosis for Kenya are missing. The aim of the current review is to provide frequency estimates of brucellosis in humans, animals and risk factors for human infection, and help to understand the current situation in Kenya.
   Methods: A total of accessible 36 national and international publications on brucellosis from 1916 to 2016 were reviewed to estimate the frequency of brucellosis in humans and animals, and strength of associations between potential risk factors and seropositivity in humans in Kenya.
   Results: The conducted studies revealed only few and fragmented evidence of the disease spatial and temporal distribution in an epidemiological context. Bacteriological evidence revealed the presence of Brucella (B.) abortus and B. melitensis in cattle and human patients, whilst B. suis was isolated from wild rodents only. Similar evidence for Brucella spp infection in small ruminants and other animal species is unavailable. The early and most recent serological studies revealed that animal brucellosis is widespread in all animal production systems. The animal infection pressure in these systems has remained strong due to mixing of large numbers of animals from different geographical regions, movement of livestock in search of pasture, communal sharing of grazing land, and the concentration of animals around water points. Human cases are more likely seen in groups occupationally or domestically exposed to livestock or practicing risky social-cultural activities such as consumption of raw blood and dairy products, and slaughtering of animals within the homesteads. Many brucellosis patients are misdiagnosed and probably mistreated due to lack of reliable laboratory diagnostic support resulting to adverse health outcomes of the patients and routine disease underreporting. We found no studies of disease incidence estimates or disease control efforts.
   Conclusion: The risk for re-emergence and transmission of brucellosis is evident as a result of the co-existence of animal husbandry activities and social-cultural activities that promote brucellosis transmission. Well-designed countrywide, evidence-based, and multidisciplinary studies of brucellosis at the human/livestock/wildlife interface are needed. These could help to generate reliable frequency and potential impact estimates, to identify Brucella reservoirs, and to propose control strategies of proven efficacy.

AB  - Ganga alluvial plains have attracted a diverse field of geoscientific research in the last few decades. Earlier studies were mostly focused on subsurface structure mapping using geophysical techniques followed by sedimentological and stratigraphic analyses of alluvial sediments of the Ganga Plains. Recent decades have witnessed the incorporation of hydrological data in geomorphic studies, which led to a new set of process-based studies and the application of physical models to understand the evolution and dynamics of fluvial systems in the alluvial plains. Novel methodologies, observed data of water and sediment fluxes, availability of high-resolution remote sensing datasets especially Digital Elevation Models (DEM) data for watershed modeling, and incorporation of hydrological and geomorphic models have resulted in new insights into this highly dynamic sediment dispersal system. Such quantitative understandings are essential to design scientific strategies for sustainable management of river systems, and flood hazards and to understanding river's past and future through modeling approaches. Various hydro-geomorphic approaches, concepts, and applications have been initiated in the last two decades. We provide a systematic review of these advances and highlight the emergence of a new research area for geomorphic inquiry at a modern time scale with a major emphasis on the quantitative understanding of cause-effect relationships. Finally, a new set of research questions has been suggested with the prospect to define some of the necessary required research directions in the future studies of the Ganga Plains.

AB  - Sustainable innovation is a solution for the hospitality and tourism (H&T) industries to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience, and ensure survival post-pandemic. The primary aim of our review is to systematically identify and critically review the literature on sustainable innovation in H&T amid COVID-19 (conducted in 2020 and 2021), in order to synthesize and classify prevalent types, antecedents, and outcomes of sustainable innovation. The authors present a comprehensive review of the 58 articles on sustainable innovation in H&T through the Web of Science (WoS) database, spanning over 2 years (2020-2021). This review demonstrates that since the beginning of COVID-19, H&T have strongly mobilized network technologies (especially social media and digital platforms) and data-processing technologies (especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)) in comparison with physical-digital interface technologies (especially Virtual Reality (VR)), while physical-digital process technologies remain very limited in these industries. Several relevant antecedents of the adoption of sustainable innovation, more specifically digital technologies, have been identified at multiple levels of analysis, including the organizational, managerial, and stakeholder levels. Our research also reveals several consequences of the adoption of sustainable innovation in H&T. These consequences were congregated according to the three main dimensions related to sustainability in economic, social, and environmental outcomes. This study provides important practical implications for the H&T sectors in the digital era and post-pandemic. The current research is the first study to systematically and critically review sustainable innovation in an H&T context.

AB  - The stormwater management practices have changed from conveyance-oriented to storage-oriented, as part of the Best Management Practices (BMPs). Still, uncontrolled development increases potential pollutants in the stormwater, which conveys into a water body or river. Continuous improvements in the filtration mechanism would complement stormwater management. For the past decades, there is progress in applying granular filter media for stormwater quality improvement. However, the reports were not systematically reviewed. In this paper, the recent five years research that utilizes granular filter media for improving stormwater quality was retrieved and reviewed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was referred to, where Scopus and Web of Sciences, two primary journal databases, were used. Initially, keywords searching strings have resulted in 467 articles, which were further screened. Four themes have been formed: stormwater management, stormwater characteristics, separation mechanisms, and future perspectives. Next, two sub-themes and two sub-sub-themes were further established. Then, 65 articles were included manually to complement the themes developed to explore the potential agro-industrial wastes as sustainable filter media. Therefore, this review has proven that the relatively inexpensive and renewable resources from the agro-industrial wastes can remove pollutants efficiently from the stormwater. Four main criteria affecting filter media performances are also highlighted, including the grain sizes of the media, media bed configuration, hydraulic loading rate, and the suspended solids concentration. Further study on these variables can be beneficial to explore the impact of utilizing agro-based media in stormwater filtration.

AB  - This case study examines the translation of evidence on the effectiveness of laws to reduce the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of drivers into policy. It was reconstructed through discussions among individuals involved in the processes as well as a review of documentation and feedback on oral presentations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated extensively with federal and non-federal partners and stakeholders in conducting a rigorous systematic review, using the processes of the Guide to Community Preventive Services to evaluate the body of empirical evidence on 0.08% BAC laws. The timely dissemination of the findings and related policy recommendations-made by the independent Task Force on Community Preventive Services-to Congress very likely contributed to the inclusion of strong incentives to States to adopt 0.08 BAC laws by October 2003. Subsequent dissemination to partners and stakeholders informed decision-making about support for state legislative and policy action. This case study suggests the value of: clearly outlining the relationships between health problems, interventions and outcomes; systematically assessing and synthesizing the evidence; using a credible group and rigorous process to assess the evidence; having an impartial body make specific policy recommendations on the basis of the evidence; being ready to capitalize in briefly opening policy windows; engaging key partners and stakeholders throughout the production and dissemination of the evidence and recommendations; undertaking personalized, targeted and compelling dissemination of the evidence and recommendations; involving multiple stakeholders in encouraging uptake and adherence of policy recommendations; and addressing sustainability. These lessons learned may help others working to translate evidence into policy. Ann Epidemiol 2010;20:412-420. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With the economic progress and scientific development since the 1980s, research on deserts in China has advanced remarkably. Many research outputs have been published, especially in recent years. However, a systematic review and quantitative analysis of these publications has been lacking. Here, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the main deserts in China in order to characterize the trends and temporal changes in publications. Because the first publication was found in 1986, we searched all publications from 1986 to 2020. We found that annual publication output increased exponentially, especially after 2012, and that the Tengger Desert, the Taklimakan Desert, and the Horqin Sandy Land were the most intensively studied areas. Earth science, involving environmental science and ecology, geology, and agriculture were the major research fields. In addition, Journal of Arid Land, Chinese Science Bulletin, and Catena were the journals with the largest number of publications. The Chinese Academy of Sciences produced the largest number of publications, wherein, Li X R, Zhao X Y, and Zhang Y M were the three most productive authors. Noticeably, "climate change" has become a frequent topic since 2010, indicating that more attention has been paid to climate change and alleviating anthropogenic disturbances in desert areas in China. Although Chinese authors contributed the most publications, the average number of citations per publication for Chinese authors was relatively low. Our results highlight that authors should continue to improve the number of citations of their publications and pay more attention to the interactions between climate change and desertification in the deserts research of Northern China in the futures.

AB  - The increasing amount of plastic waste generated each year, fuelled by the growing consumption of single-use plastics in food packaging applications, threatens the integrity of our ecosystems while creating an unprecedented waste management crisis. The biodegradable properties of some bioplastics have been identified as a promising solution to divert food and food packaging waste from landfill while avoiding plastic leaking into the environment. However, such bio-based biodegradable alternatives may not necessarily provide an improvement in overall environmental impact, especially when considering their efficacy at preventing food waste. This is the first systematic review to investigate the relationship between food packaging and food waste, based on conventional and biodegradable plastic food packaging life-cycle assessments (LCAs). It focuses on the trade-offs that may occur between food packaging production, end-of-life management and food waste prevention across the entire food packaging life-cycle. Following a review of 111 papers, 19 were identified for further investigation and data extraction. Quantitative analysis for five LCA impact categories, as well as hotspot analysis and end-of-life scenario analysis for global warming potential were conducted. The resulting picture is conflicting and suggests that though bioplastics display environmental benefits for global warming potential and non-renewable energy use, these are often negated by the agricultural inputs required for bioplastics raw material production. While the LCAs included in this study do not provide enough evidence to state which polymer is best at reducing food waste, they emphasise the environmental footprint associated with food production and food waste, and highlight the importance of including the food itself in food packaging LCAs. Therefore, focusing on food packaging performance in food waste minimisation is critical. We found that bioplastics provide the benefit of diverting biodegradable waste from landfill or incineration to 'greener' streams such as anaerobic digestion and composting, contributing to a circular economy. Encouraging biodegradable bioplastics should target plastic packaging where effective recycling measures are failing due to the challenges that remain for treating and recycling materials made of multiple, highly food-contaminated layers. The bioplastic industry is still young and optimising both the manufacturing process and material biophysical properties would contribute towards improving the overall environmental profiles of bioplastics.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used in the modeling, design and prediction in energy systems. During the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the advancement and application of various types of ML models for energy systems. This paper presents the state of the art of ML models used in energy systems along with a novel taxonomy of models and applications. Through a novel methodology, ML models are identified and further classified according to the ML modeling technique, energy type, and application area. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature leads to an assessment and performance evaluation of the ML models and their applications, and a discussion of the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research. This paper further concludes that there is an outstanding rise in the accuracy, robustness, precision and generalization ability of the ML models in energy systems using hybrid ML models. Hybridization is reported to be effective in the advancement of prediction models, particularly for renewable energy systems, e.g., solar energy, wind energy, and biofuels. Moreover, the energy demand prediction using hybrid models of ML have highly contributed to the energy efficiency and therefore energy governance and sustainability.

AB  - The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will play an essential role in boosting the world's economy. However, the main portion of the Belt and Road (B&R) is in arid, semi-arid, or sub-humid fragile ecological regions, which with global climate change and the intensification of human activities will face many pressing environmental challenges in the future. Despite this, in the existing research on the B&R, papers in the field of natural sciences are less than 1.2-4.3% of the total number of papers on the main databases, which is far lower than the coverage in humanities and social sciences. And those focused on the ecological and environmental issues along the B&R are even fewer, so necessary understanding of both the risks and adequate mitigation measures remains unclear. This paper systematically reviews the relevant research on the eco-environments along the B&R, and summarizes it in terms including of spatial patterns and cognition, cost efficiency and evaluation, ecological security and evaluation, ecological footprint and carrying capacity. It further suggests that a better understanding of environmental changes and their effects on the B&R is needed. Additionally, it is essential that the potential positive socio-economic impacts for the future under the BRI are sustainable. Finally, future research directions are proposed to improve for the better eco-environments in B&R regions with consideration of global changes.

AB  - Genetics tools are used in applied conservation management for taxonomic identification, delineation of management units, management of wild populations, captive breeding and reintroduction and control of invasive species, disease and hybridisation. To assess the extent to which genetic tools are being used for applied conservation management, we conducted a systematic literature review of over 53,767 papers focussing on wildlife research that reported results on species delineation, translocations and population augmentation. We synthesised information on papers that used genetics tools in an expressly applied manner across all wildlife species. We found that the application of genetics tools in conservation management was biased towards fishes, mammals and birds and northern hemisphere locations, especially the United States and Europe. Despite genetics tools being a highly published topic, it was difficult to find published applications of these tools in both the primary and the grey literature. Of the 115 papers on 152 species that could be considered an applied use of a genetics tool expressly for conservation management, only 49 had definable applied outcomes. The remaining 66 made recommendations, but it was often unclear if the recommendations were ever used to make conservation management decisions because of the time-lag between publication of the initial recommendation and publication of the results of the use of the tool in a conservation management situation, as well as the lack of dissemination in the primary literature. Our study highlights the relative low publication rate of applications of genetics tools compared to the general conservation genetics field. These tools appear to have either a low percentage of translations into publication ('conservation genetics publishing gap') or a poor uptake among wildlife conservation managers ('conservation genetics gap')-the two are indistinguishable in this review. Policy implications. Conservation genetics tools must be brought to the forefront of conservation policy and management. Users should support the use of systems and accessible databases to increase the uptake of genetics tools for conservation in applied management decisions for wildlife, reducing barriers to disseminating the results to other end users and interested parties.

AB  - Various studies have shown that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change because of its overreliance on rain-fed agricultural production and that this sphere of production is highly susceptible to the vagaries of weather and climate. Climate change impacts on agricultural production ranges from low outputs to fluctuations in market supply and the price of food commodities. In this study, various works of literature were systematically reviewed to highlight the trends in climate change in SSA and its impact on agricultural production. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change in this region are already significant, as evidenced in the average temperature and rainfall fluctuations, as well as in the intensity of extreme weather events. Additionally, climate change is proving to be unpredictable, with its severity being reflected in the limited scale of agricultural production in SSA. Ascribed to the current manifestations of climate change, agricultural production is being affected by the prospect of reduced yields, attributed to the relatively shorter length of the growing season, which affects the availability, accessibility, and price of food products. This review also sets out to verify the widespread belief that SSA is the region most severely affected by climate change. It confirms the fact that in order to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability, policymakers should prioritize the development and implementation of specific policies/programmes concerning adaptation strategies and promotions in the farming industry in an overall attempt to mitigate the effects of climate change. Consequenlty, strengthening the resilience of agricultural production techniques, improving human adaptability, and developing a project-based early warning system for weather reports would be the necessary steps to take.

AB  - Conservation of temperate forest biodiversity has historically focused on natural old-growth. Less than 3% of the world's temperate forests remain unmodified by humans, however, and much of temperate-forest biodiversity is held in the predominating planted and secondary forests. Japan provides a widely applicable model for examining how to maximize biodiversity in managed temperate forests, because of its richness of forestry research generated from its vast forest area, albeit largely in Japanese, and the wide practice of its dominant management interventions across the northern temperate zone. Management for plantations includes thinning, extended rotation cycles and clear-cutting. For secondary forests regenerating from past clearance, traditional management varies in its intensities, from clear-cutting as coppices to small-scale under-story clearance. Here we provide a first synthesis of published research on biodiversity in planted and secondary forests of Japan, relevant to management of these types of forest in northern temperate regions. Systematic review and meta-analyses of papers published in English and Japanese quantified management impacts on species richness and abundance of several taxa, in relation to moderator variables including stand age and management intensity. Plantation thinning substantially increases the richness and abundance of several taxa. Effect sizes decline with time since thinning for the abundance of regenerating saplings and seedlings, necessitating repeated thinning treatments every 6 years to sustain this positive effect. Taxonomic groups exhibit variable relationships with stand age in both planted and secondary forests, indicating a need to include both young and old forest stands in managed forest mosaics. We find an insufficient evidence base is available to allow for a meaningful synthesis of low-intensity management effects in historically managed secondary forests, with studies varying widely in scale and reported outcomes. We outline an agenda for the research community to achieve a systematic evaluation of scale-dependent effects of traditional forest management on biodiversity.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, scholars have been calling for modern management theory and research to consider how strategic management tools could be applied to enhance corporate sustainability. While strategic management for sustainability has emerged as a multidisciplinary field, the existing knowledge base has yet to be systematic reviewed. This paper responded to the literature gap by conducting a bibliometric review of strategic management for sustainability. The paper aimed to document the landscape and composition of this literature through the analysis of 988 relevant Scopus-indexed documents. Data analyses found that the strategic management for sustainability knowledge base remained an emergent field with increasing interests from diverse groups of international scholars in various fields, particularly in environmental science, engineering, and strategic business management. Over the past three decades, the literatures have been continuously grown from a few publications in the early 1990s to almost 1000 documents to date. The review found that the most influential journals and authors of this knowledge base were international in scope but predominately from Western developed countries. Five Schools of Thought from author co-citation analysis revealed the intellectual clustering composition of the knowledge base on strategic management for sustainability: corporate sustainability strategy, sustainable waste management, strategic sustainability systems, strategic sustainability management and entrepreneurship, and sustainability assessment strategy. Key topics addressed in this research include the distribution of documents across the most highly cited journals, reflecting the breadth, quality and influential scholars in the strategic management for sustainability knowledge domain, naming of the influential scholars in the field and identification of contemporary foci and research front in the existing literature through the keyword co-occurrence analysis and co-word map. The strategic management for sustainability field has evolved from the key topics related to the green movement at the policy-driven macro level (i.e., ecological or environmental protection/impact, water/waste management and natural resource conservation) to the practicality in organizations with the topics related to social strategic responsibility and business management issues (i.e., corporate strategy, project management, supply chain management, information management, adaptive management, corporate sustainability). In addition to a retrospective, insightful prospective interpretation, practical implication, limitations and future research direction are discussed.

AB  - The parametric uncertainties inherent in the models of renewable and sustainable energy systems (RSESs) make the associated decision-making processes of integrated resource operation, planning, and designing profoundly complex. Accordingly, intelligent energy management strategies are recognised as an effective intervention to efficiently accommodate the variability inherent in various input data and integrate distributed demand-side flexibility resources. To identify the key methodological and content gaps in the area of stochastic dispatch and planning optimisation of RSESs in the presence of responsive loads, this paper systematically reviews and synthetically analyses 252 relevant peer-reviewed academic articles. The review reveals that academic studies have utilised a wide variety of methods for the joint quantification of uncertainties and procurement of demand response services, while optimally designing and scheduling RSESs. However, to minimise simulation-to-reality gaps, research is needed into more integrated energy optimisation models that simultaneously characterise a broader spectrum of problem-inherent uncertainties and make behaviourally-founded use of flexible demand-side resources. More specifically, the review finds that while the research in this area is rich in thematic scope, it is commonly associated with strong simplifying assumptions that disconnect the corresponding ap-proaches from reality, and thereby obscure the real challenges of transferring simulations into the real world. Accordingly, based on the descriptive analyses conducted and knowledge gaps identified, the paper provides useful insights into myriad possibilities for new research to more effectively utilise the potential of responsive loads, whilst simultaneously characterising the most salient problem-inherent parametric sources of uncertainty, during the investment planning and operational phases of RSESs.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is replete with significant environmental resources including forests, water, land, and energy; although its transition to a bio-resource economy is yet to be actualized. Consequently, there are limited socio-economic gains from resource valorization. These challenges which stall progress towards the attainment of several interlinked sustainable development goals, are rooted, among others in resource governance defects. Furthermore, the persistence of knowledge fragmentation on resource governance shades possibilities for an in-depth theorizing of the nexus approach. In this light, two questions beg for answers: (i) To what extent are governance indicators captured in empirical studies on the nexus approach in SSA? (ii) What questions and approaches should inform future research on the nexus approach in SSA? To answer these questions, this paper systematically reviews 100 peer-reviewed articles (with 154 cases) that address governance questions in nexus studies within the broad framework of bioeconomy transitioning in SSA. Using the PROFOR analytical framework, our analysis reveals the following: (1) Although sub-regional variations exist in the application of nexus thinking, the overall emphasis in SSA is on first-level resource transformation. (2) With only 5% of studies explicitly mentioning the nexus approach, there is a strong indication for nexus thinking to be prioritized in future research. (3) While efficiency is the most recurrent in the literature (69%), its assurance in resource nexus and transformation is insignificant. (4) Interlinked questions of equity, participation, transparency, and conflict management have not been sufficiently addressed in studies on the nexus approach. The paper suggests an urgent need for in-depth, multi-country, and interdisciplinary research on these governance parameters in the nexus approach, as prerequisite to advancing the science-policy intercourse in nexus thinking in SSA.

AB  - There are several barriers to increased use of biofuel in the transport sector (e.g., shortage of feedstocks, high production costs, and relatively low energy yields from standalone biofuel plants). One possible solution is integration of biofuel and district heating (DH) production. This study aims (1) to identify challenges (e.g. tradeoffs) related to integration and to suggests possible ways of dealing with these challenges, (2) to highlight factors that may influence effects on global GHG emissions from integration, (3) to highlight factors which should be considered when evaluating economic aspects related to integration. After conducting a systematic review using a prescribed and structured protocol, 38 articles were identified as relevant for this study. These articles present four different approaches for integration: delivering the excess heat from biorefineries to DH networks, utilising DH in biofuel production processes, integrating biofuel production with existing DH facilities, and building new polygeneration biofuel production facilities in DH systems (DHS).If investments in biofuel compete with combined heat and power (CHP) production, the electricity price and the premium paid for renewable electricity influence profitability in CHP plants investments and therefore even profitability in investments in biofuel production. Competition should also be considered when weighing environmental benefits (the influence on global GHG emissions). Competition can create trade-offs related to DHS's operating conditions, limited local and global biomass availability, and limited available heat sinks. To deal with these trade-offs and to avoid suboptimization, stakeholders in regional planning, investors and policymakers should cooperate.All identified studies noted that a comprehensive approach is needed to evaluate profitability aspects and effects on global GHG emissions.For instance, utilising excess heat or residues from a biofuel production process in a DHS requires consideration of alternative DH production and alternative fuels. If electricity is one of the by-products from the biofuel production, alternative electricity production should also be considered. The majority of the studies dealt with economic performance of integration. Some of the factors found to influence profitability include available heat sink, alternative DH and electricity production, expected operation patterns, energy policy and energy market conditions. The potential for reducing global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions depends on alternative DH and electricity production but also on biomass availability and alternative biomass users.

AB  - Key messageAbove 40 degrees N/S, increasing latitude is linked to greater post-fire tree regeneration. However, species dominance shifts from conifers to short-lived deciduous trees, which may negatively impact flora, fauna, and ecosystem services dependent on coniferous forests. These results were primarily driven by studies from North America, highlighting the need for more research that directly measures post-fire forest recovery in other high-latitude regions.ContextAs the size and frequency of wildfires increase across many regions, high-latitude forests may be at particular risk for decreases in regeneration and state shifts post-fire.AimsThrough this systematic review, we sought to determine the general relationship between post-fire tree regeneration densities and latitude in forests above 40 degrees N/S. We expected regeneration densities post-fire would decrease with increasing latitude, and that forest regeneration would be negatively impacted by high burn severities, forest management, harsh site conditions, and unprotected microsites. We also anticipated that light-demanding species with adaptations to fire would replace shade-tolerant species that lack such adaptations post-fire.MethodsWe conducted a literature search that returned over 4500 articles. We selected those that directly measured post-fire regeneration at or above 40 degrees N/S and retained 93 articles for analysis. Fire characteristics, pre- and post-fire tree species compositions and regeneration densities, and regeneration predictors were then extracted from the retained articles. We fit linear mixed models to post-fire regeneration density with latitude and species traits as explanatory variables and also explored the significance and magnitude of predictors that informed post-fire tree species response.ResultsContrary to our expectations, post-fire regeneration increased significantly with latitude. High burn severities and unprotected microsites had negative impacts on post-fire regeneration; higher elevations and more prolific pre- or post-fire reproduction were positively correlated with post-fire regeneration, while management of any type did not have an impact.ConclusionAlthough forests are regenerating after wildfires at the most extreme latitudes included in this study (above 55 degrees N), regeneration is often limited to only a handful of genera: aspen (Populus) and birch (Betula), for example. Regeneration was less abundant at the lower range of our study area. Certain lower latitude forests that occupy marginal habitats are under increasing stress from drier, warmer conditions that are exacerbated by wildfires. Results were largely driven by studies from Canada and the USA and may not be applicable to all high-latitude forests.

AB  - Land-use restrictions in protected areas (PAs) might have unintended spillover effects on non-target, neighboring areas. In the case of leakage, land-use change that would have occurred in the PA is displaced to an unprotected area where it would not have otherwise occurred. The resultant 'leakages' can offset benefits achieved inside PAs, confound impact assessments, and exacerbate the problems of opportunistic protection of lands. Conversely, in the case of 'blockage', the unprotected surroundings experience less land-use change than would have otherwise occurred due to a positive spillover effect from nearby protected areas. Little is known about the magnitude, ubiquity, and predictability of spillovers that have already occurred in the global PA network. Here we systematically review the literature and collate the existing evidence to quantify deforestation spillovers. We calculated deforestation rates within 3,398 PAs, most of which were found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, and in their unprotected adjacent surroundings and compared these rates to a baseline derived from the wider landscape. Of the 2,575 PAs that effectively restricted deforestation rates within their bounds relative to the baseline, 11.8% showed leakage and 54.8% exhibited blockage. Deforestation rates in the remaining 33.4% were indistinguishable from their respective baselines. Linear modelling of the correlates of leakage and blockage showed that PA-specific characteristics like size and IUCN category were uninformative, whereas national-scale socioeconomic factors like population density and GDP were useful predictors. Although spillovers from land-use restrictions are ultimately driven by socioeconomic factors, their ecological consequences are such that PA assessments should routinely and explicitly account for displaced impacts to the unprotected surroundings.

AB  - Naturalistic plantings, such as meadow-style plantings, can improve the quality of urban green spaces through aesthetic, biodiversity and low maintenance features. Species selection for, and maintenance of naturalistic plantings are key to their success. While herbaceous and grassy meadows can be mowed, naturalistic plantings with woody plants require more intense maintenance to remove biomass and promote resprouting. We aim to understand woody plant responses to diverse disturbance regimes to potentially inform the selection and management of woody species in urban plantings. We conducted a quantitative systematic literature review of 72 papers and investigated what main external (climate, disturbance regime) and internal (buds, life stage, storage reserves) factors influence the resprouting response of woody plants. We found resprouting literature is geographically widespread for woody plants, but studies are skewed towards Temperate climates in USA and Australia, with a focus on high severity and high frequency fire disturbance. Resprouting response was mostly defined as a continuous response to disturbance dependent on disturbance regime, climate and plant traits. Maintenance and management of naturalistic woody plantings, through hard pruning techniques such as coppicing, may be informed by analogous high severity and high frequency disturbance studies. However, the literature on woody plant resprouting has several knowledge gaps for lower severity and lower frequency disturbance regimes and in more arid climates. Future research should evaluate the response of naturalistic woody plantings to disturbance in specific urban contexts.
   We systematically reviewed 72 papers on woody plant resprouting. We assessed the literature to understand how resprouting is researched with disturbance regime, climate, plant life stage, meristematic bud availability and carbohydrate storage reserves. The results of this review have the potential to inform the design and management of urban woody plantings.image

AB  - This study systematically reviews the peer-reviewed literature on livestock production and food security in urbanizing environments of developing countries to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. Specifically, a systematic literature review was undertaken using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases over the period 1980-2017, resulting in a final number of 72 articles meeting our selection criteria. The results revealed a fragmentation in the literature, which draws from a very small number of studies, and is positioned in widely varied research areas, environments, livestock systems and consumption patterns. With such heterogeneity, drawing generalizations from the literature may be unreachable. Furthermore, the literature is largely qualitative in nature, with very few comprehensive models to capture and integrate empirical evidence. Food security was typically found to be narrowly defined, focusing primarily on interlinks with livestock supply. Considerably less attention has been given to other relevant dimensions of food security, such as accessibility, utilization and stability. Another important finding of relevance to food security is a need to address the missing middle in livestock value chains since the literature has customarily concentrated extensively on the two ends of the livestock value chain, i.e., on production and consumption, while widely ignoring other elements and actors along the value chain. A further focus on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security and urbanization in developing countries through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Particularly, future research aiming to understand livestock systems in the context of rapid urbanization should put more emphasis on addressing the full continuum of the livestock value chain and the four dimensions that drive food security in developing countries and how they possibly interrelate.

AB  - Background
   Depression and dementia are common incapacitating diseases in old age. The exact nature of the relationship between these conditions remains unclear, and multiple explanations have been suggested: depressive symptoms may be a risk factor for, a prodromal symptom of, or a coincidental finding in dementia. They may even be unrelated or only connected through common risk factors. Multiple studies so far have provided conflicting results.
   Objectives
   To determine whether a systematic literature review can clarify the nature of the relation between depressive symptoms and dementia.
   Methods
   Using the Patient/Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome or PICO paradigm, a known framework for framing healthcare and evidence questions, we formulated the question "whether depressive symptoms in cognitively intact older adults are associated with a diagnosis of dementia later in life." We performed a systematic literature review of MEDLINE and PsycINFO in November 2018, looking for prospective cohort studies examining the aforementioned question.
   Results
   We critically analyzed and listed 31 relevant papers out of 1,656 and grouped them according to the main hypothesis they support: depressive symptoms as a risk factor, not a risk factor, a prodromal symptom, both, or some specific other hypothesis. All but three studies used clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia alone (i.e., no biomarkers or autopsy confirmation). Several studies contain solid arguments for the hypotheses they support, yet they do not formally contradict other findings or suggested explanations and are heterogeneous.
   Conclusions
   The exact nature of the relationship between depressive symptoms and dementia in the elderly remains inconclusive, with multiple studies supporting both the risk factor and prodromal hypotheses. Some provide arguments for common risk factors. It seems unlikely that there is no connection at all. We conclude that at least in a significant part of the patients, depressive symptoms and dementia are related. This may be due to common risk factors and/or depressive symptoms being a prodromal symptom of dementia and/or depression being a risk factor for dementia. These causal associations possibly overlap in some patients. Further research is warranted to develop predictive biomarkers and to develop interventions that may attenuate the risk of "conversion" from depressive symptoms to dementia in the elderly.

AB  - Increased cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapes has led to human-wildlife conflicts that complicate the relationship between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free-range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a 'buffer zone' to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti-rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest-cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a remarkable surge in the development and research of tethered aerial systems, thus reflecting a growing interest in their diverse applications. Long-term missions involving aerial vehicles present significant challenges due to the limitations of current battery solutions. Tethered vehicles can circumvent such restrictions by receiving their power from an element on the ground such as a ground station or a mobile terrestrial platform. Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can also be applied to load transportation achieved by a single or multiple UAVs. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, with a special focus on solutions published in the last five years (2017-2022). It emphasizes the key characteristics that are capable of grouping publications by application scope, propulsion method, energy transfer solution, perception sensors, and control techniques adopted. The search was performed in six different databases, thereby resulting in 1172 unique publications, from which 182 were considered for inclusion in the data extraction phase of this review. Among the various aircraft types, multirotors emerged as the most widely used category. We also identified significant variations in the application scope of tethered UAVs, thus leading to tailored approaches for each use case, such as the fixed-wing model being predominant in the wind generation application and the lighter-than-air aircraft in the meteorology field. Notably, the classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control scheme emerged as the predominant control methodology across the surveyed publications. Regarding energy transfer techniques, most publications did not explicitly describe their approach. However, among those that did, high-voltage DC energy transfer emerged as the preferred solution. In summary, this systematic literature review provides valuable insights into the current state of tethered aerial systems, thereby showcasing their potential as a robust and sustainable alternative to address the challenges associated with long-duration aerial missions and load transportation.

AB  - Fisheries are complex adaptive social-ecological systems (SES) that consist of interlinked human and ecosystems. They have mainly been studied by the natural sciences and focused on the ecosystem. However, rising concerns about sustainability and increasing complexity of societal challenges often require an understanding of fisheries in a SES context. For this purpose, the study of the human system should be expanded within fisheries science. Models are currently the most common method used in the field and these need to include the human dimension, alongside the ecosystem, when addressing fisheries systems as SES. The human dimension is an umbrella term for the complex web of human processes and it is captured by disciplines from the social sciences and the humanities. Consequently, capturing and synthesizing the variety of disciplines involved in the human dimension, and integrating them into fisheries models, requires an interdisciplinary approach. This study attempts to assess the presence of the human dimension in fisheries models applied to a European Union context and to evaluate interdisciplinarity within modeled human dimension aspects through a systematic review and qualitative analysis. Within 31 modeling publications, 20 different human dimension aspects could be identified within the categories of social phenomena, social processes, and individual attributes. Most of the human dimension aspects were modeled in an interdisciplinary manner in mathematical, statistical, simulation, or conceptual models. Yet, predominantly through the use of economic and environmental variables. We conclude that there is potential for the expansion of the human dimension and interdisciplinarity in fisheries models. To reach this potential, one should consider early involvement of all relevant disciplines in the formulation of theories, identification of data, and in the model development. We provide recommendations for interdisciplinary model development, communication, and documentation to increase our understanding of fisheries as SES.

AB  - It is challenging to measure the environmental impact of concrete with the absence of a consensus on a standardized methodology for life cycle assessment (LCA). Consequently, the values communicated in the literature for "green" concrete alternatives vary widely between 84 and 612 kg eq CO2/m(3). This does not provide enough evidence regarding the acclaimed environmental benefits compared to ordinary Portland cement concrete knowing that the average for the latter was concluded in this study to be around 370 kg eq CO2/m(3). Thus, the purpose of this study was to survey the literature on concrete LCAs in an attempt to identify the potential sources of discrepancies and propose a potential solution. This was done through examining 146 papers systematically and attributing the sources of error to the four stages of an LCA: scope definition, inventory data, impact assessment and results interpretations. The main findings showed that there are 13 main sources of discrepancies in a concrete LCA that contribute to the incompatibility between the results. These sources varied between (i) user-based choices such as depending on a cradle-to-gate scope, selecting a basic volume-based functional unit and ignoring the impact allocation and (ii) intrinsic uncertainty in some of the elements, such as the means of transportation, the expected service life and fluctuations in market prices. The former affects the reliability of a study, and hence, a concrete LCA methodology should not allow for any of the uncertainties. On the other hand, the latter affects the degree of uncertainty of the final outcome, and hence, we recommended conducting scenario analyses and communicating the aggregated uncertainty through the selected indicators.

AB  - Introduction Civil-military cooperation (CMC) in infectious disease outbreak responses has become more common, and has its own cooperation dynamics. These collaborations fit WHO's call for multisectoral cooperation in managing health emergencies according to the emergency management cycle (EMC). However, the literature on CMC on this topic is fragmented. The core aim of this review is to understand the breadth and dynamics of this cooperation by using the EMC as a framework and by identifying challenges and opportunities in the management of outbreaks. Methods A scoping review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guideline was conducted. A systematic search for peer-reviewed journals was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus. Eligible papers addressed substantive contributions to the understanding of CMC. Papers were categorised by EMC phase and relevant information on study characteristics and areas of cooperation were extracted from the data. Recurring themes on challenges and opportunities in cooperation were identified by means of qualitative interpretation analysis. Results The search resulted in 8360 papers; 54 were included for analysis. Most papers provided a review of activities or expert opinions. CMC was described in all EMC phases, with the fewest references in the recovery phase (n=1). In total, eight areas of CMC were explored. Regarding the better understanding of cooperative dynamics, the qualitative analysis of the papers yielded five recurring themes covering challenges and opportunities in CMC: managing relations, framework conditions, integrating collective activities, governance and civil-military differences. Conclusion Guided by these five themes, successful CMC requires sustainable relations, binding agreements, transparency, a clear operational perspective and acknowledgement of organisational cultural differences. Early and continuous engagement proves crucial to avoid distrust and tension among stakeholders, frequently caused by differences in strategical goals. Original research on this topic is limited.

AB  - Achieving evidence-based environmental management requires that decision-makers have access to evidence that can help identify the most effective interventions for their management context. Evidence synthesis supports evidence-based decision-making because it collates, filters and makes sense of a sometimes large and often conflicting evidence-base, potentially yielding new insights. There are many approaches to evidence synthesis. They each have different strengths and weaknesses, making them suited to different purposes, questions and contexts, given particular constraints. To make sense of the wide array of approaches, we outline the important considerations when selecting the most appropriate method for a particular decision context. These include the purpose for the synthesis, the required outcomes, and the multiple constraints within which decision-makers must operate. We then critically assess a spectrum of approaches to evidence synthesis commonly used within environmental management, detailing the characteristics of each that can be used to determine when it is a suitable method. To guide this selection process we provide a decision tree for those commissioning (e.g., decision-makers or stakeholders) or conducting (e.g., scientists) evidence synthesis, which can be used to identify an appropriate method. The decision tree classifies evidence synthesis methods according to whether their purpose is to test or generate hypotheses, the level of resources they require, the level of certainty in the outputs, and the type and scope of the question being addressed. This tool is a major advance because it helps select an appropriate synthesis method based on the multiple constraints that impact the decision. We conclude that there is an approach to evidence synthesis that will suit all management contexts, but that selecting the right approach requires careful consideration of what is fit for purpose.

AB  - Background Among the most widely anticipated climate-related impacts to biodiversity are geographic range shifts, whereby species shift their spatial distribution in response to changing climate conditions. In particular, a series of commonly articulated hypotheses have emerged: species are expected to shift their distributions to higher latitudes, greater elevations, and deeper depths in response to climate change, reflecting an underlying hypothesis that species will move to cooler locations to track spatial changes in the temperature of their current range. Yet, many species are not demonstrating range shifts consistent with these hypotheses. Resolving this discrepancy and providing effective explanations for the observed variability in species' range shifts is urgently needed to help support a range of natural resource management decisions. Here, we propose a protocol to review the body of evidence for commonly-held climate change range shift hypotheses at the species level focusing on observed latitudinal, longitudinal, elevational, and depth shifts in response to temperature and precipitation changes. We aim to answer the question: what is the impact of anthropogenic climate change (specifically changes in temperature and precipitation) on species ranges? Methods In this review protocol, we propose to conduct a systematic search of literature from internet databases and search engines in English. Articles will be screened in a two-stage process (title/abstract and full text) to evaluate whether they meet a list of eligibility criteria (e.g., presents species-level data, compares > 1 time period). Initial data coding and extraction will be completed by four reviewers and checked by a secondary reviewer from among our co-authors. We will perform a formal meta-analysis to document estimated effect size using the subset of available range-shift data expressed in distance per time (e.g., km/decade). We will also use multinomial logistic regression models to assess the probability that species are shifting in a direction that supports our hypotheses (i.e. towards higher latitudes, greater elevations, and deeper depths). We will account for study methodology as a potential source of variation.

AB  - Household water insecurity (HWI) can have far-reaching consequences for human health and well-being, yet little is known about how environmental seasonality contributes to HWI variation. Using a systematic literature review, we examined the following questions: (1) How does environmental seasonality affect HWI? and (2) How do the effects vary over time? We also highlighted strategic areas for future research. We conducted the search using Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, and EBSCO Academic Search Complete, with an end search date of February 3, 2021; only English-language studies were included. Articles were included in the review if analysis studied seasonal temperature, precipitation, or freshwater variation and individual or household experiences with household water adequacy, water reliability, water affordability, or water safety. Bias was evaluated via hand assessment, and articles of poor quality were excluded. Studies that focused on extreme weather events or water insecurity at community or watershed levels were omitted. We identified 67 articles, the majority of which were cross-sectional (n = 46, 68.7%). Among longitudinal studies (n = 21, 31.3%), only one used a quantitative HWI scale, while the rest relied on proxies (n = 20, 95.2%). Our review also revealed literature gaps related to unequal coverage of freshwater ecosystem habitat types and forms of environmental seasonality. There is a need for more attention to extreme climate events, such as a prolonged multiyear drought. With changing climate expected to exacerbate weather patterns with serious implications, especially for vulnerable populations, understanding seasonality in HWI is important for crafting sustainable engineering and policy responses to water insecurity.

AB  - In the last decade, green solutions for road tunnels have steadily emerged in the field of engineering. The focus has been on using renewable energy sources to conserve energy and address issues of disaster risk management, territorial resilience and vulnerability, especially as these issues relate to critical infrastructures (CIs), such as roads and railways. Focusing on the equilibrium of the infrastructure through integrated system services and their external effects guarantees a better evaluation of both effects as they relate to other systems and energy consumption optimisation. To this end, a systematic literature review has been conducted herein that collects and analyses studies carried out in the last decade that relate to green energy solutions in tunnels. Upon a review of the Scopus database from 2013 to 2022, 46 conceptual and empirical studies were selected. Classifications and discussions were then developed according to the main issues identified (e.g., energy saving in road tunnels, zero-energy tunnels, renewable energy sources, tunnel safety lighting, and sustainable infrastructure). Each contribution constitutes a part of the current literature that combines the problems of tunnel safety (as represented by the energy costs of safety devices, e.g., tunnel lighting systems) with issues of renewable energy sources in tunnels. The results of this systematic review offer ideas for future directions of the 'green' vision for tunnel infrastructure. This study represents the state-of-the-art of renewable energy solutions currently present worldwide. Gaps in the literature that have yet to be addressed include how to build a green system as well as how to balance its life costs. The review supports the claim that the integration of renewable energy sources can exploit innovative solutions related to the concept of resilience.

AB  - Species distribution modelling (SDM) of marine organisms is widely developed for biogeography, ecology and management purposes. However, most studies continue to focus on the Global North, with fewer examples for the Global South. We carried out a bibliometric analysis to characterise aspects of studies conducting SDM for species in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWAO), focusing on the type of input data, taxonomic groups studied, focus of research, methods applied, and international collaboration between countries. Studies on megafauna and fisheries resources, based on presence-only and scenopoetic input data, applying Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and generalized linear/additive models (GLM/GAM) predominate. Models applied to biogeography/current species distribution were the most common, followed by biological invasion. Brazil figures as the most prolific country publishing in SWAO, and has more collaborations with the United States of America, Europe, and South Africa than with its neighbours Uruguay and Argentina, who formed a separate cluster. Research groups based on coauthorship of the 30 most frequent authors seem to be mostly isolated, with only two research groups collaborating to each other. In addition, we fit a Binomial generalised linear model (BGLM) to explore how many predictors (layers) would be sufficient to reach an excellent modelling performance based on Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The BGLM indicated at least 5-8 layers would be necessary to have a 50 % chance of achieving excellent model performance (AUC >= 0.9), but we urge caution regarding this result and briefly discuss it. The literature review was used as a baseline to discuss aspects of our findings and highlight the need to increase SDM application in the SWAO and to strengthen international collaboration between Latin American countries. Finally, we provide recommendations on how researchers could approach some of the gaps we found.

AB  - Universal electricity access is an important development objective, and the focus of a number of key global UN initiatives. While robust electricity planning is widely believed to be a prerequisite for effective electrification, to date, no comprehensive overview of electricity planning research has been undertaken on sub-Saharan Africa, the world region with the lowest access rates. This paper reviews quantitative and qualitative electricity planning and related implementation research, considering each of the 49 sub-Saharan African countries, the four regional power pools and the sub-continent as a whole. Applying a broad understanding of electricity planning and a practical limit of 20 reviewed articles per country and region, 306 relevant peer-reviewed journal articles are included in this review. A general classification scheme is introduced that classifies the planning literature along the addressed value chain depth, number of different analysed criteria and number of evaluated decision alternatives. The literature is found to be strongly clustered in a few countries, with less than 5 identified relevant articles in 36 of the 49 countries. The total amount of articles per year is clearly increasing over time, addressing technology choice, operation, distribution and implementation analyses. Although including different high-level criteria in analysing electricity systems is common, the literature is only starting to use formalised multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools. The review indicates that 63% of relevant articles favour renewable energy technologies for their given problems. Frequently mentioned success factors for electrification in sub-Saharan Africa include adequate policy design, sufficient finance and favourable political conditions. While considerable regional and methodological literature gaps are apparent, the literature in this review identifies a rich and fruitful ground for future research to fill these gaps.

AB  - Water scarcity is a global challenge, yet existing responses are failing to cope with current shocks and stressors, including those attributable to climate change. In sub-Saharan Africa, the impacts of water scarcity threaten livelihoods and wellbeing across the continent and are driving a broad range of adaptive responses. This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target mi-grants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa.

AB  - Background: Social, cultural, and behavioral factors are often potent upstream contributors to maternal, neonatal, and child mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Social autopsy is one method of identifying the impact of such factors, yet it is unclear how social autopsy methods are being used in LMICs.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the most common social autopsy instruments, describe overarching findings across populations and geography, and identify gaps in the existing social autopsy literature.
   Methods: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature from 2005 to 2016 was conducted. Studies were included if they were conducted in an LMIC, focused on maternal/neonatal/infant/child health, reported on the results of original research, and explicitly mentioned the use of a social autopsy tool.
   Results: Sixteen articles out of 1950 citations were included, representing research conducted in 11 countries. Five different tools were described, with two primary conceptual frameworks used to guide analysis: Pathway to Survival and Three Delays models. Studies varied in methods for identifying deaths, and recall periods for respondents ranged from 6 weeks to 5+ years. Across studies, recognition of danger signs appeared to be high, while subsequent care-seeking was inconsistent. Cost, distance to facility, and transportation issues were frequently cited barriers to care-seeking, however, additional barriers were reported that varied by location. Gaps in the social autopsy literature include the lack of: harmonized tools and analytical methods that allow for cross-study comparisons, discussion of complexity of decision making for care seeking, qualitative narratives that address inconsistencies in responses, and the explicit inclusion of perspectives from husbands and fathers.
   Conclusion: Despite the nascence of the field, research across 11 countries has included social autopsy methods, using a variety of tools, sampling methods, and analytical frameworks to determine how social factors impact maternal, neonatal, and child health outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To classify features of effective violence prevention programs for 7- to 14-year-olds according to children's risk groups and targeted behaviors.
   Data Sources: Articles published between 1980 and 1999 were identified via electronic databases (MEDLINE, ERIC, PsychINFO) using the key words violence, violence prevention, youth violence, or aggressive behavior. Reference lists were hand-searched for additional publications.
   Study Selection: One hundred fifty- three articles were reviewed with a modified scale by one of the principal. investigators/authors (W,O.C. or M.L.) and a research assistant (K.F.); the other principal investigator resolved any discrepancies. Articles were included if they reported prevention efforts in 7- to 14-year-olds and compared outcome measures, met requirements for scientific rigor, and reported significant improvements (effect size, >0.1 or P less than or equal to .05). Sixty-seven percent (n= 102) did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 51 articles (33%), 38 met requirements for scientific rigor, and 32 articles describing 25 programs reported significant improvements in at least 1 area.
   Results: Twenty-five programs indicated significant improvements in attitudes, knowledge, or intentions (n= 10) and/or reduction in delinquency rates and violent and/or aggressive behavior (n=11);significant changes in both types of outcomes were indicated in 4 programs. Most programs (n=13) targeted older children (aged 11-14 years) and focused on fighting (n=13) and conflict management (n= 14). Classroom teaching was the most common process (n=18) used. Few programs (n=7) involved family intervention.
   Conclusions: Although limited in number, effective youth violence prevention programs were identified from current literature. Study findings were compiled into a database outlining effective processes for specific sociodemographic and risk behavior groups that will be helpful to future program planning.

AB  - Carbon neutrality, or "net zero", has become the impact assessment project of human impact on Earth, increasingly structured to examine the implications, for the environment and people, of proposed actions and consequences of inaction. International and local collaboration efforts have been made with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality or "net-zero" emissions; thus, policies and technological innovations have been developed. Such impact-oriented risk assessment and control efforts amount to carbon-neutral pathways. Although such pathways may diverge in terms of energy, resources, and cost, it is critical to summarize essential and promising preparatory work on related policies and technologies to inform both policy-makers and social scientists to take actions. Through a scientometric analysis and systematic review of the latest social science literature, the study identified the size, scope and exemplar work for each social science discipline on carbon neutrality, based on 907 articles collected in early 2021 from the Web of Science database. This study reveals a set of disciplines focusing on certain common and distinct aspects of carbon neutrality. By outlining the possibilities and application areas for future research and policy development for socio-technical transition towards a net-zero or post-carbon future, this study has contributed to the understanding of the global efforts to achieve a clearer and viable carbon-neutral pathway. In conclusion, as many aspects of the planet and humans have become datafied, digitized, and networked, carbon neutrality, as the ecological indicator that guide human production and consumption patterns, must take on a central role in guiding our conscious green digital transformation of many political, economic, social and psychological aspects of our societies according to the existing and emerging social science knowledge.</p>

AB  - Purpose Preserving the environment is fundamental to the planet's long-term sustainability, but attempts to promote pro-environmental behaviours often do not take into account the motivational determinants of such behaviours. This study aims to present and critically evaluate the theoretical and empirical basis of goal-framing theory, which asserts that pro-environmental behaviours might stem from conflicting goals. This study compares the theory to other approaches used to explain pro-environmental behaviour, reviews the empirical evidence for it and comes up with suggestions for future research. Design/methodology/approach This study compares the theory with other popular theories to explain pro-environmental behaviour and behaviour change and systematically review 25 empirical research studies that adopt the goal-framing theory. Findings Most studies rely on survey data, focus on Europe and gather self-reported behaviours or hypothetical responses. Furthermore, many studies of goal frames neglect key situational factors. Thus, the directions for further research outlined herein emphasise the need for more experimental studies of real behaviours, with consideration of situational factors, using methods that can explicate unconscious processes too. Overall, goal-framing theory provides a promising approach for analysing pro-environmental behaviours, in that it explicitly deals with goal conflicts, takes situational factors into account and encompasses conscious and unconscious processes. The authors conclude that the theory can form a useful basis for the design of social marketing behavioural interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, as the first systematic review of empirical applications of goal-framing theory, this study provides refinement and validation. By also offering propositions and a research agenda, the authors hope to inspire researchers in social marketing to address the remaining gaps and refine the theory even further.

AB  - Aims and objectives This systematic review provides an overview of the literature published on Releasing Time to Care: The Productive Ward between 2005 and June 2011. Background Releasing Time to Care: The Productive Ward programme was developed by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and launched in England in 2007. The programme comprises thirteen modules that aim to increase time for direct patient care, improve the patient and staff experience and make changes to the ward environment to improve efficiency. Design A systematic literature review. Methods The terms Releasing Time to Care' and Productive Ward' were applied to key healthcare databases; CINAHL, Medline, Science Direct, ProQuest, Health Business Elite, British Nursing Index, Embase, Health Management Information Consortium and PsychInfo. All papers were read and subject to a quality assessment. Results The literature search identified 95 unique sources. A lack of research on The Productive Ward programme meant it was necessary to include non-empirical literature. In total, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. Seven key themes were identified: the patient and staff experience, direct care time, patient safety, financial impact, embedding and sustainability, executive support and leadership, and common barriers and determinants of success. It also highlighted areas that require further exploration such as long-term sustainability of the programme and consistent data measurement between organisations. Conclusion The review tentatively reports how The Productive Ward programme has been used to transform nursing practice for the benefit of patients and frontline staff, and how it resulted in cost savings. The literature review identified a potential positive results bias in the current literature whereby favourable outcomes were reported. Relevance to clinical practice This paper summarises the types of evidence and current literature on The Productive Ward providing a reference for frontline staff implementing the programme.

AB  - Background: Visual analytics (VA) promotes the understanding of data using visual, interactive techniques and using analytic and visual engines. The analytic engine includes machine learning and other automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hotspots for studying service gaps and disease distribution. The principal objective of this scoping review is to examine the state of science on VA and the various tools, strategies, and frameworks used in population health and health services research (HSR).
   Objective: The purpose of this scoping review is to develop an overarching global view of established techniques, frameworks, and methods of VA in population health and HSR. The main objectives are to explore, map, and synthesize the literature related to VA in its application to the two main focus areas of health care.
   Methods: We will use established scoping review methods to meet the study objective. As the use of the term visual analytics is inconsistent, one of the major challenges was operationalizing the concepts for developing the search strategy, based on the three main concepts of population health, HSR, and VA. We included peer reviewed and grey literature sources from 2005 till March 2019 in the search. Independent teams of researchers will screen the titles, abstracts and full text articles, whereas an independent researcher will arbiter conflicts. Data will be abstracted and presented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and explanation by two independent researchers.
   Results: As of late August 2019, the scoping review is in the full-text screening stage. Data synthesis will follow and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in December 2019. In this protocol, the methods for undertaking this scoping review are detailed. We present how we operationalized the varied concepts of population health, health services, and VA. The main results of the scoping review will synthesize peer reviewed and grey literature sources on the main methods of VA in the interrelated fields of population health and health services research from January 2005 till March 2019.
   Conclusions: VA is being increasingly used and integrated with emerging technologies to support decision making using large data sets. This scoping review of the VA tools, strategies, and frameworks applied to population health and health services aims to increase awareness of this approach for uptake by decision makers working within and toward developing learning health systems globally.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies are expected to help transform current agricultural systems towards sustainability. To enable and steer transformation we need to understand the mechanisms of adoption and diffusion holistically. Our current understanding is mainly informed by empirical farm level adoption studies and by agent-based models simulating systemic diffusion mechanisms. These two approaches are weakly integrated.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to build an empirically grounded conceptual framework for adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies by synthesizing literature on these alternative approaches.
   METHODS: We review 32 empirical farm-level studies on the adoption of precision and digital farming technologies and 27 agent-based models on the diffusion of agricultural innovations. Empirical findings are synthesized in terms of significance and partially standardized coefficients, and diffusion studies are categorized by their approaches and theoretical frameworks.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We show that farm-level studies focus on farm and operator characteristics but pay less attention to attributes of technology, interactions, institutional and psychological factors. Agent-based models, despite their usefulness for representing system interaction, only loosely connect with empirical farm level findings. Based on the identified gaps, we develop a conceptual framework integrating farm-level evidence on adoption with a systemic perspective on technology diffusion.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Our empirically grounded conceptual framework is the first holistic approach to connect the dots between the wealth of empirical research on technology adoption with more model-driven investigation of innovation diffusion in agent-based studies. Focusing on digital farming technologies, it may serve as a reference for those studying the adoption and diffusion of such technologies beyond farm scale. Furthermore, this framework can be the basis for contextual applications to inform policy-makers trying to foster the diffusion of suitable digital technologies through interventions as it highlights where policy can impact important aspects of adoption via relevant processes of diffusion.

AB  - Purpose The paper contributes to the S-LCA impact assessment by understanding its maturity level to identify each characterization model's good practices and limitations.Method Our research analyzes the S-LCIA type II (impact pathway) models' current state of the art through a systematic review. To this end, we identified publications through international databases without period restriction up to 2020. Gray literature, theoretical propositions, and papers covering solely case studies of former developed models were not included. Among the 102 papers identified, only 14 papers presented type II modeling. These models were evaluated considering the following criteria and sub-criteria: (i) scope coverage (contextualization, time lag, and data level), (ii) scientific robustness (presentation of cause-and-effect chain, transparency, and accessibility), and (iii) characterization factor (CF) (existence, feasibility of regionalized CFs, and presence of uncertainty or sensitivity analysis). Each criterion is composed of sub-criteria related to desirable characteristics. We classified models on scales comprising two or three levels for each sub-criterion.Results and discussion We noticed some models need to provide clear cause-and-effect chains, relationships with social sciences, and measurement models are not always explicit. Most of them do not present ready-to-use characterization factors, and only a few models consider the time lag between cause and effect. Finally, several models are not always connected to company data. Based on the results, we provide recommendations for impact modeling in S-LCIA to support life cycle social and sustainability assessment.Conclusions Despite advances in S-LCIA impact pathway modeling, there are necessary improvements to support S-LCA. We identified good practices, but no model presents all characteristics. Even if the criteria proposed to evaluate the type II models are only partially comprehensive, this framework supports S-LCIA model development by listing desirable characteristics and recommended good practices. We advise (i) including the model's usage limitations, (ii) using time series analysis to include the time lag between cause and effect or to inform if the effect is immediate, (iii) and using company or sector data to develop the characterization factors. The characterization models with links to social sciences, the cause-effect chain, and the reproducibility of the measurement model can improve the models' clarity. At last, providing contextualized CFs would support mainstream S-LCA.

AB  - Life cycle-based methodologies are gaining increasing consensus as a tool to support the transition towards sustainable production and consumption patterns. Despite its potential, Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is the least applied, also given the lower consideration of the social dimension of sustainability in the agri-food sector. The present study aims to outline the state of the art of S-LCA within the sector by identifying the main issues regarding its known strengths and weaknesses to provide some considerations for its future implementation. A systematic literature review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. The selected S-LCA studies were analysed based on criteria identified according to the research questions, the known weaknesses and strengths of S-LCA and the specificities of the agri-food sector. The obtained results confirmed S-LCA to be a methodology still evolving that has been increasingly applied, even if affected by some criticalities already identified in S-LCA literature. Among them, there are those related to the lack of data, the system boundary and the cut-off criteria definition, the impact assessment methods, the absence of defined and shared criteria for selecting stakeholders, subcategories and indicators. On the other hand, some emerged critical issues are closely related to the analysed sector's specificities and complexity, such as the product's multifunctionality, the multiplicity of the involved stakeholders and their peculiarities, the link between the products and the territory. Therefore, a greater effort would be desirable in justifying fundamental methodological choices as well as in empathising the special characteristics of the products, the social themes and the involved stakeholders. The new S-LCA Guidelines can be a useful starting point to face these challenges.

AB  - The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide guide-posts to society as it attempts to respond to an array of pressing challenges. One of these challenges is energy; thus, the SDGs have become paramount for energy policy-making. Yet, while governments throughout the world have already declared the SDGs to be 'integrated and indivisible', there are still knowledge gaps surrounding how the interactions between the energy SDG targets and those of the non-energy-focused SDGs might play out in different contexts. In this review, we report on a large-scale assessment of the relevant energy literature, which we conducted to better our understanding of key energy-related interactions between SDGs, as well as their context-dependencies (relating to time, geography, governance, technology, and directionality). By (i) evaluating the nature and strength of the interactions identified, (ii) indicating the robustness of the evidence base, the agreement of that evidence, and our confidence in it, and (iii) highlighting critical areas where better understanding is needed or context dependencies should be considered, our review points to potential ways forward for both the policy making and scientific communities. First, we find that positive interactions between the SDGs outweigh the negative ones, both in number and magnitude. Second, of relevance for the scientific community, in order to fill knowledge gaps in critical areas, there is an urgent need for interdisciplinary research geared toward developing new data, scientific tools, and fresh perspectives. Third, of relevance for policy-making, wider efforts to promote policy coherence and integrated assessments are required to address potential policy spillovers across sectors, sustainability domains, and geographic and temporal boundaries. The task of conducting comprehensive science-to-policy assessments covering all SDGs, such as for the UN's Global Sustainable Development Report, remains manageable pending the availability of systematic reviews focusing on a limited number of SDG dimensions in each case.

AB  - Background: Community capability is the combined influence of a community's social systems and collective resources that can address community problems and broaden community opportunities. We frame it as consisting of three domains that together support community empowerment: what communities have; how communities act; and for whom communities act. We sought to further understand these domains through a secondary analysis of a previous systematic review on community participation in health systems interventions in low and middle income countries (LMICs).
   Methods: We searched for journal articles published between 2000 and 2012 related to the concepts of "community", "capability/participation", "health systems research" and "LMIC." We identified 64 with rich accounts of community participation involving service delivery and governance in health systems research for thematic analysis following the three domains framing community capability.
   Results: When considering what communities have, articles reported external linkages as the most frequently gained resource, especially when partnerships resulted in more community power over the intervention. In contrast, financial assets were the least mentioned, despite their importance for sustainability. With how communities act, articles discussed challenges of ensuring inclusive participation and detailed strategies to improve inclusiveness. Very little was reported about strengthening community cohesiveness and collective efficacy despite their importance in community initiatives. When reviewing for whom communities act, the importance of strong local leadership was mentioned frequently, while conflict resolution strategies and skills were rarely discussed.
   Synergies were found across these elements of community capability, with tangible success in one area leading to positive changes in another. Access to information and opportunities to develop skills were crucial to community participation, critical thinking, problem solving and ownership. Although there are many quantitative scales measuring community capability, health systems research engaged with community participation has rarely made use of these tools or the concepts informing them. Overall, the amount of information related to elements of community capability reported by these articles was low and often of poor quality.
   Conclusions: Strengthening community capability is critical to ensuring that community participation leads to genuine empowerment. Our simpler framework to define community capability may help researchers better recognize, support and assess it.

AB  - NGOs are expected by their social mission not only to assess but to report on sustainability issues in response to the growing public awareness of the sustainability agendas. Since NGOs are globally renowned as watchdogs for advancing socio-economic development and sustainable societies, research on their efforts in this regard will help develop recommendations on how they can be better positioned as the watchdog. The purpose of this article is to review and assess the understanding of sustainability (reporting) in NGO literature as well as the barriers and drivers. The study investigates various practices of sustainability and identifies the drivers and barriers in sustainability reporting (SR). The authors reviewed 61 articles published between 2010 and 2020 on sustainability and assessed the strengths and weaknesses in the understanding of sustainability in literature as well as the reporting phenomenon in NGOs. The misconceptions in the definition of SR tend to weaken its relevance and applicability, and the reporting process is often focused on demonstrating the legitimacy of NGOs rather than improving their performance. As such, it provides more evidence in support of the need for a more holistic and all-inclusive definition that will aid regulation and enforcement. We also found that, although it is often assumed all NGOs share similar objectives, it is not always the case as there are as diverse objectives as there are numbers of NGOs and their reporting pattern varies in accordance with this diversity. The review makes a case for a more comprehensive definition of SR suitable for NGOs using four elements as well as providing suggestions for where research in this area might focus to enhance the overall body of knowledge. The study contributes to theory and practice by introducing new elements guiding the definition of SR in NGOs which supports accountability and proper functioning of a circular economy and promotes sustainable development.

AB  - Purpose - The objective of this paper is to investigate systematically the discipline of supply chain management (SCM) within the context of sustainability. The two concepts are increasingly aligned, and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) represents an evolving field where they explicitly interact. Given their complex and holistic nature, breaking down the literature to understand its structures, processes, connections and limitations can provide an objective view of the status of research in these highly important fields, identifying key areas for future research/theory development.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of current SCM literature is carried out, specifically in relation to the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability.
   Findings - SSCM and the integration of sustainability into supply chains is a significant but evolving field evidenced by a current bias in the literature towards theory development and highly qualitative research methods. The environmental dimension is significantly better represented in the literature through specific processes at all stages of the supply chain. The social dimension is recognised, but receives less emphasis than expected given SCM's focus on interaction, relationships and communication. These two dimensions are treated separately in the literature with limited insight on how to integrate them and current SCM and sustainability research provides limited practical outputs.
   Research limitations/implications - The review focuses on environmental and social sustainability within supply chains without explicit consideration of the economic dimension.
   Practical implications - The review highlights the key themes and issues for supply chain managers faced with implementing sustainability. It also illustrates a number of areas for future research, along with the need for researchers to develop more practical tools for implementing SSCM.
   Originality/value - Indicates the extent to which sustainability is integrated within SCM and where the research emphasis currently lies. The environmental dimension is significantly more defined and developed in the literature. SCM literature emphasises the importance of long-term supplier relationships, but this "people-focused" approach does not appear to translate into socially responsible supply chains. It suggests that the more process-driven nature of environmental sustainability makes it easier to put into supply chain practice. There is also limited research or evidence on how the two dimensions can be integrated despite recognition of their inter-relationship.

AB  - Camera trapping is an effective non-invasive method for collecting data on wildlife species to address questions of ecological and conservation interest. We reviewed 2,167 camera trap (CT) articles from 1994 to 2020. Through the lens of technological diffusion, we assessed trends in: (1) CT adoption measured by published research output, (2) topic, taxonomic, and geographic diversification and composition of CT applications, and (3) sampling effort, spatial extent, and temporal duration of CT studies. Annual publications of CT articles have grown 81-fold since 1994, increasing at a rate of 1.26 (SE = 0.068) per year since 2005, but with decelerating growth since 2017. Topic, taxonomic, and geographic richness of CT studies increased to encompass 100% of topics, 59.4% of ecoregions, and 6.4% of terrestrial vertebrates. However, declines in per article rates of accretion and plateaus in Shannon's H for topics and major taxa studied suggest upper limits to further diversification of CT research as currently practiced. Notable compositional changes of topics included a decrease in capture-recapture, recent decrease in spatial-capture-recapture, and increases in occupancy, interspecific interactions, and automated image classification. Mammals were the dominant taxon studied; within mammalian orders carnivores exhibited a unimodal peak whereas primates, rodents and lagomorphs steadily increased. Among biogeographic realms we observed decreases in Oceania and Nearctic, increases in Afrotropic and Palearctic, and unimodal peaks for Indomalayan and Neotropic. Camera days, temporal extent, and area sampled increased, with much greater rates for the 0.90 quantile of CT studies compared to the median. Next-generation CT studies are poised to expand knowledge valuable to wildlife ecology and conservation by posing previously infeasible questions at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales, on a greater array of species, and in a wider variety of environments. Converting potential into broad-based application will require transferable models of automated image classification, and data sharing among users across multiple platforms in a coordinated manner. Further taxonomic diversification likely will require technological modifications that permit more efficient sampling of smaller species and adoption of recent improvements in modeling of unmarked populations. Environmental diversification can benefit from engineering solutions that expand ease of CT sampling in traditionally challenging sites.

AB  - Tourism is one of the industries that contributes to climate change. Tourism accounts for about 10% of total global GDP, while contributing about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, far more than many industries. The study of tourism carbon emissions is indispensable for global sustainable development. However, current research summaries on the field of tourism carbon emissions rarely describe the research dilemmas and future trends that the field desperately needs to address. This has led to fewer studies on tourism carbon emissions in recent years, with researchers turning to study environmentally responsible behavior for which data are more readily available. This is dangerous for the perception of sustainable tourism development and climate change. This paper first identifies the commonly concerned research issues in the tourism carbon emissions field through keyword analysis. By analyzing the existing research contents and topics, this paper proceeds to comb the inner logic among those researches in three dimensions which are time, space and topics, thus proposing a research framework. Finally, this paper puts forward four research areas needed to be improved and four directions we can go further, namely 4I and 4P. Other current review literature in this field focuses only on analyzing authors, journals, institutions, etc. without analyzing the logical relevance of the research content. In this paper, we believe that a research review based on the content of the literature itself is what will show scholars the current state of research and research issues in the field. And the constructed research framework can further clarify the research content and topics in the field and present a clear picture of the research content for relevant scholars. Therefore this study is convinced that a clear research framework will bring a powerful direction for the tourism carbon emissions research field. The research results will certainly make some contribution to the tourism carbon emissions field, by providing new viewpoints and research trends on tourism carbon emissions.

AB  - Background: The application of regorafenib has changed the landscape of subsequent-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as two of the most common inflammatory factors, are suggested to be potential prognostic factors for mCRC patients treated with regorafenib, but the results are conflicting. In this study, we conducted a meta analysis to evaluate the prognostic role of NLR and CRP in mCRC patients treated with regorafenib.Methods: We searched online databases such as Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane library up to April 2022, without language limitation, to identify clinical studies evaluating the prognostic role of NLR or CRP in regorafenib treated mCRC patients. The main endpoints were hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The associations between NLR, CRP, and the above endpoints were extracted. Review Manager 5.4 was used to conduct the combined analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied for assessing the quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was detected by chi-square based Q test and I2 statistic, and publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's test. Results: Eight studies involving 1,287 cases were included, with 5 reporting survival outcomes based on NLR level and 4 reporting survival according to CRP level. The results of meta-analysis showed that the calculated HR of OS for subsequent-line regorafenib in mCRC patients with high versus low NLR was 2.52 [I2=52%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.75-3.64; P < 0.00001]. The combined HR of PFS with high versus low baseline NLR was 2.11 (I2=12%, 95% CI: 1.80-2.48; P < 0.00001). For patients with a high level of CRP, the OS was significantly shorter when compared with patients with a low level of CRP (I2=0%, HR =1.88; 95% CI: 1.55-2.29; P < 0.00001). Conclusions: High level of NLR could be associated with OS in mCRC patients treated with regorafenib. It is suggested that the impact of regorafenib on OS may vary according to the baseline NLR.

AB  - Introduction. The regulation of economic and environmental impacts of the entire military-industrial complex is a cross-sectoral and international problem. At the same time, research in this area is rather fragmented, which reduces the effectiveness of systematic reviews of the security and defence sector in the context of the green economy. The relevance of the issue of greening the defence industry is significantly enhanced by the need to regulate and operate domestic defence industries in the context of the country's military operations.
   Aim and tasks. The aim of the study is to substantiate the economic mechanism for regulating the greening of enterprises of the defence industry of Ukraine.
   Results. The economic and environmental security requirements for defence industry enterprises are studied, as the activity of polluting sources of enterprises, including defence enterprises in Ukraine, has generally decreased, in 2021, emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources decreased by 9.0% compared to 2020, to almost 2.2 million tonnes, ammunition was disposed of (235.29 thousand tonnes of ammunition were disposed of from 2014 to 2020) and liquid rocket fuel (16.7 thousand tonnes of melange). In 2021, enterprises, organisations and institutions spent UAH 41.3 billion on environmental protection, compared to UAH 43.7 billion in 2020. Of the total environmental costs in 2021, 68% were current expenses and 32% were capital investments. The strategic directions of greening the defence industry enterprises have been identified, including the introduction of resource-saving technologies, environmental monitoring of environmental impact and reduction of the negative impact of the defence industry units.
   Conclusion. The realisation of the greening potential will help protect the country's natural resource potential under the influence of the defence industry. A system of measures should be developed to ensure the protection and restoration of natural systems at a certain cost. Given the importance of the defence industry for the country in the context of current external threats and armed conflicts in certain parts of the territory, it is necessary to develop a strategic vision of environmental security with the involvement of all relevant organisations and taking into account the degree of responsibility and motivation for eco-oriented management.

AB  - Purpose of Review Ground-based mechanized forest operations can cause severe soil disturbances that are often long lasting and detrimental to the health of forested ecosystems. To reduce these soil disturbances, focus is being increasingly directed at identifying and using appropriate mitigation techniques. This systematic review considered 104 scientific articles and reported the main findings according to four core themes: terrain-related factors, operational planning, machine modifications, and types of amendments used to mitigate machine-induced soil impacts. Recent Findings For terrain-related factors, most severe disturbances occur on machine operating trails exceeding 20% slope and that soil bulk density and rut depth show greater increases in fine-textured soils. When considering operational planning, trafficability maps proved to be helpful in reducing the frequency and magnitude of soil damages as well as the length of trails needed within harvest sites, especially if they are regularly updated with weather information. Machine modifications, through high flotation tires, use of extra bogie axle, lower inflation pressure, and use of steel flexibles tracks, are highly researched topics because of the considerable upside in terms of machine ground pressure distribution and increased traction. Two main types of amendments emerged to mitigate soil disturbances: brush mats and mulch cover. Brush mats created from harvesting debris can spread the load of a machine to a greater area thereby lowering peak loads transferred to the soil. Brush mats of 15-20 kg m(-2) are being recommended for adequate soil protection from harvesting operations. To conclude, we outline recommendations and strategies on the use of soil mitigation techniques within cut-to-length forest operations. New research opportunities are also identified and discussed. Considering single factors causing machine-induced soil disturbances remains important but there is a pressing need for having a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle the complex problems associated with machine/soil/plant interactions.

AB  - Shipping emission reduction is one of the most critical issues in the transportation industry and world emission reduction research. Ports, as important hubs and sources of emissions have also received much attention. This paper investigated the development process of port emission reduction from earlier 'environmental factors and energy scheduling' to 'low-carbon and green ports' by conducting a systematic review and Citespace visual analysis. It can be also concluded that the policy has a great impact on the development of this research field. Meanwhile, this review found that among the emission reduction measures for ships in port, the average percentage of the energy measures potential is 25%-70%. The range of optimization operation measures is 30%- 50%. There is a gap between the two measures. According to the diverse emission sources in the port, there is no significant difference (20%-60%) for the potential of measures application in land area. Therefore, before setting the reduction targets, ports need to know their emission level and establish emission inventories, as well as consider external factors (policy, economy, technology, etc.). Overall, port energy measures are the key points to achieving low and zero carbon targets. In the future, by addressing technical bottlenecks in energy use (such as hydrogen storage and maintenance), ports and ships will be able to further reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and increase their potential to reduce emissions. This paper aims to systematically review and explore the effects (experiences) and problems (challenges) of the abatement measures taken by different ports, to help lowabatement capacity ports to learn and find the measures that suit the emission reduction development most. For the choice of future energy, the port needs to analyze the corresponding policy factors and improve the abatement capacity through the integration of multiple measures, to understand the 'zero carbon goal' as soon as possible and make contributions to the environmental protection and ecological development of the region and world.

AB  - Restoring degraded landscapes is critical for achieving global environmental and development goals, and agroforestry is increasingly promoted as a nature-based solution to land degradation. Farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR) is an agroforestry-based approach for restoring degraded agricultural land and it has been widely implemented in African drylands. However, a recent systematic review found significant gaps in the evidence base for FMNR, including that its upscaling has been based on inadequate understandings of local contexts. Furthermore, studies reporting on farmer adoption of FMNR have mainly relied on quantitative data from household surveys, resulting in limited understandings of what motivates farmers who practice FMNR. This paper draws on the results of a qualitative study in northeastern Ghana to address two questions: 1) How and why do farmers practice FMNR? And 2) How does context influence farmers' rationales for practicing FMNR? We found that farmers grounded their perspectives on the utility of FMNR in nuanced understandings of the local farming and land and tree tenure systems. The results of our study also demonstrate how farmers' decision-making was situated within socially and agroecologically differentiated contexts, which were conditioned by long-term, multifaceted change in the region. We conclude that in spite of the rush to scale up FMNR, more attention should be directed to assessing where, when, and for whom FMNR might be appropriate. Such assessments should be grounded in resource managers' preferences, local agricultural and land and tree tenure systems, and the requisite biophysical conditions for FMNR. To support these efforts, we propose an FMNR suitability assessment framework, based on our findings and those from related studies. As landscape restoration is scaled up globally, initiatives should be informed by evidence demonstrating how and why resource managers might practice a restoration activity as well as how context influences their choices.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The application of the principles of green chemistry to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNP) is a new emerging issue concerning sustainability. Together with the green nanotechnology, this is an evolving approach with innovative, reliable and sustainable solutions for applications in all fields of life. Those principles may be used on greener bio-inspired materials applied for the synthesis of MNP as well as for their immobilization on solid supports. This review is carried out for its relevance, covering the available literature on the green fabrication of MNP from different bio-resources, ranging from micro- to macromolecular levels (bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and plants) acting as reducing and capping agents and enabling the immobilization of biogenic MNP on sustainable materials to improve their performance when applied to wastewater treatment. Materials derived from renewable and earth-abundant sources (clays, natural zeolites, sediments, sands, rocks and volcanic glasses) or residues from food, industry and agro-forestry activity, activated carbon and biochar were found as sustainable supports with diverse applications such as disinfection of water or removal/degradation of various pollutants of wastewater. For the first time, a thorough review of the literature available on this topic has been carried out and the synthesis and immobilization of biogenic MNP on sustainable materials are reported, through two main routes: (i) bio-inspired fabrication of MNP, with the consideration of the adverse effects of their suspension status and (ii) supported MNP obtained with sustainable supports, with focus on natural or on waste materials, activated carbon and biochar, as well as on the obtained modified sustainable materials. Finally, an economic and environmental perspective as well as the challenges on the use of supported MNP will be presented.
   The simultaneous use of bio-resources and sustainable materials as reducing/capping agents and supporting materials to obtain supported metal nanoparticles is a significant green approach applied to wastewater treatment.

AB  - Farmers' perception of climate change is crucial in adaptation intention and process. However, farmers' perceptions may not be timely, accurate and systematically consistent with the direction and significance of observational records. Although some research compared farmers' perceptions and climate data, little attention has been paid to comprehensibly analyse both data sources discrepancies based on empirical studies results. By combining bibliometrics and a systematic review approach, we identify which approaches are used to compare perceived and observed data, how both patterns have been mutually evolved, which factors determine their (in)consistency, and if their accordance and robustness affect farmers' adaptive capacity. We analyse a portfolio of 147 papers collected from the Scopus library catalogue since 2000. The bibliometric analysis was coupled with an exploratory analysis of 98 papers selected from the original portfolio. The literature is extensive, fast-growing, and spans several disciplines. We identify four consolidated research lines: (a) perceived risk and farmers' adaptive capacity nexus, (b) crop vulnerability due to temperature increase and erratic rainfall patterns, (c) forecasting use and influence in farmers' decisions, and (d) climate change awareness conditioning farmers' profiles. Nonetheless, we observe some research gaps: (a) a conceptual mismatch in 'normal pattern' or 'drought' meaning, (b) poor or limited data from meteorological stations, (c) overlook or oversimplification of local knowledge in describing perception, (d) farmers' memory weaknesses to keep track of climate alterations, and (e) a geographical dissonance in favour of Global South regions. Our science-metric study also reveals some research questions to be consolidated: Can the perception of extreme events increase climate change awareness? Can greater awareness reduce discrepancy with observed data? How do heuristics and socio-psychological filters influence farmers' awareness and interpretation of climate data? We suggest putting major efforts into reinforcing these research lines as part of a novel domain-dependent trend to reduce the discrepancy.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has grown rapidly and is now well established within the electronics industry. The growing number of journal publications, conferences, and special issues is a proof for the same. A number of literature reviews have been published till now in this area focusing on different aspects. This study has identified 134 significant journal articles to conduct a systematic and narrative literature review. This review covers a wide range of product categories and analyzes the usefulness of LCA as a decision-making tool within the electronics industry which has not been explored fully in previous reviews conducted in this area of research. For this purpose, we organized LCA studies into 10 main product categories. A narrative review was employed to summarize the significant findings from the LCA studies. Although the central objective of all the studies was to evaluate the environmental impact created by the product, the focus and methods employed differed. A systematic review was used to categorize the overall frameworks used in the studies. The studies were classified based on their research purpose, types of approach, LCIA methods used, system boundaries involved, data collection methods, and data analysis levels. Within the subcategory of research purpose, three research domains were identified and the studies were classified accordingly. Generally it has been revealed that use phase, end of life, and production phase are the dominant phases in that order. However discrepancies occur owing to functional units, data usage, and assumptions made. All these and more make benchmarking difficult. Finally we identified gaps that merit attention in future research. It is also hoped that this review is a good resource for anyone interested in doing research on LCA of electronic products, helping them identify current research trends, provide suggestions for future research, and stimulate interest in creating new research directions.

AB  - Purpose- This study aims to give a glimpse of the existing blockchain applications across industries and add to a complete knowledge of the blockchain's properties.Design/methodology/approach- Systematic literature review is used as the research strategy for this investigation and other aspects of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses framework have been incorporated to create a scholarly publications evaluation of the blockchain-based application in the financial arena and its future. The research looks at 86 studies published between 2018 and 2022.Findings- There has been a steady but noticeable increase in the study of blockchain's potential in many application domains over the past few of years. This rising tendency illustrates the newness and potential of blockchain technology, as well as the increasing attention from academics. According to the findings, blockchain is an appropriate solution for processing transactions using cryptocurrencies; nevertheless, it still has significant technical issues and limits that require to be exploring and solving before it can be considered a viable option. It is therefore, necessary to have a high level of reliability for payments and confidentiality, in addition to maintaining the anonymity of nodes, to stop assaults and efforts to disrupt transactions in the blockchain.Practical implications- This study has several important theoretical and practical implications. First, it adds to the body of knowledge on blockchain and Fintech, focusing on the transaction side. While much blockchain research has focused on how the technology may affect strategic choices, this study has shed light on its potential from the perspective of financial reporting. Second, by highlighting the importance of the demand for the prompt identification of losses, this work adds to the body of knowledge on the factors that influence transaction frauds involving paper money. Additionally, by establishing the link between transparency and virtual transactions, the author backs up the asymmetric responses of investors to different investment possibilities. It looks at the evolution of financial technology (Fintech) and shows how it can be used to take the advantage of unique opportunities.Originality/value -The study is different and novel from the previously published literature on this topic mainly because of its comprehensiveness, as it revolves around all industrial and commercial areas. The three main lines of research have been outlined, namely, classifying the many blockchain-based innovations that will alter the financial landscape in many industries; identifying whether these industries are a good fit for blockchain's wealth creation potential; and directing researchers by outlining prospective study pathways.

AB  - IntroductionCOVID-19 has challenged global health care systems and resulted in prehospital delays for time-sensitive emergencies, like stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA). However, there are conflicting international reports on the level of effect of the pandemic on ambulance response intervals and emergency call volumes for these conditions.ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to synthesize the international evidence on the effect of COVID-19 on ambulance response intervals and emergency call volume for suspected stroke and TIA.MethodsFollowing a published protocol, we conducted a systematic search of six databases through May 31, 2022. We re-ran this search on April 14, 2023, to check for any new papers. We considered for inclusion peer-reviewed quantitative studies comparing prehospital emergency care for adults with suspected stroke/TIA before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two authors screened title/abstract and full text articles. One author carried out data extraction, with a random selection of articles being checked by another author. We calculated overall pooled estimates of ambulance intervals (activation, response, patient care, and total prehospital intervals) and stroke/TIA emergency call volume. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses included location and stroke/TIA diagnosis. Two authors assessed study quality using the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute tool. We worked with patient and public involvement contributors and clinical and policy stakeholders throughout the review.ResultsOf 4,083 studies identified, 52 unique articles met the inclusion criteria. Mean response interval (-1.29 min [-2.19 to -0.38]) and mean total prehospital interval (-6.42 min [-10.60 to -2.25]) were shorter in the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, there was a higher incidence rate of emergency call volume for suspected stroke/TIA per day pre-COVID-19 compared with the COVID-19 period (log IRR = 0.17 [0.02 to 0.33]). Ambulance response interval definitions and terminology varied between regions and countries.ConclusionsOur review indicates that prehospital delays for suspected stroke/TIA increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, emergency call volume for suspected stroke/TIA decreased during this period. In order to minimize delays in future pandemics or other health care emergencies future research may involve understanding the potential reasons for these delays.
