AB  - This article examines whether democratic deliberation can enhance participants' capacity to consider future generations' perspectives and willingness to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. In addition to normal deliberation, we are interested in the effects of a mental time travel exercise where deliberators imagine themselves in the future (without ageing). The study is based on an experiment conducted as a part of Citizens' Assembly that contributed to the long-term planning of the Satakunta region in Finland. Our findings suggest that deliberation as such increases participants' willingness to consider future generations' perspectives in long-term planning; yet the mental time travel exercise had only a modest impact on perspective-taking. The results also show some support for the assumption that deliberation can enhance willingness to make sacrifices for future generations, although we do not see such an impact in case of an intergenerational conflict in flood protection.

AB  - Polar bears have experienced a rapid loss of sea-ice habitat in the Barents Sea. Monitoring this subpopulation focuses on the effects on polar bear demography. In August 2015, we conducted a survey in the Norwegian Arctic to estimate polar bear numbers and reveal population substructure. DNA profiles from biopsy samples and ear tags identified on photographs revealed that about half of the bears in Svalbard, compared to only 4.5% in the pack ice north of the archipelago, were recognized recaptures. The recaptured bears had originally been marked in Svalbard, mostly in spring. The existence of a local Svalbard stock, and another ecotype of bears using the pack ice in autumn with low likelihood of visiting Svalbard, support separate population size estimation for the two areas. Mainly by aerial survey line transect distance sampling methods, we estimated that 264 (95% CI = 199 - 363) bears were in Svalbard, close to 241 bears estimated for August 2004. The pack ice area had an estimated 709 bears (95% CI = 334 - 1026). The pack ice and the total (Svalbard + pack ice, 973 bears, 95% CI = 334 - 1026) both had higher estimates compared to August 2004 (444 and 685 bears, respectively), but the increase was not significant. There is no evidence that the fast reduction of sea-ice habitat in the area has yet led to a reduction in population size. The carrying capacity is likely reduced significantly, but recovery from earlier depletion up to 1973 may still be ongoing.

AB  - Wolverine (Gulo gulo) predation on sheep (Ovis aces) on summer range in mountain areas has been documented in Norway during the last 15 years. Norweigan government policy is to sustain viable wolverine populations. However, the conflict created by wolverine predation on sheep and domestic reindeer results in strong local pressure for licenses to kill wolverines, and results as well in illegal killing. Illegal killing poses a threat to sustainable management of this protected species. Because sheep are present only in the alpine ecosystem during the short summer period, wolverine populations probably are not dependent on sheep predation. The aim of our study was to find nonlethal taste and olfactory agents that have an aversive effect on wolverines. We showed that certain chemicals and oils are potential aversive agents for captive wolverines by adding small amounts of chemicals to die normal diet, and by observing their reaction both directly and through video analysis. Five oils and 3 chemicals in combination Sate distinctive aversive reactions and were considered a good choice for tests in the field with wild wolverines. Development of dispensers is necessary for using the chemicals as long-lasting repellents on sheep. Volatile repellents attached to lambs are a potential method for decreasing wolverine predation on sheep.

AB  - Mobility services and accessibility services could contribute to reduced car-dependency and a more sustainable transport system. However, uncertainty remains regarding what the effects will be and further research is needed. In this paper we examine potential effects on passenger car-travel in an urban context. To do so, we actuate the Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) framework using a System Dynamics approach and develop thematic Causal Loop Diagrams. We draw on the findings from a literature study and workshops engaging actors involved in creating visions and planning for the future of mobility and accessibility services in Stockholm, Sweden. The effects discovered are categorized as direct, enabling and structural/systemic, using a retrofitted version of the ThreeLevels Model. Contributions include the mapping of mechanisms through which the services can have positive and negative effects in relation to ASI, demonstrating a high degree of interconnectedness. This includes potential synergetic and competitive relations between the services. In addition, the approach gives insight to potential cumulative impact of the services, relatable to Mobility as a Service, including 'user near' effects regarding, e.g., commuting and leisure travel, as well as systemic and structural level effects. A discussion is conducted on the implications for actors and policy-makers.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to illustrate the global risks facing an award-winning company known for best practices in sustainability and HRM that, nevertheless, is challenged by a contentious land dispute with indigenous communities and numerous stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study based primarily on secondary sources, such as reports and web sites of the company and its stakeholders. Findings - Aracruz Celulose SA, a Brazilian pulp company founded by a Norwegian, owns legal title to land claimed by indigenous communities. As a result, they face a complex array of additional stakeholders with contradictory perspectives: local and international non-governmental organizations, various Brazilian and Norwegian Government entities, the World Bank, and investors. The company runs the risk of losing land and assets, reputation, and investors. There are few simple solutions to the dilemma of unresolved property rights and agrarian reform problematic in much of Latin America. Even Aracruz's hoped - for court ruling may not guarantee an end to conflict without a creative solution. Research limitations/implications - The controversy is ongoing and the outcomes are not yet determined. Based on one case, limited generalizations can be made. Originality/value - Numerous best practices in the operational areas under a company's control cannot completely protect firms from risks related to larger societal dilemmas and the need to negotiate win-win solutions with stakeholders.

AB  - The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM Convention) aims to mitigate the introduction risk of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens (HAOP) via ships' ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention has set regulations for ships to utilise exceptions and exemptions from ballast water management under specific circumstances. This study evaluated local and regional case studies to provide clarity for situations, where ships could be excepted or exempted from ballast water management without risking recipient locations to new introductions of HAOP. Ships may be excepted from ballast water management if all ballasting operations are conducted in the same location (Regulation A-3.5 of the BWM Convention). The same location case study determined whether the entire Vuosaari harbour (Helsinki, Finland) should be considered as the same location based on salinity and composition of HAOP between the two harbour terminals. The Vuosaari harbour case study revealed mismatching occurrences of HAOP between the harbour terminals, supporting the recommendation that exceptions based on the same location concept should be limited to the smallest feasible areas within a harbour. The other case studies evaluated whether ballast water exemptions could be granted for ships using two existing risk assessment (RA) methods (Joint Harmonised Procedure [JHP] and Same Risk Area [SRA]), consistent with Regulation A-4 of the BWM Convention. The JHP method compares salinity and presence of target species (TS) between donor and recipient ports to indicate the introduction risk (high or low) attributed to transferring unmanaged ballast water. The SRA method uses a biophysical model to determine whether HAOP could naturally disperse between ports, regardless of their transportation in ballast water. The results of the JHP case study for the Baltic Sea and North-East Atlantic Ocean determined that over 97% of shipping routes within these regions resulted in a high-risk indication. The one route assessed in the Gulf of Maine, North America also resulted in a high-risk outcome. The SRA assessment resulted in an overall weak connectivity between all ports assessed within the Gulf of the St. Lawrence, indicating that a SRA-based exemption would not be appropriate for the entire study area. In summary, exceptions and exemptions should not be considered as common alternatives for ballast water management. The availability of recent and detailed species occurrence data was considered the most important factor to conduct a successful and reliable RA. SRA models should include biological factors that influence larval dispersal and recruitment potential (e.g., pelagic larval duration, settlement period) to provide a more realistic estimation of natural dispersal.

AB  - Driven by considerations of sustainability, it has become increasingly difficult over the past 15-20 years - at least intellectually - to separate out the water infrastructure and water metabolism of cities from their intimately inter-related nutrient and energy metabolisms. Much of the focus of this difficulty settles on the wastewater component of the city's water infrastructure and its associated fluxes of nutrients (N, P, C, and so on). Indeed, notwithstanding the massive volumes of these materials flowing into and out of the city, the notion of an urban nutrient infrastructure is conspicuous by its absence. Likewise, we do not tend to discuss, or conduct research into, "soilshed" agencies, or soilshed management, or Integrated Nutrient Resources Management (as opposed to its most familiar companion, Integrated Water Resources Management, or IWRM). The paper summarizes some of the benefits (and challenges) deriving from adopting this broader, multi-sectoral "systems" perspective on addressing water-nutrient-energy systems in city-watershed settings. Such a perspective resonates with the growing interest in broader policy circles in what is called the "water-food-energy security nexus". The benefits and challenges of our Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA) are illustrated through computational results from two primary case studies: Atlanta, Georgia, USA; and London, UK. Since our work is part of the International Network on Cities as Forces for Good in the Environment (CFG; see http://www.cfgnet.org), in which other case studies are currently being initiated - for example, on Kathmandu, Nepal - we close by reflecting upon these issues of water-nutrient-energy systems in three urban settings with quite different styles and speeds of development.

AB  - Cryptic species are rarer than their combined, morphologically recognisable species. Each cryptic species may have its own habitat requirements and distribution, and each should be considered separately in biodiversity conservation. This investigation explores how well the two cryptic species of the wetland moss Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedenas s.I., included in Annex II of the EU Habitat Directive, are safeguarded in existing protected sites in Sweden. Further, the northern distribution limit of the southern of the two cryptic species is explored. The distributions of the two cryptic species and their intraspecific variation are judged by the nuclear ITS1 + 2 and the two chloroplast markers rp/16 and trnL-trnF for a set of 89 specimens. The genetic differences between the two cryptic species are significant, but there are no differences between the protected and non-protected subsets within the respective species. The protected areas therefore represent these two species' genetic variation well. The populations of both cryptic species appear stable, according to their genetic signals. One of the two cryptic species occurs almost throughout Sweden, whereas the other occurs only to the south of the southern limit of the southern boreal zone, except for two finds slightly further north in climatically mild areas.

AB  - The present paper concentrates on the use of remote sensing by satellite imagery for detecting ancient tracks and roads in the area between Palmyra and the Euphrates in Syria. The Syrian desert was traversed by caravans already in the Bronze Age, and during the Greco-Roman period the traffic increased with the Silk Road and trade as well as with military missions annexing the areas into empires. SYGIS-the Finnish archaeological survey and mapping project traced, recorded and documented ancient sites and roads in the region of Jebel Bishri in Central Syria in 2000-2010 before the outbreak of the civil war in Syria. Captured data of ancient roads and bridge points bring new light to the study of ancient communication framework in the area. Archaeological research carried out by the project on the ground confirmed the authenticity of many road alignments, new military and water harvesting sites as well as civilian settlements, showing that the desert-steppe area was actively used and developed probably from the second century AD. The studies further demonstrated that the area between Palmyra and the Euphrates was militarily more organised already in the second and third centuries AD than earlier believed. Chronologically, the start of this coincided with the "goldenage" of the Palmyrene caravans in the second century AD. Topography and landscape were integral parts of the construction of graves/tumuli as sign-posts guiding in the desert, as well as roads and all kinds of settlements whether military or civilian.

AB  - This research addresses the question of how to better disseminate the concept of sustainable fishery along the Arctic shipping route. The fishery trade network of Arctic is constructed and the complex network theory is applied to conduct the analysis. We further simulate the network by introducing three factors, namely, national will, knowledge absorption capacity and initial propagation node and applying the SIR (susceptible-infectiveremoved) model. It is found that, in order to disseminate the sustainable fishery concept in the Arctic shipping route, there is a need for countries to increase their national will, increase their capacity to absorb knowledge, and give full play to the role of high-node countries. This paper theoretically suggests three countries of Norway, Denmark, and China to act as initiators of the network and proposes possible measures that countries can take to cooperate on sustainable fisheries development. Our findings offer a useful reference on international arctic fishery cooperation.

AB  - The oil and gas industry plays a vital role in meeting the ever-growing energy demand of the human race needed for its sustainable existence. Newer unconventional wells are drilled for the extraction of hydrocarbons that requires advanced innovations to encounter the challenges associated with the drilling operations. The type of drill bits utilized in any drilling operation has an economical influence on the overall drilling operation. The selection of suitable drill bits is a challenging task for driller while planning for new wells. Usually, when it comes to deciding the drill bit type, generally, the data of previously drilled wells present in similar geological formation are analyzed manually, making it subjective, erroneous, and time consuming. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to propose an automatic data-driven bit type selection method for drilling the target formation based on the Optimum Penetration Rate (ROP). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) have been utilized to develop a new data-driven modeling approach for the selection of optimum bit type. Data from three nearby Norwegian wells have been utilized for the testing of the proposed approach. RSM has been implemented to generate the objective function for ROP due to its strong data-fitting characteristic, while ABC has been utilized to locate the global optimal value of ROP. The proposed model has been generated with a 95% confidence level and compared with the existing model of Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm. The proposed approach can also be applied over any other geological field to automate the drill bit selection, which can minimize human error and drilling cost. The United Nations Development Programme also promotes innovations that are economical for industrial sectors and human sustainability.

AB  - Stigma and social exclusion related to mental health are of substantial public health importance for Europe. As part of ROAMER (ROAdmap for MEntal health Research in Europe), we used systematic mapping techniques to describe the current state of research on stigma and social exclusion across Europe. Findings demonstrate growing interest in this field between 2007 and 2012. Most studies were descriptive (60%), focused on adults of working age (60%) and were performed in Northwest Europe-primarily in the UK (32%), Finland (8%), Sweden (8%) and Germany (7%). In terms of mental health characteristics, the largest proportion of studies investigated general mental health (20%), common mental disorders (16%), schizophrenia (16%) or depression (14%). There is a paucity of research looking at mechanisms to reduce stigma and promote social inclusion, or at factors that might promote resilience or protect against stigma/social exclusion across the life course. Evidence is also limited in relation to evaluations of interventions. Increasing incentives for cross-country research collaborations, especially with new EU Member States and collaboration across European professional organizations and disciplines, could improve understanding of the range of underpinning social and cultural factors which promote inclusion or contribute toward lower levels of stigma, especially during times of hardship.

AB  - This paper is concerned with question of how to assess results of networking which is an important element in movement towards sustainable development. Although based upon a large body of research, including empirical studies, the question of assessment of the networking results remains un-addressed, to a large extent. Based on an in-depth analysis of two Swedish tourism networks for sustainability and a detailed literature review, this paper identifies appropriate categories for assessment of results of the functioning of networks for sustainable development. The contribution of this study is the development of a generic framework to guide the assessment of results for sustainability networking. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to increase understanding of the domains of life that are important to Swedish women with chronic rheumatic disease and to describe their dissatisfaction with these domains. Fifty women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and 50 with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) were interviewed by telephone regarding their quality of life using five open-ended questions. Content analysis of their responses revealed nine categories: Health/wellness, Family/friends, Work, House/home/living environment, Social support/functional services, Hobbies/cultural activities, Sufficient income, Independence, Integrity/identity. Areas of importance correspond closely to those areas with which they were most dissatisfied. Although the domains identified in both groups were the same, SLE patients expressed more dissatisfaction with their perceived control over their bodies and understanding about their condition on the part of physicians and people in general. RA patients were more dissatisfied with areas of their lives that threatened their independence. Health care providers should be aware of these areas of dissatisfaction so that they can plan strategies to maximize patient quality of life.

AB  - Improving feed efficiency in dairy cattle could result in more profitable and environmentally sustainable dairy production through lowering feed costs and emissions from dairy farming. In addition, beef production based on dairy herds generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions per unit of meat output than beef production from suckler cow systems. Different scenarios were used to assess the profitability of adding traits, excluded from the current selection index for Finnish Ayrshire, to the breeding goal for combined dairy and beef production systems. The additional breeding goal traits were growth traits (average daily gain of animals in the fattening and rearing periods), carcass traits (fat covering, fleshiness and dressing percentage), mature live weight (LW) of cows and residual feed intake (RFI) traits. A breeding scheme was modeled for Finnish Ayrshire under the current market situation in Finland using the deterministic simulation software ZPLAN+. With the economic values derived for the current production system, the inclusion of growth and carcass traits, while preventing LW increase generated the highest improvement in the discounted profit of the breeding program (3.7%), followed by the scenario where all additional traits were included simultaneously (5.1%). The use of a selection index that included growth and carcass traits excluding LW, increased the profit (0.8%), but reduced the benefits resulted from breeding for beef traits together with LW. A moderate decrease in the profit of the breeding program was obtained when adding only LW to the breeding goal (-3.1%), whereas, adding only RFI traits to the breeding goal resulted in a minor increase in the profit (1.4%). Including beef traits with LW in the breeding goal showed to be the most potential option to improve the profitability of the combined dairy and beef production systems and would also enable a higher rate of self-sufficiency in beef. When considering feed efficiency related traits, the inclusion of LW traits in the breeding goal that includes growth and carcass traits could be more profitable than the inclusion of RFI, because the marginal costs of measuring LW can be expected to be lower than for RFI and it is readily available for selection. In addition, before RFI can be implemented as a breeding objective, the genetic correlations between RFI and other breeding goal traits estimated for the studied population as well as information on the most suitable indicator traits for RFI are needed to assess more carefully the consequences of selecting for RFI.

AB  - Purpose Addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities is an essential part of a recovery programme that has distinct links to livelihoods, health, education, security and social and family stability. The housing factor acts as a social centre for family and friends, a source of pride and cultural identity and a resource that commands both political and economic importance. Therefore, addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities should be seen as a mode to promote resilience and sustainable communities. Instead, the consideration of housing needs merely as a physical need results in many issues to the communities, including no access to livelihood, poor living condition, health problems, lack of financial independence, lack of social satisfaction and social cohesion, and sometimes even recreates and worsens the existing vulnerabilities of displaced communities. Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors to consider when addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities, promoting resilience and sustainable communities. Design/methodology/approach The research team of the project titled REbuildinG AfteR Displacement (REGARD) conducted 47 in-depth interviews in four partner countries (the UK, Sweden, Estonia and Sri Lanka) with officials, community representatives, social support networks, agency networks, etc. Apart from that, focus group discussions were conducted with the community members in Sri Lanka covering both conflict-induced and disaster-induced displacement. Findings The findings of this paper revealed that the housing factor has a significant role in rebuilding communities and determining the long-term satisfaction of displaced communities. Further, the results present eight essential factors to consider when addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities, promoting resilient and sustainable communities. Practical implications The findings are helpful for future planners, urban designers, architects and policymakers who work in the resettlement field. Planners, urban designers and architects can use these identified factors to cross-check their resettlement planning and designing strategies in addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities. Further, policymakers can mainstream these identified factors into the resettlement housing-related policies and regulations. Originality/value Addressing the housing needs of the displaced communities is an essential part of a recovery programme that has distinct links to livelihoods, health, education, security and social and family stability. The housing factor acts as a social centre for family and friends, a source of pride and cultural identity and a resource that commands both political and economic importance.

AB  - The success of an impact assessment (IA) can mean both instrumental success of applying IA results directly in decision-making, and conceptual success linked to learning about policy problems more generally. Both instrumental and conceptual success can be claimed to be reliant on the knowledge exchange context of the IA, shaped by factors such as the complexity of the policy problem, type of policy area, organisational norms, actor constellations and continuance and openness of information sharing. Even though such context factors may be pre-set, they are nevertheless contested and reformulated during each IA process. This paper ties together lessons from six different IA processes that were performed between 2011 and 2013. The cases include agricultural policy at the EU and regional level in Greece, national-level climate change and energy policy in Finland and Estonia, resource efficiency policy at the German national level, and sustainable land use policy in Inner Mongolia, China. The paper introduces and applies a typology of knowledge brokerage context factors. The paper asks how knowledge brokerage is shaped by different contexts and what determines the consequent application (or non-application) of IA tools and the use of IA results. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of identification and acknowledgement of different knowledge exchange contexts in IA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The process of protection (e.g. reserves, agreements) on the lands of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners sometimes leads to conflicts (conflict: a perceived threat to needs, interests or concerns; in this study, othreato was important). To investigate predictive factors for such conflicts in southern Sweden, a questionnaire was sent to 132 NIPF owners with woodland key habitat (WKH; identified biodiversity values). The response rate was 77% and conflict was reported by 22.5% of respondents, while 14% reported good relations with authorities. The respondents reported conflict due to rules for cutting, protection and compensation. Compared with other owners, those reporting conflict were younger (mean 54 versus 62 years old), had more negative opinion about the personal contact with the authority, had twice as large an area of WKH and had more negative opinion about the WKH. Logistic regression revealed four variables that predicted conflict: area of WKH on property, opinion about WKH, opinion about personal contact and, especially, age of respondent. Younger forest owners may be more dependent upon income from harvesting than older owners. Conflicts were frequent and the factors identified here should be taken into account in forest conservation work.

AB  - Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are an effective tool for limiting livestock depredation by wild and feral predators. Unfortunately, LGDs have bitten hikers, joggers, and mountain bikers. Strategies are needed to mitigate LGD-human conflicts, especially in landscapes inhabited by large, aggressive predators where the threat of livestock depredation is greatest. One recommendation is to keep groups of sheep protected by LGDs at least 400 m from high-use recreational sites, but few data exist to support or refute this strategy. We monitored sheep and LGDs with Global Positioning System collars at seven ranches during a 3-yr period to evaluate how far, and under what circumstances, LGDs roamed from their sheep. One band of sheep (i.e., flock) was studied per ranch, with a typical band composed of 600-800 mature ewes with 900-1200 lambs. Sheep were herded in extensive grazing systems within their traditional summer or fall grazing areas in foothill and mountain landscapes of southwestern and west-central Montana. Three bands of sheep inhabited landscapes with a greater threat of depredation by gray wolves and grizzly bears, and 4 bands of sheep inhabited landscapes where the threat of depredation was mostly from coyotes. The mean and median LGD-sheep distance across all LGDs and time periods was 164 m and 86 m, respectively. LGDs roamed farther from their sheep during nighttime and crepuscular periods than during daytime; farther when the moon was more fully illuminated; farther during fall than summer; and farther in landscapes without gray wolves and grizzly bears. Female LGDs roamed farther than males. Juvenile LGDs did not roam farther than adult LGDs. Overall, our results from extensive domestic sheep grazing systems suggest that keeping range sheep 400 m away from recreation sites and rural residences will likely prevent > 90% of agonistic LGD encounters with humans.

AB  - Agri-environmental investment support that compensates landowners for the costs of wetland creation and restoration is considered an effective policy for increasing biodiversity and reducing nonpoint emissions in agricultural landscapes. This study assesses the extent to which such an agrienvironmental scheme is propagated across landowners and examines determinants of the adoption of the policy in Sweden. Using spatiotemporal variations in the implementation of the scheme, we show that endogenous spatial interaction across landowners helps propagate the adoption of the scheme. We did not find spatial interactions to play a role in the disadoption of the scheme.

AB  - At high latitudes of Europe climate change is projected to alter the risk of flooding and drought depending on the season. Farmers are the ones who decide how and when to adapt to excess, scarcity, and even to extreme precipitation events in agriculture. To understand farmer's views on the needs and means to manage future changes in precipitation, a farmer survey was organized in 2018 with 4401 respondents and a follow-up survey in 2020 with 2000 respondents. The aims were: (1) to understand farmers' views on future changes in precipitation patterns, (2) to gain an insight into farmer views on prioritization of the potential key adaptation measures (irrigation, drainage and maintenance of soil conditions) to future floods and drought episodes and thereby, (3) to be better able to support farmers in their primary task of food production in a sustainable manner in a changing climate. This study highlighted that farmers need financial support, but also more information about the costs and benefits of the measures to cope with changing precipitation patterns-not least due to the many uncertainties in projecting future precipitation patterns. As fluctuating precipitation have many environmental impacts in addition to those on production per se, costs and investments of adaptation to climatic constraints should not be payable only by the farmers. Farmers prioritized the soil organic content (SOC) and wellfunctioning subsurface drainage as the main objects of their attention, and these were clearly ahead of future use of irrigation. Taking care of subsurface drainage, soil structure, SOC and functionality is the long-term means to maintain and improve sustainability and productivity, while the implementation of irrigation is a more flexible, one-off measure that requires short-term reactivity as an adaptation option.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare soil animal communities in planted birch (Betula pendula) stands of different origin with each other and with natural forests. Six 30-year-old birch stands were investigated, three planted after clear-cutting of spruce stands, and three planted on cultivated soil. The faunal communities were markedly different in plantations established on spruce forest soil and on arable soil. "Birch after Spruce" communities were relatively similar to those of coniferous forests, though the population densities were generally lower. "Birch after Field" communities were sparse and could be characterised as "impoverished forest communities", except in Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae that have affinities with deciduous forests and cultural landscapes. Soil conditions are not sufficient to explain the differences between the forests. Colonisation and transport by man may determine the presence of certain species, especially earthworms. These in turn affect soil properties, and compete with or otherwise have negative effects on other soil fauna. Thus the community differences between different forests are an outcome of several factors: soil characteristics, site history, colonisation ability and interspecific interactions.

AB  - The geothermal resources of most European countries have been estimated and compiled in the recently published Atlas of Geothermal Resources in Europe, a companion volume to the Atlas of Geothermal Resources in the European Community, Austria and Switzerland. Publication of this Atlas comes at a time when the promotion of a sustainable and non-polluting energy is high on the agenda of local energy suppliers, municipal administrations and all European governments. The participating countries are: Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UK. A volumetric heat content model for porous reservoirs was the basis for calculating the resources, assuming that exploitation of the geothermal resources would take place in a doublet well system. The geothermal reservoirs are defined in a set of 4 maps, by depth, thickness, temperature and resources. The assessment methodology is simple and is based on a small number of parameters so that regions with very limited data coverage can also be evaluated. An example is given in this paper of the eastern North German Basin. The maps presented in the Atlas permit a first order evaluation of the geothermal potential in terms of technical and economic viability. This uniform procedure applied to all countries and regions allows comparisons and serves as a guide for setting priorities and planning geothermal development. This Atlas also helps in the search for appropriate partners for international cooperation in geothermal exploration in Europe. (C) 2003 CNR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main aim of the study is to find out the potential allowable cut of energy wood at forest holding and regional level in Northern Save. The effect of price for energy wood on energy wood removals is also studied. Five alternative timber management strategies were produced for the non-industrial private forests (NIPF) landowners. The potential allowable cut of energy wood from NIPF in the district of Northern Save was calculated based on landowners' choices of timber management strategies.
   Almost 60% of the landowners chose the sustainability strategy as their timber production strategy for the following 20 year period. The profitably harvestable amount of energy wood more than doubles if costs are allowed to increase by 20 %, i.e. from 45 Fim/MWh to 55 Fim/MWh.

AB  - The article presents an analysis of the historical situation that arose when a relatively large number of migrant forest workers from Finland were offered permanent jobs and modern accommodation by a department of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget ('Swedish Cellulose Ltd.', or SCA) in the period 1950-1975. The aim here is to problematise the use of categories in intersectional studies, and to evaluate a working method that derives from individuals' own processes of differentiation. Two principal questions are addressed. What line should be taken on the use of categories in intersectional analysis? How best to use dialogic listening as the method in an open analysis of the subjectification processes?
   People relate to their classification, and their agency can also influence the categories to which they are ascribed. Yet as long as research acknowledges only one possible path of influence, from category to categorised, there is little chance it will recognise the significance the categorised might have for any changes to the categories. In order to study this process, I have gauged the success of a working method in which the construal of categorisation and differentiation is analysed on an individual level, using a close reading of narrated experience. This means exploring the space between named and naming in the creation of categories; analysing the oppression to which categorisations such as woman, working-class, and ethnic or national affiliation contribute, as previous research has shown; but above all by listening to how individuals 'make' themselves in relation to these social categories. With a point of departure in post-structuralism, the question becomes how the subjectification is made with respect to the subject-positions available in other words, what it is possible to be within the limitations of the dominant discourse in the hope of being able to trace gaps, additions, and negotiations in these processes. In order to study the question of bottom-up change of this kind, it is essential the subjectification is not thought wholly predictable or fixed. In the article an attempt is made to capture the interplay between position and identification; to capture the expression of enduring inequalities as well as openings for alternative differences and people's 'own' voices.
   In this sense the intersectional analysis is the result of an open search for processes of differentiation, partly aimed at reading history 'forwards', partly at analysing dominant discourses without reproducing them. It then becomes possible to identify the destabilisation of the discourses and the decentring of the subject. By countenancing a variety of answers to our interpellations, and by listening for answers to unspoken questions, we can restore as far as possible the right of self-description to those who rarely occupy a position from which to speak.
   If the researcher actively listens out for the categories used, their content, and the ways they are made significant in everyday parlance and narrated experiences, we can obtain the key to a broader, more inclusive, and perhaps even renewed narrative of the past. Conversely, a different spatial and temporal context - the Norrland forests of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s - can offer a certain distance to the present, with its conflicts born of identity politics, and thus contribute to a development of the intersectional perspective's theoretical and methodological potential.

AB  - In Latvia, livestock depredation by wolves has increased during the last two decades. Most of the attacks occur in summer and autumn during wolf hunting season. Use of effective preventive measures in Latvia is low, and farmers primarily rely on wolf hunting as a depredation reduction measure. The total numbers of wolf attacks and number of affected sheep per year in regional forest management units were analyzed in relation to the estimated wolf density, extent of culling, and proportion of juveniles, as well as the sheep density and estimated number of wild prey animals. The response variables (number of attacks and affected sheep per year) were modelled using a negative binomial regression, testing the effects of every covariate separately and building models from the significant covariates. The depredation level was related to sheep density and estimated wolf population size. No reducing effect was found for culling, and an even greater depredation rate was expected when the proportion of culled wolves increased. In addition, no significant effect was associated with the other covariates. However, greater numbers of affected sheep were expected at higher red deer density, suggesting increased opportunistic livestock depredation when red deer locally outcompete roe deer, the preferred wolf prey in Latvia.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore how the capacity to integrate environmental sustainability in Swedish regional development programming has evolved over time, particularly focusing on what facilitates and restricts change in different stages of implementation. The study builds on focus group and individual interviews in four Swedish regions carried out in 2005 and 2011. The results suggest temporary and partial, rather than enduring and substantial, environmental policy integration (EPI). In 2005 the main challenges were to allocate support, focus and prioritise beyond the national policy rhetoric of regional sustainable development, to identify regional applications beyond singular 'pockets of good practice' and to spread ownership and engagement for EPI from specific ambassadors to organisational mainstreaming. In 2011 we found evidence of a more mainstreamed approach of regional sustainable development, but with new challenges of policy diffusion and sectorisation as well as a strong sense of projectification. There is a need to develop arenas and processes for inter-sectoral exchange, interaction and learning to achieve a more systematic change - which is, in essence, what policy integration is all about.

AB  - The paper assesses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of forest bioenergy supply and utilization in Finland. Each step in the supply chains of harvesting residues (HR), small-diameter energy wood (EW) and stumps (ST) is assessed separately, with geography-related differences between Northern and Southern Finland (NF and SF) taken into consideration. Furthermore, the GHG performance of five distinct bioenergy options-(1) combined heat and power production, (2) condensing power production, (3) torrefied pellets, (4) gasification, and (5) pyrolysis oil production-is assessed and compared with that of current reference systems in Finland and also the European Union (EU) sustainability criteria. If soil carbon stock (SCS) changes and possible storage emissions are omitted, the GHG emissions deriving from the supply chain of comminuted forest biomass to plants are 2.4, 3.0, and 2.6 gCO(2)eq MJ(-1) for HR, EW, and ST in SF, respectively. In NE, the corresponding values are 2.9, 3.6, and 3.2 gCO(2)eq MJ(-1), respectively. If SCS changes and possible emissions from storage are accounted for, the emissions for HR, EW, and ST are in the ranges 9.2-49.2, 24.4-64.4, and 33.1-73.1 gCO(2)eq MJ(-1) in SF and 12.7-52.7, 29.4-69.4, and 39.5-79.5 gCO(2)eq MJ(-1) in NF. Most supply-chain GHG emissions arise from SCS changes and possible emissions from storage of comminuted biomass, both of which may involve significant uncertainty factors. In comparison to local reference systems, significant GHG savings can be achieved through energy utilization of forest biomass, but if SCS changes and, in particular, storage emissions are taken into account, fulfillment of the EU sustainability criteria is not guaranteed.

AB  - Designing the crosswalks at signalized intersections aims to facilitate pedestrians' safe crossing by preventing conflicts with motorized vehicles. However, pedestrian safety remains at high risk due to the signal violations by pedestrians at the intersections in India. The present study examines the violation of pedestrians at twelve signalized intersections in India. The study results show that approximately 44.6% of pedestrians arriving during the red phase violate the signals. The violation prevalence is high in the latter half of the red-light period. With the help of a multiple linear regression model, the relationship between various explanatory variables (i.e., individual characteristics and traffic conditions) and the violation prevalence has been established. Further, the pedestrian-vehicle conflicts during signal violation have been classified based on the yielding behaviour of pedestrians and road users. The yielding behaviour of the road users is found to vary in the beginning, middle, and end of the red phase. The study utilized the conflict indicator 'Post Encroachment Time' (PET) to determine the proximity of conflicts during violation. The severity levels of the conflict were determined with the help of the Swedish Traffic Conflict Technique (STCT) using 'Time to Accident' (TA) and 'Conflicting Speed' (CS). A generalized ordered logit model has been utilized to identify the factors (i.e., traffic conditions, personal characteristics, and situational characteristics) that affect the severity level of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. The results highlight the need for engineering countermeasures, education, and enforcement to deal with the noncompliance behaviour of pedestrians.

AB  - Native Sami people in northern Fennoscandia have used a wide range of native plant species for food and medicines throughout history. Plants and plant use are deeply embedded in the Sami traditions and subsistence in northern ecosystems. The overall aim of this study was to gain understanding of the Sami people's interaction with the herb Angelica archangelica in historical times and investigate if this use went beyond a pure opportunistic harvest of wild plants to include management of plants. To analyze this question, we combined studies of ethnographic information, an experimental field study, and discussions with a Sami woman with extended knowledge of Sami plant use. We suggest that the Sami people had a profound understanding of the complexity of the plant life-cycle. They dispersed seeds to favored areas and used harvest techniques intended not to deplete plant populations. The harvest experiment shows that it is possible to prolong the plant's life span by repeatedly harvesting infertile plants. A cross-disciplinary approach is needed to expand understanding of past plant use. Our results place overall Sami subsistence practices in a new light, as being cared for, managed, and sustainable.

AB  - In order to maximise profit and sustainability of a mining operation, knowledge of the chemistry, mineralogy, texture, and structure of the ore is essential. Continuous advancements in analytical techniques enable studying these features with increasing detail. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence is unparalleled in its simultaneously high spatial resolution and detection range. Yet, its application in ore geology research and the mining industry is still in its infancy. This study investigated opportunities of extreme-resolution synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping of ore samples. Analysis was performed at the NanoMAX beamline at the MAX IV synchrotron facility in Lund, Sweden. The samples investigated are from the Liikavaara Ostra Cu-(W-Au) deposit, northern Sweden. Analysis covered areas of several hundreds of mu m(2) in grains of molybdenite, pyrite, and native Bi. Key results included successful mapping of the lattice-bound distribution of Re, Se, and W in molybdenite at 200 nm spot/step size and detection of nanometre inclusions of Au in native Bi at 50 nm spot/step size. Challenges were encountered concerning data acquisition and processing. In order to achieve satisfactory resolution of both light and heavy elements and to limit mapping artefacts, repeated scans of the same area with varied experimental parameters and very thin (quasi-2d) samples are required. For complex geological samples, the software used for analysing spectral data (PyMCA) requires a considerable degree of human examination, which may be a source of error. Overall, synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping has a strong analytical potential for ore geology research, in analysing and imaging trace elements that would constitute potential by-products in mining operations. Detailed knowledge of how trace elements occur in the ores will inform the development of appropriate metal extraction programs thus ensuring that a larger part of the ore may then be utilized.

T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA  - Estonian
AB  - Over the course of the 17th century, a large number of persons connected to institutions of the Landesstaat (the local administration of the nobility) of Livland were descendants of the noble von Mengden family. This made the family under consideration in this article one of the most influential among families of its kind. While historical literature has hitherto focused primarily on the conflicts between Livland's nobility and Sweden's central state authorities, the aim of this article is to provide an example of cooperation between the two above-mentioned parties. To this end, we examine the activity of Otto and Engelbrecht, two influential members of the von Mengden family, in the civil service in the 1630s and 1640s. This was the time when the Knighthood of Livland was re-established after a pause of more than 30 years. Thus the results of this study also provide a certain insight into the background of the establishment of Livland's local self-administration.
   Otto von Mengden's cooperation with the Swedish central authorities was manifested primarily in his work as the captain (in German Rittmeister) of Livland's noble cavalry troop. By helping to drive out foreign forces that had invaded Livland in 1639 and by serving as commander of a company of the noble cavalry troop defending Livland's southern border in 1642 and 1643, Otto von Mengden proved to the state magistrates present in Livland that the fulfilment of such important tasks could be entrusted to him personally as well as to the rest of Livland's nobility. The fact that monetary support for the companies of the noble cavalry troop increased by leaps and bounds since 1638 confirms the fact that the central authorities were more and more willing to cooperate with the local nobility in matters of defence. While Otto von Mengden's cooperation with Governor General Bengt Oxenstierna was successful, he did not succeed in earning the trust of Queen Christina's regency government that resided in Stockholm. This prevented Otto von Mengden from realising his more ambitious plans.
   Engelbrecht von Mengden, on the other hand, was in well with local state magistrates in Livland as well as with the higher ranking members of the ruling elite of the Swedish state, which cleared the path for him to influential official positions in the civil service. This article examines Engelbrecht von Mengden's work as Commissar of Livland and Ingria (1638-1643), from which it emerges that among other things, Engelbrecht von Mengden's mission was to serve as mediator between the state authorities and Livland's nobility. Additionally, his position enabled him to submit ideas and proposals concerning Livland's nobility directly to the top-ranking leadership of the Swedish state, which the Commissar of Livland and Ingria indeed repeatedly did in his numerous letters to Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.
   Thus the activity of Otto and Engelbrecht von Mengden in the 1630s and 1640s demonstrates that in the period under consideration, the local nobility developed into a partner and not (yet) a rival in cooperation with the state authorities in administering Livland. In this light, it is also natural in every respect that the gradual institutionalisation of the Knighthood of Livland and the ever more vigorous rise in prominence of Livland's nobility in Livland's social life took place in parallel.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate transport priorities as a predictor over and above transport attitudes and situational factors, for the use of active and public transport (PT) to and from university among Norwegian university students in wintertime. A cross-sectional self-completion survey was carried out with 441 university students (229 females, 206 males), at two university campuses in Trondheim (Dragvoll and Gloshaugen), Norway. Transport priorities added to the explained variance above and beyond situational factors and transport attitudes. The transport priority of Exercise was associated with increased active transport use and the priority of flexibility was associated with decreased active transport use. In line with previous research, a more positive environmental attitude was related to increased active transport use as well. Among psychological factors, the transport attitude of comfort in PT, related to lower levels of PT use, possibly indicating dissatisfaction with using this mode. Overall, psychological factors (transport priorities, transport attitudes) contributed less explained variance of sustainable transport use, than situational factors (e.g. campus location, travel distance). Reminding students of the health and environmental benefits of active transport might be a promising way to promote this transport mode. Improving PT comfort might also promote continued usage of this mode in later life. However, increased sustainable transport mode use during winter appear to also depend on reducing situational constraints (e.g. clear snow on available walking and bicycling paths, improve infrastructure).

AB  - Forests have an important regulating function on water runoff and the occurrence of shallow landslides. Their structure and composition directly influence the risk of hydrogeomorphic processes, like floods with high sediment transport or debris flows. Climate change is substantially altering forest ecosystems, and for Central Europe an increase in natural disturbances from wind and insect outbreaks is expected for the future. How such changes impact the regulating function of forest ecosystems remains undear. By combining methods from forestry, hydrology and geotechnical engineering we investigated possible effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on shallow landslides. We simulated forest landscapes in two headwater catchments in the Eastern Alps of Austria under four different future climate scenarios over 200 years. Our results indicate that dimate-mediated changes in forest dynamics can substantially alter the protective function of forest ecosystems. Climate change generally increased landslide risk in our simulations. Only when future warming coincided with drying landslide risk decreased relative to historic conditions. In depth analyses showed that an important driver of future landslide risk was the simulated vegetation composition. Trajectories away from flat rooting Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) forests currently dominating the system towards an increasing proportion of tree species with heart and taproot systems, increased root cohesion and reduced the soil volume mobilized in landslides. Natural disturbances generally reduced landslide risk in our simulations, with the positive effect of accelerated tree species change and increasing root cohesion outweighing a potential negative effect of disturbances on the water cycle. We conclude that while the efficacy of green infrastructure such as protective forests could be substantially reduced by climate change, such systems also have a strong inherent ability to adapt to changing conditions. Forest management should foster this adaptive capacity to strengthen the protective function of forests also under changing environmental conditions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity causes spatial variation in disturbance regimes and resilience. We asked whether the resilience of bryophyte (liverwort and moss) assemblages to clear-cutting differs between streamside and upland boreal forests in northern Sweden. We hypothesized that bryophyte survival and recolonization rates are higher in streamside areas, thus raising resilience. Conversely, disturbance-intolerant but also invading species should be more frequent here, potentially reducing resilience. In each of 18 sites, we compared two 0.1-ha plots (one streamside and one upland) located in old forest that had never been clear-cut with two matching plots in young stands established after clear-cutting of old forests 30-50 years earlier. We used the magnitude of the difference in assemblages between old and young stands as a measure of change and, therefore, resilience (large difference implying low resilience). Species assemblages were more resilient in streamside than in upland forests. Species composition changed significantly in upland but not in streamside forests. Reductions in species richness were more pronounced in upland forests for total richness and for eight subgroups of species. Two results indicated lower survival/recolonization in upland forests: (1) species had a stronger association with old stands in upland areas, and (2) among species present in both the old streamside and old upland plot in a site, fewer appeared in the young upland than in the corresponding streamside plot. Simultaneously, a higher proportion of species invaded streamside areas; 40 of the 262 species encountered in streamside forests increased their occupancy by two or more sites compared to only two of 134 species in uplands. We suggest that in boreal forests spatial variation in resilience of assemblages of forest organisms intolerant of canopy removal is related to factors governed mainly by topography. More generally, we argue that landscape-scale variation in resilience of assemblages is influenced by spatial variation in (1) stress and resource availability, (2) number of disturbance-intolerant species, and (3) magnitude of environmental changes brought about by a disturbance with a specific intensity. We also suggest that rapid recovery in the short term does not necessarily imply higher long-term ability to return to the pre-disturbance state.

AB  - The UK dairy herd is predominantly of the Holstein-Friesian (HF) breed, with a major emphasis placed on milk yield. Subsequently, following years of continued single-trait selection, the beef production potential of dairy bred calves has declined. Thus, male HF calves are commonly seen as a by-product of the dairy industry. Limited markets, perceived low economic value and high rearing costs mean that these surplus calves are often euthanised shortly after birth or exported to the EU for further production. Welfare concerns have been raised regarding both euthanasia and long distance transportation of these calves. Furthermore, total UK beef consumption increased by 8.5% from 2009 to 2019. Thus, in light of this growing demand, beef from the dairy herd could be better utilized within the UK. Therefore, the potential for these calves to be used in a sustainable, cost-effective beef production system with high welfare standards within the UK requires investigation. Thus, the aim of this review was to evaluate both steer and bull beef production systems, examining the impact on performance, health, welfare, and economic potential to enable a sustainable farming practice, while meeting UK market requirements. The principal conclusions from this review indicate that there is the potential for these calves to be used in UK based production systems and meet market requirements. Of the steer production systems, a 24 month system appears to achieve a balance between input costs, growth from pasture and carcass output, albeit the literature is undecided on the optimum system. The situation is similar for bull beef production systems, high input systems do achieve the greatest gain in the shortest period of time, however, these systems are not sustainable in volatile markets with fluctuating concentrate prices. Thus, again the inclusion of a grazing period, may increase the resilience of these systems. Furthermore, production systems incorporating a period at pasture are seen to have animal welfare benefits. The main welfare concern for surplus dairy bred calves is often poor colostrum management at birth. While in steer systems, consideration needs to be given to welfare regarding castration, with the negative impacts being minimized by completing this procedure soon after birth.

AB  - indicator front-of-package nutrition labelling schemes are gaining momentum. In Europe, an example of such a scheme is Nutri-Score, which was first introduced in France. Supported by additional research, the scheme has the potential to expand into other countries. Such a scenario opens a series of questions related to the use of Nutri-Score in the territories with pre-existing food labelling schemes. A key question is whether different nutrition labelling schemes would provide conflicting information for consumers when applied to same foods. The goal of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the alignment of different front-of-package nutrition labelling schemes. The study was conducted using cross-sectional data on the composition of selected categories of prepacked foods with high penetration nutrition/health claims and symbols in the Slovenian food supply. We evaluated a variety of existing front-of-package nutrition labelling schemes: three interpretive nutrition rating systems (Nutri-Score, Health Star Rating (HSR), Traffic light system), four health symbols (Protective Food symbol, Choices, Finnish heart, and Keyhole symbol), and also three nutrient profile models developed for other purposes (Office of Communications (United Kingdom, Ofcom), World Health Organization Regional office for Europe (WHOE) and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)). Overall, our results indicate that interpretive nutrition rating systems (i.e., Nutri-Score) are mostly less strict than the nutrient profiles of tested health symbols. A risk of conflicting information would happen in a scenario where food is eligible to carry a health symbol, but is at the same time rated to have lower nutritional quality by an accompanying interpretive nutrition rating system. When Protective Food symbol and Nutri-Score are used together, this would occur for 5% of foods in our sample. To avoid such risks, schemes for health symbols could be adapted to be stricter than interpretive nutrition rating systems used in the same territory/market, but such adaptations are challenging and should be well planned. While our study showed that, in most cases, Nutri-Score is a less strict model than tested health symbols, the rating-system approach might offer useful support and incentive for food producers towards gradual food reformulation.

AB  - Ecological stability encompasses multiple dimensions of functional and compositional responses to environmental change. Though no single stability dimension used in isolation can fully reflect the overall response to environmental change, a common vulnerability assessment that integrates simultaneously across multiple stability components is highly desirable for ecological risk assessment. We develop both functional and compositional counterparts of a novel, integrative metric of overall ecological vulnerability (OEV). We test the framework with data from a modularized experiment replicated in five lakes over two seasons, examining functional and compositional responses to both pulse and press disturbances across three trophic groups. OEV is measured as the area under the curve integrated over the entire observation period, with the curve delimiting the difference between the disturbance treatment and undisturbed parallel controls, expressed either as the log response ratio of biomass (functional OEV) or community dissimilarity index (compositional OEV). Both, functional and compositional OEV correlated negatively with functional and compositional 'resistance', 'temporal stability' and 'final/extent of recovery' following both pulse and press disturbances, though less so with 'resilience' following a pulse disturbance. We also found a positive correlation between functional and compositional OEV, which reveals the potential to also evaluate the intricate linkage between biodiversity and functional change. Our findings demonstrate that OEV comprises a robust framework to: (a) capture simultaneously multiple functional and compositional stability components, and (b) quantify the functional consequences of biodiversity change. Our results provide the basis for an overarching framework for quantifying the overall vulnerability of ecosystems to environmental change, opening new possibilities for ecological risk assessment and management. Synthesis. Ecological stability comprises multiple dimensions that together encapsulate how ecosystems respond to environmental change. Considering these multiple aspects of stability simultaneously often poses a problem in environmental assessments, which frequently require overarching indicators of risk or vulnerability. While an analysis of multiple dimensions allows for deeper exploration of mechanisms, here we develop and test a new univariate indicator that integrates stability aspects under a broad range of disturbance regimes. Using a modularized experiment in Swedish lakes, we show that this integrative measure captures multiple stability dimensions reflecting compositional and functional vulnerability and their relationships between them.

AB  - The importance of assessing socio-economic and sustainability aspects of genetically modified (GM) crops is increasingly recognized by policy-makers, both within the EU and internationally. Nevertheless, experience has shown that it is challenging to assess and implement these aspects in actual decision-making processes. This paper argues that stakeholder engagement may provide valuable insights when developing frameworks for sustainability assessment of GM crops. We organized two stakeholder workshops with the aim to gather perspectives on the sustainability of cultivating late blight resistant (LBR) GM potato in Norway. Sixteen Norwegian stakeholders involved in potato production and in agriculture in general took part in the workshops. Here, we present and discuss the outcomes of this participatory approach. The stakeholders identified several conditions that an LBR GM potato ought to satisfy in order to contribute to sustainable development. These conditions concerned environmental and health safety aspects of cultivating LBR GM potato, potential for fungicide reductions, durability of the LBR GM potato plant's resistance, farmers' profitability and consumer acceptance. In addition, the stakeholders considered issues such as maintenance of a diversity of potato cultivars, transparency during product development and risk assessment processes, ownership and control and opportunity for independent risk research as important considerations in a sustainability assessment. While focusing on a specific application of agricultural biotechnology, we believe that these findings are useful contributions to the ongoing efforts to develop frameworks and guidelines for assessing sustainability and socio-economic considerations of GM crops in general.

AB  - Several waste management (WM) professionals see an ongoing shift in the focus of the industry, from that of a transport and treatment sector to that of a more integrated sustainable service provision and material production sector. To further develop such transitional ambitions, WM organizations are increasingly looking toward inter organizational resource network concepts (such as the circular economy and industrial symbiosis) as models of how they would like to create new value together with their customers and partners.
   This article aims to take a step in addressing uncertainties behind such transitions by analyzing barriers for inter-organizational resource management and in turn uncovering some potential opportunities and risks of novel offerings from the WM sector. Obstacles for developing innovative inter-organizational resource networks have been identified based on studies of implementing industrial symbiosis networks. Subsequently, managing executives from Swedish private and public WM organizations were interviewed regarding the sector's capacity to overcome such barriers opportunities and risks of providing new resource management services and how their organizations might approach the role of actively facilitating more resource efficient regions.
   Eco-Industrial park management and contracting out holistic resource management are some areas in which the respondents see WM organizations offering new services. In relation to such approaches, various risks (e.g. being cut out of investment benefits, or unstable supply) and opportunities (e.g. new markets and enhanced sustainability profiles) were identified. Additionally, it was seen that WM companies would need to make substantial changes to their business approach, becoming less dependent on flows of mixed materials for example, if they are to become even more central value chain actors. To strengthen such approaches, it was seen that the sector will need to find methods to strategically build strong, long term partnerships, expand upon and take advantage of available knowledge resources (i.e. best practice technologies and regional material flows), and explore new business models (i.e. stockpiling, park management, or waste minimization). Additionally, working with sector representatives to argue for a more balanced market conditions next to primary production should assist the viability of new offerings in the wider market.

AB  - The large arionid slug Arion vulgaris is an invasive pest dispersing through large parts of Europe and causing considerable damage in gardens, horticulture and agriculture. It is also possible that this so-called "Iberian slug" has an impact on Norwegian ecosystems, displacing or hybridizing with the native black slug Arion ater. The taxonomy of the large arionids is complex and confusing, encompassing different anatomical forms and colour varieties. The present study integrates, for the first time, coloration, ligula morphology, genital morphometry, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in order to differentiate the large arionids found in Norway, Arion vulgaris, Arion ater and A. rufus. These data revealed a clear separation between Arion vulgaris and Arion ater based on the morphology of the genitalia and mtDNA. However, introgression with the red slug A. rufus was apparent in approximately half of the Arion ater specimens analysed, evidenced by ligula morphology, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. In addition, the mitochondrial COI gene and the nuclear ITS1 gene suggested introgression between Arion ater and Arion vulgaris. Phylogenetic analyses that included Arion vulgaris, Arion ater and A. rufus from other parts of Europe, together with A. flagellus, A. fuscus, A. lusitanicus and A. nobrei suggest that Arion vulgaris is more closely related to Arion ater and A. rufus than to A. lusitanicus. This study confirms the uncertainty of identification based solely on coloration and stresses the importance of integrating several approaches to differentiate these large arionids, allowing a better appreciation of their invasive potential, ecological impact and current distribution.

AB  - Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus is one of the most important commercial species in the Mediterranean. This study focused on its feeding ecology in an important fishing ground within the Adriatic Sea, using an integrated approach of stomach content (SCA) and stable isotope (SIA) analyses. The simultaneous use of these tools represents a modern and complete approach that provides reliable data over time and reflects the feeding strategy of the analysed species. Monthly sampling was carried out (January-December 2019, July and October 2020; 589 specimens) to investigate seasonal changes in diet and trophic level. Variations in fullness, gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices were analysed to explore changes in feeding and variations in energy requirements linked to reproductive needs. Results showed that N. norvegicus mostly prey on decapod crustaceans and fish. Seasonal variations in prey consumption were likely linked to the reproductive patterns of the species. SIA results confirmed SCA findings and placed N. norvegicus at a high position within the benthic food web. Overall, considering that the Adriatic Sea represents one of the most important and productive fishing areas for Norway lobster, this study provides critical information for an effective ecosystem approach to fisheries management of this resource.

AB  - Urban air consists of a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate species from anthropogenic and biogenic sources that are further processed in the atmosphere. This study investigated the characteristics and sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and submicron organic aerosol (OA) in a traffic environment in Helsinki, Finland, in late summer. The anthropogenic VOCs (aVOCs; aromatic hydrocarbons) and biogenic VOCs (bVOCs; terpenoids) relevant for secondary-organic-aerosol formation were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, whereas the composition and size distribution of submicron particles was measured with a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer.This study showed that aVOC concentrations were significantly higher than bVOC concentrations in the traffic environment. The largest aVOC concentrations were measured for toluene (campaign average of 1630 ng m(-3)) and p/m xylene (campaign average of 1070 ng m(-3)), while the dominating bVOC was alpha-pinene (campaign average of 200 ng m(-3)). For particle-phase organics, the campaign-average OA concentration was 2.4 mu g m(-3). The source apportionment analysis extracted six factors for OA. Three OA factors were related to primary OA sources - traffic (24 % of OA, two OA types) and a coffee roastery (7 % of OA) - whereas the largest fraction of OA (69 %) consisted of oxygenated OA (OOA). OOA was divided into less oxidized semi-volatile OA (SV-OOA; 40 % of OA) and two types of low-volatility OA (LV-OOA; 30 %).The focus of this research was also on the oxidation potential of the measured VOCs and the association between VOCs and OA in ambient air. Production rates of the oxidized compounds (OxPR) from the VOC reactions revealed that the main local sources of the oxidation products were O3 oxidation of bVOCs (66 % of total OxPR) and OH radical oxidation of aVOCs and bVOCs (25 % of total OxPR). Overall, aVOCs produced a much smaller portion of the oxidation products (18 %) than bVOCs (82 %). In terms of OA factors, SV-OOA was likely to originate from biogenic sources since it correlated with an oxidation product of monoterpene, nopinone. LV-OOA consisted of highly oxygenated long-range or regionally transported OA that had no correlation with local oxidant concentrations as it had already spent several days in the atmosphere before reaching the measurement site.In general, the main sources were different for VOCs and OA in the traffic environment. Vehicle emissions impacted both VOC and OA concentrations. Due to the specific VOCs attributed to biogenic emissions, the influence of biogenic emissions was more clearly detected in the VOC concentrations than in OA. In contrast, the emissions from the local coffee roastery had a distinctive mass spectrum for OA, but they could not be seen in the VOC measurements due to the measurement limitations for the large VOC compounds. Long-range transport increased the OA concentration and oxidation state considerably, while its effect was observed less clearly in the VOC measurements due to the oxidation of most VOC in the atmosphere during the transport. Overall, this study revealed that in order to properly characterize the impact of different emission sources on air quality, health, and climate, it is of importance to describe both gaseous and particulate emissions and understand how they interact as well as their phase transfers in the atmosphere during the aging process.

AB  - This study examined appropriate design of efficient climate taxes on consumption of food by constructing a simple theoretical model and exemplifying the results using the examples of tomatoes and beef in Sweden. The theoretical results showed that, for the tax to be efficient, i) existing taxes on greenhouse gases (GHGs) should be considered when calculating the climate impact in order to avoid double taxation, and ii) taxes should be differentiated between GHG (here carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) because of their differing climate impacts. The calculations of climate taxes on tomatoes and beef in Sweden indicated considerable differences in the tax level depending on whether conditions (i) and (ii) were considered or not. The commonly applied approach in the literature on climate taxes on food, i.e. taxing carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) using global warming potential over 100 years (GWP(100)) and neglecting existing taxes on GHG emissions, results in a tax that is 1.4-2.8 times higher than the efficient tax for tomatoes and a tax that is between 30% lower and 20% higher than the efficient tax for beef. Despite the relatively low variations in the climate tax on beef, estimated reduction in emissions from beef ranged between 23% and 35% depending on choice of tax. The price increases on food due to a climate tax and associated effects on emissions can thus show large variation depending on the tax calculation method. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Although an important part of the ecosystem, large wild herbivores (LWH), especially red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), cause significant damage to economically valuable timber in forests of Central Europe. Recent work has demonstrated that less valuable softwood broadleaved trees can act as "biological control" that helps reduce bark browsing on more valuable trees in a mixed stand. To better understand the factors that influence how much bark area and mass are removed by LWH from these broadleaved trees, we took advantage of a novel "natural" experiment that occurred after a breach in a herbivory exclosure surrounding a 10-year old mixed broadleaved/conifer stand in the Western Carpathians in north-western Slovakia. We measured the area of old (up to 2 years previously) and new browsed patches on stems of common aspen (Populus tremula L.), common rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) and goat willow (Salix caprea L.), and their position along the vertical profile of the stem. The browsed bark area (cm(2)) was then converted to the bark mass (g) removed and the proportion of browsed bark to total bark (%) using conversion equations. Our models demonstrated that the amount of bark removed was influenced by tree species, stem diameter, age of browsing (old vs. new), and stem section along the vertical profile. LWH removed the most bark area from willow but the most bark mass from aspen because aspen had thicker bark than the other tree species. Bark browsing was greater on trees > 6 cm basal diameter. The distribution of bark browsing along the vertical profile was symmetrical (unimodal) with maximum intensity at 101-125 cm from the ground, which corresponds with the height most optimal for feeding by red deer. However, previous browsing in 2019 and 2020 caused new browsing on willow in 2021 to be focused in stem sections lower (51-75 cm) and higher (126-150 cm) than that optima. By quantifying browsing patterns and the amount of bark that is accessible to LWH for forage on the most attractive softwood broadleaved trees, our work will contribute to developing better methods for protecting commercially important species such as European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in areas of Central Europe that are greatly affected by increasing population density of LWH, especially red deer.

AB  - 1. We examined species-environment relationships and community concordance between aquatic bryophytes and insects in boreal springs. We sampled bryophytes (Marchantiophyta and Bryophyta), benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables in 138 springs in Finland, spanning a latitudinal gradient of 1000 km. Macroinvertebrates were subdivided into two groups: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera (EPTC taxa) and chironomid midges (Diptera; Chironomidae). Our aim was to test whether EPTC taxa could be used as surrogates in biodiversity surveys and bioassessment for the two less-well known organism groups, chironomids and bryophytes.
   2. Bryophyte assemblages were clearly differentiated along gradients in thermal conditions and water chemistry (pH, conductivity). Chironomids and EPTC were also differentiated in relation to thermal conditions and, to a lesser extent, physical habitat variables, but were only weakly associated to spring water chemistry. Chironomids and EPTC assemblages were more concordant with each other than with bryophytes, but all concordances were relatively weak.
   3. Our results suggest that even if the overall compositional patterns of the three taxonomic groups were significantly concordant, the relative importance of environmental drivers underlying their community compositions differed strongly. The results thus imply that spring bryophytes and insects are relatively poor surrogates for each other. The proportion of spring specialists was highest in bryophytes, promoting their primacy for spring bioassessment and biodiversity conservation. We suggest that adequate variation in water chemistry be assured to protect spring bryophyte biodiversity, whereas preserving the physical variation of springs is more important for macroinvertebrates.

AB  - We investigated benthic foraminiferal assemblages in contaminated sediments in a subarctic harbor of Northern Norway to assess their utility as indicators of anthropogenic impacts. Sediments in the harbor are repositories for POPs and heavy metals supplied through discharges from industry and shipping activities. Sediment contaminant concentrations are at moderate to poor ecological quality status (EcoQS) levels. The EcoQS based on benthic foraminiferal diversity reflects a similar trend to the EcoQS based on contaminant concentrations. Foraminiferal density and diversity is low throughout the harbor with distinct assemblages reflecting influence of physical disturbances or chemical stressors. Assemblages impacted by physical disturbance are dominated by L. lobatula and E. excavatum, while assemblages impacted by chemical stressors are dominated by opportunistic species S. fusiformis, S. biformis, B. spathulata and E. excavatum. The foraminiferal assemblage from an un-impacted nearby fjord consists mainly of agglutinated taxa These assemblages provides a valuable baseline of the ecological impacts of industrialization in northern coastal communities.

AB  - Research Highlights: Determination of merchantable wood volume is one of the key preconditions for sustainable forest management. This study explores accuracy of calibrated predictions of merchantable wood volume of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) using stem taper curves (STC) in a form of a mixed model. Background and Objectives: The study is devoted to the determination of merchantable wood volume (over bark) of individual standing stems based on the integration of an STC model calibrated using upper diameter measurements. Various options of upper diameter measurement were tested and their impact on the accuracy of merchantable wood volume prediction was evaluated. Materials and Methods: To model stem taper curves, a Kozak 02 function was applied in a form of a nonlinear, mixed effects model. Accuracies of calibrated merchantable wood volume predictions obtained through remote (optical) upper diameter measurements were compared to accuracies corresponding to contact measurements by a caliper. The performance of two alternative methods used in the Czech National Forest Inventory (NFI) and forestry practice, involving diameter at breast height and total tree height as the only predictors, were also tested. The contact measurements were performed at identical stem positions after felling the respective sample tree. The calibration was done in order to account for factors inherent in particular location, and, optionally, also in a particular sample stem (within the respective location). Input data was sourced as part of a dedicated survey involving the entire territory of the Czech Republic. In total, 716 individual spruce trees were measured, felled and analysed at 169 locations. Results: In general, the best merchantable volume predictions were obtained by integrating the STC fitted (and calibrated) by minimising errors of stem cross-sectional areas instead of diameters. In terms of calibrated predictions, using single-directional, caliper measurement of upper diameter at 7 m (after felling) led to the best accuracy. In this case, the observed mean bias of merchantable volume prediction was only 0.63%, indicating underestimation. The best optical calibration strategy involved upper diameter measurements at two heights (5 and 7 m) simultaneously. Bias of this volume prediction approach was estimated at 2.1%, indicating underestimation. Conclusions: Concerning the prediction of merchantable stem volume of standing Norway spruce trees, STC calibration using two optical upper diameter measurements (at 5 and 7 m) was found to be practically applicable, provided a bias up to 3.7% can be accepted. This method was found to be more accurate than the existing national alternatives using diameter at breast height and the total tree height as the only predictors.

AB  - In the course of forest decline studies in the last decade a multitude of bioindication methods has been developed. This article is a short review on selected methods used in the TEMPUS program: Passive monitoring by lichens, either in form of reactive bioindication for the assessment of stress impact on forest ecosystems or in form of accumalitve indication for monitoring of heavy metals is still an important tool in forestry. Plant cultivars particularly sensitive to certain pollutants can be used for active monitoring concepts. Forest trees, especially Norway spruce, are widely used as indication plants: Besides the commonly applied forest monitoring systems based on visual classification of canopies, we describe the use of physiological parameters of spruce needles for bioindication of stresses including non-accumulating influences.

AB  - Knowing the displacement capacity and mobility patterns of industrially exploited (i.e., fished) marine resources is key to establishing effective conservation management strategies in human-impacted marine ecosystems. Acquiring accurate behavioral information of deep-sea fished ecosystems is necessary to establish the sizes of marine protected areas within the framework of large international societal programs (e.g., European Community H2020, as part of the Blue Growth economic strategy). However, such information is currently scarce, and high-frequency and prolonged data collection is rarely available. Here, we report the implementation of autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles as an aid for acoustic long-baseline localization systems for autonomous tracking of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), one of the key living resources exploited in European waters. In combination with seafloor moored acoustic receivers, we detected and tracked the movements of 33 tagged lobsters at 400-m depth for more than 3 months. We also identified the best procedures to localize both the acoustic receivers and the tagged lobsters, based on algorithms designed for off-the-shelf acoustic tags identification. Autonomous mobile platforms that deliver data on animal behavior beyond traditional fixed platform capabilities represent an advance for prolonged, in situ monitoring of deep-sea benthic animal behavior at meter spatial scales.

AB  - One of many measures to prevent or at least mitigate damage to cultural heritage sites is to make a salvage plan for items with heritage value. Several guides and manuals have been written for museums to help in the work of ascribing values to their collections. A review of international work on emergency response planning, salvaging of items and detailed information on preventive work shows that only two guidelines mention how to prioritise heritage items when making a salvage plan. This article combines relevant guides and manuals with experiences from projects undertaken in Norwegian churches. It presents a roadmap that can be used by non-professionals in their work on salvage plans. The roadmap contains all steps from preparation and background work, to relevant discussions and assessment of heritage items, in combination with the definition of salvage needs and of the vulnerability of the valuated items. By including when and how to involve the needed experts, this article offers a tool that fills a gap for the management and the owners of cultural historical buildings.

AB  - Many grasses (Poaceae) have symbiotic fungal endophytes, which affect livestock by producing unpalatable or harmful secondary compounds. Less is known about the repelling effects of fungal endophytes on avian grazers despite potential wildlife management implications. Herbivorous goose (Branta spp.) species may become a nuisance in recreational use areas via fecal littering. Planting these areas with grasses that avian grazers avoid may help mitigate this damage. In 2016, we studied the foraging preference of the barnacle geese (B. leucopsis) with endophytic (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) red fescue (Festuca rubra) and/or tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) in 2 sites in Finland that had a history of nuisance geese damage. In the high grazing pressure site, we planted both grass species, while in the low grazing pressure site only tall fescue was used. Geese preference was measured as the percentage of the area grazed, the height of the residual grass grazed, and the number of fecal droppings in the grass plots. Geese foraging did not differ between E- and E+ grasses, but red fescues were preferred over tall fescues. This supports previous findings that tall fescues or other coarse species could reduce the attractiveness of recreational areas to geese.

AB  - E-scooters, one of the most rapidly growing forms of micromobility globally, entered our cities as an innovative first and last-mile travel mode looking to complement public transit and reduce short car trips. However, there are many voices openly suggesting that e-scooters, despite representing still a very low modal share, have instead been the source of traffic accidents, transport system disruption and public space anarchy. Despite a wealth of e-scooter research appearing lately, knowledge gaps about e-scooters' current reputation and how this matches actual user and non-user perceptions do exist. Our two-phase mixed method approach means to fill in these gaps by examining the intriguing context of Sweden, a country hosting more than 30 million e-scooter trips on an annual basis but recently enforcing new stricter rules for their regulation. This paper contributes to the state of the art by contextualising the current reputation of e-scooters in Sweden through a discourse analysis of local press items and by analysing an attitudinal survey that ran in Stockholm and Gothenburg with almost equal numbers of e-scooter users and nonusers. First our news item analysis identifies six reputation-defining themes: cityscape fit; traffic safety and irresponsible user behaviour; rules, regulations and exploits; business; sustainability; and convenience and concludes that e-scooters' portrayal in Sweden is very negative. There are approximately five negative comments in the press for every positive one. Our survey offers statistical evidence that there are significant differences in the evaluations of users and non-users when it comes to seven perceived e-scooter qualities (safety; speed; eco-friendliness; cost; convenience; fun; health and wellbeing) and two policy practicalities (regulations clarity; and parking provision). Users' perceptions are always more positive from those of non-users, but they do agree with them that safety, eco-friendliness, cost, health and wellbeing are areas of concern for escooters. Both groups see value in enhanced regulation clarity and better parking provision. Nonusers however, to some degree, do recognise that e-scooters offer fast, convenient and pleasant mobility services making this the tripole where image change and positive rebranding could start from.

AB  - Plant invasions threaten native biodiversity, but detailed information on patterns and mechanisms of diversity changes across multitrophic levels remains unknown. Alien plants can reduce richness of native plants, thereby negatively affecting arthropods and their multitrophic interactions. In particular, tall invasive trees may limit native understory plants and associated arthropods more than small invasive shrubs, which may support light-demanding taxa under their more open canopies. In this study, we investigated how two non-native highly invasive species (shrub Sorbaria sorbifolia and tree Amelanchier spicata) and two native species (shrub Rubus idaeus and tree Prunus padus) distributed in monodominant patches along roadsides in SW Finland affect arthropod-feeding guild biomass and food webs. Under trees, regardless of their origin, the diversity and biomass of understory plants and arthropods living in the canopy and on the ground was significantly reduced compared to shrubs, which had higher biodiversity and more significant interactions between feeding guilds and understory plants. The higher biomass of native understory plants increased the abundance of herbivores under the shrubs, and thus indirectly predators. The species richness of understory plants determined the richness of saprophagous organisms in native stands. We conclude that more open roadside shrub canopies support greater plant and arthropod biodiversity and more complex food web structures compared to shady tree stands, and that alien shrubs do not necessarily reduce arthropod biodiversity. The study opens up the possibility of predicting arthropod composition and biomass using functional attributes of understory vegetation and the origin, physiognomy and species identity of overstory dominants.

AB  - This study examines the perspectives of Swedish undergraduate students regarding potential conflicts between ownership rights and environmental protection. Conceptions of ?ownership? are relevant in relation to the environment and environmental protection as they can highlight a more transboundary relationship between the individual/society and nature. Students studying economics, law and political science were chosen because of their potential future transformative roles as decision makers and policy makers. Content analysis was employed to examine the written responses of 747 students from seven different universities to the open-ended survey question: Can ownership rights and environmental protection come into conflict? Students? responses were measured twice: at the very beginning of the first semester and then again at the end of the semester. The results show that students expressed a dominant view of ownership in terms of individual ownership, and associations to collective ownership were largely absent. In regards to the potential conflict between ownership rights and environmental protection, most students perceived such a conflict, and it was more common for the environment to be conceptualised as the losing party rather than the landowner. More research is needed regarding how teaching and instruction can deal with the potential conflicts between ownership (private/corporate/governmental) and environmental protection.

AB  - The current study's main objective is to apply energy, exergy, & sustainability analysis and provide suggestions to improve the sustainability of the commercial sector of Bangladesh. Data from 2000 to 2014 is analyzed, and it is found that the estimated energy efficiencies range from 65.42% to 68.5%, while exergy efficiencies range from 10.79% to 11.49%. Depletion number, sustainability index, lack of productivity, relative irreversibility, waste exergy ratio, environmental effect factor, & environmental destruction coefficient are utilized as sustainability indicators. From the study, it is found that sustain ability index varies between 1.12 and 1.13, while relative irreversibility varies between 0.44 and 0.53. Lack of productivity is found to be higher for cooking appliances and varies from 3.52 to 4.06. Waste exergy ratio and environmental effect factor are found to be higher for electrical appliances. For electrical appliances, waste exergy ratio varies from 0.42 to 0.50 and environmental effect factor varies from 3.5 to 4.55. Environmental destruction coefficient reaches as high as 9.27. It is determined that Bangladesh's commercial sector is more sustainable compared to Turkey, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia but less sustainable than Norway, and Sweden. Utilization of energy efficient lighting, waste energy management, and replacing gas-fired cooking stoves with electrical appliances are provided as recommendations to reduce exergy loss. The study outcome reveals that increasing exergy efficiencies can ensure a sustainable commercial sector. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maritime transport faces increasing pressure to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to be in accordance with the Paris Agreement. For this to happen, low- and zero-carbon energy solutions need to be developed. In this paper we draw on sustainability transition literature and introduce the technological innovation system (TIS) framework to the field of maritime transportation research. The TIS approach analytically distinguishes between different innovation system functions that are important for new technologies to develop and diffuse beyond an early phase of experimentation. This provides a basis for technology-specific policy recommendations. We apply the TIS framework to the case of battery-electric and hydrogen energy solutions for coastal maritime transport in Norway. Whereas both battery-electric and hydrogen solutions have developed rapidly, the former is more mature and has a strong momentum. Public procurement and other policy instruments have been crucial for developments to date and will be important for these technologies to become viable options for shipping more generally.

AB  - The data from two scientific surveys, where eel is part of the catch, have been studied to assess trends in recruitment and escapement to and from the Baltic. Abundance of juvenile eel was monitored in the Sound, between Sweden and Denmark, from 1992 to 2002. The total natural recruitment of new eels was estimated under the assumption that the number of juvenile eels observed in the surveys represented an accumulation of eels migrating into the Baltic. To assess the total recruitment, the stocking by imported glass eels, or transplanted juveniles from outside the Baltic, was added. Fish larvae monitoring at a nuclear power plant in the Kattegat gave an index of glass eel abundance which was well correlated with glass eel monitoring in the Sound. This was used to extrapolate the recruitment time-series to the full period from 1981 to the present. The main conclusions from the analysis were: (i) the recruitment to the Baltic region, including the contribution from stocking, has declined by 95% between 1981 and 2012. (ii) The stocking of glass eel and bootlace eel has been of the same order of magnitude as natural recruitment, averaging 25-30% of the total supply of glass eel to the Baltic, with a decreasing trend with time. (iii) The total landings in the Baltic countries have ranged from 5 to 15% of the estimated survival without anthropogenic mortality. This proportion has been stable and independent of a large decrease in potential escapement.

AB  - About 3600 tonnes food waste are discarded in the landfills in Hong Kong daily. It is expected that the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong will be exhausted by 2020. In consideration of the food waste management environment and community needs in Hong Kong, as well as with reference to the food waste management systems in cities such as Linkoping in Sweden and Oslo in Norway, a framework of food waste separation, collection, and recycling for food waste valorization is proposed in this paper. Food waste can be packed in an optic bag (i.e., a bag in green color), while the residual municipal solid waste (MSW) can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations, in which food waste is separated from the residual MSW using an optic sensor. On the one hand, the sorted food waste can be converted into valuable materials (e.g., compost, swine feed, fish feed). On the other hand, the sorted food waste can be sent to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities and sewage treatment works for producing biogas. The biogas can be recovered to produce electricity and city gas (i.e., heating fuel for cooking purpose). Due to the challenges faced by the value-added products in Hong Kong, the biogas is recommended to be upgraded as a biogas fuel for vehicle use. Hopefully, the proposed framework will provide a simple and effective approach to food waste separation at source and promote sustainable use of waste to resource in Hong Kong.

AB  - Research on the relations among business travel, work, and family domains has been limited. To address this issue, this study examined the influence of business travel on work-family conflict and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout, using the Job Demands-Resources perspective. The study was conducted in a large Norwegian oil and gas company, and to overcome the limitations of self-reported data on business travel frequency, the company's business travel database was utilized in the study. The response rate was 68% (n=2093). The results revealed that business travel frequency and control over travel explained a significant proportion of the variance in work-family conflict, but not in emotional exhaustion. However, work-family conflict was found to be a mediator in the business travel-emotional exhaustion relationship. Moreover, the results revealed significant differences in work-family conflict related to travel pattern among groups of travellers, but no differences in emotional exhaustion. Commuters reported the highest degree of work-family conflict. Practical implications and the consequences of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine and highlight the motivations underlying the consumption of local food. The study has been conducted through an exploratory survey carried out in two European regions, both with a borderland character, namely Jamtland in Northern Sweden and Calabria in Southern Italy. These marginal regions lie far from the heart of Europe. They are rich in uncontaminated landscape beauty and gastronomic deposits, with famous traditional dishes. Indeed, with their local landscape cultural mosaics, they can be seen as lost paradises. Using the Multiple Correspondences Analysis (MCA) method, we identified characteristics and motivational profiles of consumers in Sweden and Calabria, capturing differences and similarities that enable a transnational comparison of the case study contexts. The results highlight the strong link between gastronomy, consumption of local food, and the territory.

AB  - In southern Sweden, nutrient runoff from agricultural areas causes extensive eutrophication of inland and coastal waters. To reduce nutrient transport, especially nitrogen, resource managers are creating wetlands and ponds within stream system,;. During 1996 and 1997, we studied the migration of smolts of brown trout Salmo trutta through one of these artificial,ponds, Situated in Onnerupsbacken Creek in southern Sweden. Because the former migration route through the stream was severed, migration through the pond was compared with an upstream reference section in the stream. Smolts were captured by a smolt trap about 2 km upstream of the pond and marked with electronic passive integrated transponders before being released into the stream. Downstream of the smolt trap, loss rate, swimming speed, and timing of movements of the brown trout were measured in the reference stream section and in the pond as the smolts passed each of three submerged antennae placed in the stream and at the pond's inlet and outlet. We found that the median time it took the tagged smolts to swim a stream length of 1,280 in (first and second antennae) was 4 h in 1996 and 23 h in 1997. Most movement (75%) occurred between 2100 and 0400 hours. The loss rate in the stream was estimated to be 23% and 42% for 1996 and 1997, respectively. The shortest distance across the pond was 285 m, and the median time required for swimming through the pond (second and third antennae) was 52 h in 1996 and 26 It in 1997. Compared with the results in the stream, the timing of movement out of the pond was evenly spread over the day, and the loss rate was estimated to 81.5% and 77% for 1996 and 1997, respectively. Thus, migration time was slower and mortality rate was higher than in the stream section, presumably due to predation in the pond. Although we cannot make any conclusions about how migration has been altered by the pond relative to the former stream route, the differences in migration between the pond and the reference section suggest that there may be negative impacts of new lentic habitats that outweigh the gains achieved by the remedial measure.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to raise and explore some of the challenges we as gender scholars have experienced in Sweden today in what could be conceptualized as 'overed' academic landscapes. Our argument is framed by Sara Ahmed's (2012) statement that the very idea that we are 'over race' is how racism is reproduced where it also has to be emphasized that the notion of being 'over race' needs to be understood as intertwined with being over gender. With autobiographical methods, we take leverage in a problematization of gender studies as 'a room of our own' and discuss related themes in academe such as the paradox of gender studies as a perspective and/or a discipline, pluralism and the academic institutional division of labour, feminism and neoliberal New Public Management, collaborative interdisciplinary work in audit cultures. The paper concludes with a discussion about resisting 'overing' through the conflicted position of the feminist scholar. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study critically analyses the emerging Slow Flower Movement in a Swedish context. Analysis is conducted by using the Triple-layered Business Model Canvas, covering economic, social and environmental sustainability values. Data are collected (Spring 2021) through semi-structured interviews, observations of cultivation and use of social media. Analysis and coding were conducted by applying thematic analysis. The results show that con-sumer demand and market for domestic cut-flowers are increasing; however, the development is hindered by small scale production, low profitability and demanding work conditions. Results also show that produce, in line with the Slow Flower Movement, provides unique sustainable values: contribution to biodiversity, a different and unique assortment, functions as a meeting point, and contributes to the local culture, landscape and society. Social media represent a crucial tool in sales, marketing and communication, as well as in the overall development of the movement. Highlighting how these technological communication platforms constitute a foundation for the movement's establishment. The avoidance of technical production aid in the cultivation is regarded as a main hindrance to developing the firms and profitability. By initiating knowledge exchange between conventional growers and the emerging Slow Flower Movement, both parties are expected to gain advantages of a trans-formation towards a mutual development of sustainable domestic cut-flower production.

AB  - Millions of tonnes of shredder fines are disposed of annually across the world. In Sweden, fines are primarily utilised in landfill covering. Given the decreasing landfilling and the increasing environmental concerns, the valorisation of this residue is becoming ever important. In order to guide sustainable investment decisions and governance of fines valorisation, this study aimed to assess the environmental potential of different valorisation alternatives. In doing so, three conceptual valorisation process schemes were formulated together with the shredding industry, each based on principally different resource recovery strategies: 1) maximising copper re-covery, 2) maximising construction aggregates recovery, and 3) optimising full resource recovery. A streamlined life cycle assessment (LCA) of these valorisation alternatives was performed in relation to the impact categories of climate change, ozone depletion, acidification, and resource depletion. The results of this study generally suggest that in the context of Sweden, Alternatives 1 and 3 are preferable over Alternative 2 regarding all the impact categories. There, Alternative 3 is more preferable regarding climate change, while Alternative 1 is preferable regarding the other impact categories. Several environmental hot spots occur along the different life cycle stages of the fines-derived secondary raw materials. The Monte Carlo simulation of the parameter un-certainties generally confirms the overall LCA findings.

AB  - Fifteen Lophelia reefs from offshore to coastal areas off northern Norway were studied using video. Health status of the coral habitat (degree of physical impact, % cover of living tissue, colony size), occurrence of trawl marks and lost fishing gear, height of coral colonies and associated fauna were analysed from 44 video-lines. Fishing impact was more frequent on the offshore reefs (36.5% of the observed areas) than those in the coastal reefs (0.6%). The most visible effects of fishing were broken and displaced coral colonies. At some sites only small scattered fragments of live corals were observed, indicating recent impact. The mean colony height of Lophelia and gorgonian corals at impacted sites was around half the size of those at non-impacted sites. Both species richness and abundance was higher at nonimpacted coral habitats compared to impacted. The actinarian Protanthea simplex and unidentified brittlestars were the only taxa with higher abundance on impacted compared with non-impacted habitats. The reefs at the offshore location were protected against bottom trawling in 2009 through the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), but a general ban against trawling on known coral reefs had already been implemented in 1999. In the MPA, signs of regrowth were observed. Most of the observed damage probably occurred over 10 years earlier. Results show that live and non-impacted cold water coral reefs have an important ecological function by enhancing the local biodiversity and fish abundance. Preventing further damage to impacted reefs may lead to full recovery within a few decades.

AB  - In an effort to understand processes accompanying aging of forest stands and to support management of commercial forests, population characteristics of epigeic arthropod assemblages (spiders, ground beetles, centipedes, millipedes and woodlice - suborder Oniscidea) were studied in spruce monoculture stands and compared with local environmental factors (litter, coarse and fine woody debris, canopy closure, and moss, herb and shrub cover). Arthropod sampling was conducted in 15 differently aged stands using pitfall traps, with environmental variables monitored concurrently. A total of 66 spider, 29 ground beetle, 12 centipede, 8 millipede and 3 woodlice species were determined. In general, litter depth, herb cover, canopy closure and the amount of coarse woody debris had the greatest influence on assemblage composition in all groups. Spider community composition, being more stenotopic than other arthropod groups, was affected by the highest number of factors. A closer association with site conditions in spiders and ground beetles was manifested by a marked differentiation in the occurrence of forest and open-habitat species in the youngest (open) and oldest (closed) stands, though neither the total species number nor abundance differed significantly throughout stand development. Contrary to arthropod assemblages, significant relationships between ecological groups and environmental variables were identified only in several cases. Centipede diversity (as defined by biodiversity indices) was significantly higher in 30-35-year-old stands.

AB  - Modern agriculture is causing extensive environmental damage. Arguments have been put forward that a systemic change is needed in agriculture to address the major environmental challenges faced by mankind. This is a case study of a research farm whose aim is to form a farming system that has a minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles while maintaining biodiversity. For the farm to minimise its impact on the global carbon cycle and associated climate change, it is important to reduce fossil energy use. The research farm has minimised all its inputs, but uses a diesel-run tractor. Agriculture's primary function is to provide food of adequate quality. The hypothesis of this study is that using biomass from arable land for tractor work on the farm would reduce the amount of food produced relative to using fossil fuel for tractor work. The objective of this paper was to develop scenarios for biomass-derived tractor work for the study farm chosen and to investigate their impact on food production. Food availability was measured by the number of people the farm could supply, denoted as Np. A farm nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) balance was also applied to the different scenarios. The investigated scenarios for replacing fossil fuel tractor work were draught horsepower combined with cold-pressed rape-seed oil in a tractor, ethanol from wheat produced in a conventional ethanol plant, and farm-made ethanol from potatoes. Using wheat and potato to produce ethanol reduced food production by 23% and 18% respectively, compared to using conventional diesel. Combining a draught horse and on-farm cold-pressed rapeseed oil only reduced the food production by 6%. N is maintained in all scenarios due to the nitrogen-fixing leys. P can be maintained in the fields if bones are recycled, but nutrients, especially K, are moved from meadow to field.

AB  - The article examines the new U. S. Arctic strategy adopted by Joseph Biden's administration in October 2022. The new strategy develops the policies of both Barack Obama and Donald Trump. This continuity is particularly relevant to such issues as the promotion of the United States' national interests in the Arctic, strengthening cooperation with NATO allies, increasing the U.S. military presence in the region, promoting the concept of Alaska's sustainable development, developing dialogue and cooperation with the indigenous population of Alaska. However, the document also has a number of significant differences from previous strategies. The Strategy-2022 pays much more attention to the problem of climate change. Under Obama, the development of climate action strategies was still in its initial stage, under Trump it was almost completely ignored, but for the Biden administration it has become a priority again. The Strategy-2022 differs greatly from the Strategy-2013 in its confrontational spirit, and, continuing the traditions of the Trump administration, it sees the Arctic as a region of likely conflicts, not peace and cooperation. Moreover, it has strengthened Trump's policy of confrontation with Russia and China in this region. Washington's military construction plans, the intensification of exercises in the areas adjacent to the Russian Federation, the launch of the process of including Sweden and Finland in NATO creates prerequisites for a smooth inclusion of the Arctic in the NATO area of responsibility. This significantly increases Russia's military vulnerability in the northern and northwestern strategic directions. The Strategy-2022 has a certain inconsistency. On the one hand, the document declares the U.S. commitment to international cooperation in the Arctic. On the other hand, it obviously contains hegemonic aspirations in the region. Washington's position on the resumption of cooperation with Russia in international institutions, including the Arctic Council, remains uncertain. In fact, the Arctic becomes one of new fronts of the long-term competition between the United States and Russia. Such a turn creates concerns not only for Russia, but also for other nations who would like to see the Arctic peaceful, safe and prosperous.

AB  - Scenarios are a useful tool to help think about and visualise the future and, as such, are utilised by many policymakers and practitioners. Future scenarios have not been used to explore the urban context in much depth, yet have the potential to provide valuable insights into the robustness of decisions being made today in the name of sustainability. As part of a major research project entitled Urban Futures, a toolkit has been developed in the UK to facilitate the use of scenarios in any urban context and at any scale relevant to that context. The toolkit comprises two key components, namely, (i) a series of indicators comprising both generic and topic area-specific indicators (e.g., air quality, biodiversity, density, water) that measure sustainability performance and (ii) a list of characteristics (i.e., 1-2-sentence statements about a feature, issue or small set of issues) that describe four future scenarios. In combination, these two components enable us to measure the performance of any given sustainability indicator, and establish the relative sensitivity or vulnerability of that indicator to the different future scenarios. An important aspect of the methodology underpinning the toolkit is that it is flexible enough to incorporate new scenarios, characteristics and indicators, thereby allowing the long-term performance of our urban environments to be considered in the broadest possible sense.

AB  - The Pacific red alga Heterosiphonia japonica has dispersed rapidly along European shores. Due to the species' high abundance in many habitats, an impact on species richness and composition of local macroalgal communities might be expected. Higher sea temperatures may also influence local macroalgal composition, by providing more favourable conditions for species requiring higher temperatures. Macroalgal composition at 22 sublittoral sites along the south-western coast of Norway investigated prior to the establishment of H. japonica (1994-1995) were reinvestigated in 2003-2004, using similar methods. The total number of species collected in the area was approximately the same in the present investigation as in the previous study. With regard to number and composition of species at each site, there were no significant differences between sites with high abundance of H. japonica and sites with low or no abundance. Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) showed that there were temporal changes in composition of the macroalgal communities, mainly caused by higher frequency of 'southern species' (species with a northern limit on our coast). There was a significant increase in the percentage share of such species in the reinvestigations. The temporal differences observed are most likely caused by several warm summers/autumns and mild winters since the first investigation, which may favour a higher abundance of 'southern species'. Heterosiphonia japonica was the most important species contributing to temporal dissimilarity in the area. This paper concludes that H. japonica has caused no negative impact on regional algal species richness in the relatively short time span since its introduction.

AB  - Rice cultivation on paddy soil is commonly associated with emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, but rice varieties may differ in their actual level of emissions. This study analysed methane emissions associated with 22 distinct rice genotypes, using gas chromatography, and identified the cultivar Heijing 5 from northern China as a potential low-methane rice variety. To confirm this and to examine whether Heijing 5 can perform similarly at higher latitudes, Heijing 5 was cultivated in field trials in China (lat. 32 & DEG; N) and Sweden (lat. 59 & DEG; N) where (i) methane emissions were measured, (ii) methanogen abundance in the rhizosphere was determined using quantitative PCR, and (iii) the concentrations of nutrients in water and of heavy metals in rice grain and paddy soil were analysed. The results demonstrated that the low-methane rice cultivar Heijing 5 can successfully complete an entire growth period at high-latitude locations such as central Sweden. Massively parallel sequencing of mRNAs identified candidate genes involved in day length and cold acclimatisation. Cultivation of Heijing 5 in central Sweden was also associated with relatively low heavy metal accumulation in rice grains and lowered nutrient losses to neighbouring water bodies.

AB  - Understanding how the Viking societies were impacted by past climate variability and how they adapted to it has hardly been investigated. Here, we have carried out a new multi-proxy investigation of lake sediments, including geochemical and palynological analyses, to reconstruct past changes in temperature and agricultural practices of pre-Viking and Viking societies in Southeastern Norway during the period between 200 and 1300 CE. The periods 200-300 and 800-1300 CE were warmer than the 300-800 CE period, which is known as the "Dark Ages Cold Period". This cold period was punctuated by century-scale more temperate intervals, which were dominated by the cultivation of cereals and hemp (before 280 CE, 420-480 CE, 580-700 CE, and after 800 CE). In between, cold intervals were dominated by livestock farming. Our results demonstrate that the pre-Viking societies changed their agricultural strategy in response to climate variability during the Late Antiquity. (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In political talk shows, one can sometimes hear that sanctions against Russia are the result of the "Crimean Spring" in 2014 and the Crimea's return to its native Russian harbor, and if this had not happened, the relations between Russia and the West would be extremely good-neighborly, mutually beneficial and friendly... The counterargument runs as follows: the confrontation between Russia and the West has lasted for many centuries. It was in the past, remains nowadays and will continue in the future...The purpose of the article is to analyze the confrontation between Russia and the West at the beginning of the 18th century, which was not only the continuation of the centuries-long confrontation between the parties to the conflict, but also revealed new motives of their rivalry. Earlier, the attack of the Swedish and German knights in the first half of the 13th century, Ivan IV's war against the Swedes, Livonians, Lithuanians and Poles in the second half of the 16th century and the struggle of the Tsardom of Muscovy against the Poles at the beginning of the 17th century took place during the periods of the Russian state's weakness. However, the confrontation between Peter I and united Europe in the Baltic region at the beginning of the 18th century unfolded at the time of Russia's strengthening, when it succeeded in regaining "grandfathers' and fathers'" lands and became a strong state in that geopolitically important region. The study is novel in that it considers this perspective to the problem. The relevance of the study is proved not only by the current state of relations between Russia and the West, in which unprecedented pressure on our country prevails in practically all spheres of the Russian state and society, but also by the fact that the struggle against modern Russia started when it rose from its knees and, overcoming the consequences of the USSR's collapse and the 1990's, declared an independent policy on the international stage. Drawing a parallel between the events taking place in Russian history 300 years ago and nowadays, the West's main and unchanging goal may be determined. This goal is slowing down the development of Russia and limiting its influence on international affairs. The authors conclude that both 300 years ago and now Russia can rely only on itself, its strong economy, powerful armed forces and the unity of the government and the people.

AB  - We studied whether pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and great tit (Parus major) females differed in quality between polluted and unpolluted habitats. Comparing female condition between incubation and nestling periods, we aimed at testing whether biometric differences in F. hypoleuca females were caused by assortative settlement (i.e. intraspecific competition) or as a consequence of breeding in environments exposed to different levels of pollution stress. Body mass, wing length, fat reserves, age distribution, timing of breeding and breeding density of females were measured along an air pollution gradient from a copper smelter in SW Finland in 1991-1994. We found few differences in female quality which could be explained by assortative settling. Females were of the same size in all areas. At nestling time P. major females were heaviest in a moderately polluted area. However, females in the most polluted area were not lighter than those in background areas. Female fat reserves in both species were smaller in the polluted area in one cold breeding season. This suggests that natural (weather) and human induced (pollution) stress factors affected female condition additively. The proportion of young F. hypoleuca females was slightly higher in the polluted area than elsewhere. P. major females started laying earlier near the factory complex than farther away. F. hypoleuca females laid later in the polluted area in early breeding seasons but in late seasons laying started simultaneously everywhere. Especially F. hypoleuca bred more sparsely in the polluted area. Observed differences in the condition of F. hypoleuca females along the pollution gradient emerged mainly in the course of breeding.

AB  - Atmospheric methane concentrations were measured close above the sea surface during surveys in 2011 and 2012 using a Picarro cavity ring-down spectrometer. These surveys covered parts of the UK, Dutch, German, Danish and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. The highest concentrations were recorded in block UK22/4b in a survey area around the site of blowout that occurred in 1990, and which still is known to be actively seeping gas. Variations in the methane concentration recorded during transits between ports and this and other survey areas (Sleipner and Juist) were examined in order to assess whether or not the 22/4b emissions are significant within the general context of the North Sea.
   The provenance of the air mass passing over the ship evidently influences the background methane concentration with additional methane introduced by local (natural and/or anthropogenic) sources; this is made apparent by the large discrepancy between pre- and post-survey measurements made in port. Background variations, estimated by smoothing the raw methane concentrations (taking the hourly average), are significant, and likely reflect both air mass provenance and local contributions. Residual values (the difference between raw and background) reflect deviations from the background, attributable to local sources. 15 residual anomalies were identified; some associated with natural sources, others with petroleum industry sources. Although these comprise lower methane concentrations than those associated with the 22/4b blowout site, they were recorded at transit speed rather than the slower survey speed, or whilst the ship was engaged in seabed operations. The speed and the chance encountering of these anomalies suggest that direct comparisons with the 22/4b methane concentrations are not valid. It is concluded that, whilst the 22/4b emissions are significant, they are not unique. Other methane sources, natural and anthropogenic, are present in the North Sea; the strength of the anomalies suggests that some may be potent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of the study was to outline and demonstrate a new geographic information system (GIS)-based approach for utilising spatial geological data in three dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) to improve estimates on earthworks during early stages of road infrastructure planning.
   Methods This was undertaken by using three main methodological steps: mass balance calculation, life cycle inventory analysis and spatial mapping of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use. The mass balance calculation was undertaken in a GIS environment using two assumptions of geological stratigraphy for two proposed alternative road corridors in Sweden. The estimated volumes of excavated soil, blasted rock and filling material were later multiplied with the GHG emission and energy use factors for these processes, to create spatial data and maps in order to show potential impacts of the studied road corridors. The proposed GIS-based approach was evaluated by comparing with actual values received after one alternative was constructed.
   Results and discussion The results showed that the estimate of filling material was the most accurate (about 9 % deviation from actual values), while the estimate for excavated soil and blasted rock resulted in about 38 and 80 % deviation, respectively, from the actual values. It was also found that the total volume of excavated and ripped soils did not change when accounting for stratigraphy.
   Conclusions The conclusion of this study was that more information regarding embankment height and actual soil thickness would further improve the model, but the proposed GIS-based approach shows promising results for usage in LCA at an early stage of road infrastructure planning. Thus, by providing better data quality, GIS in combination with LCA can enable planning for a more sustainable transport infrastructure.

AB  - Losses of commonly used chemical pesticides from agricultural land may cause serious problems in recipient waters in a similar way to phosphorus (P). Due to analytical challenges concerning determination of glyphosate (Gly), transport behaviour of this widely used herbicide is still not well known. The objective of the present study was to quantify and evaluate leaching of Gly in parallel with P. Leaching losses of autumn-applied Gly (1.06 kg ha(-1)) via drainage water were examined by flow-proportional sampling of discharge from 20 drained plots in a field experiment in eastern Sweden. Samples were analysed for Gly in particulate-bound (PGly) and dissolved (DGly) form. The first 10 mm water discharge contained no detectable Gly, but the following 70 mm had total Gly (TotGly) concentrations of up to 6 mu g L-1, with 62% occurring as PGly. On average, 0.7 g TotGly ha(-1) was leached from conventionally ploughed plots, compared with 1.7 g TotGly ha(-1) from shallow-tilled plots (cultivator to 12 cm working depth). Higher Gly losses occurred in snowmelt periods in spring, but then with the majority (60%) as DGly. All autumn concentrations of PGly in drainage water were significantly correlated (p<0.001) to the concentrations of particulate-bound phosphorus (PP) lost from the different plots (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.84), while PP concentrations were in turn significantly correlated to water turbidity (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.81). Leaching losses of TotGly were significantly lower (by 1.3 g ha(-1); p<0.01) from plots that had been structure-limed three years previously and ploughed thereafter than from shallow-tilled plots. Turbidity and PP concentration also tended to be lowest in discharge from structure-limed plots and highest from shallow-tilled plots. This difference in TotGly leaching between soil management regimes could not be explained by differences in measured pH in drainage water or amount of discharge. However, previously structure-limed plots had significantly better aggregate stability, measured as readily dispersed clay (RDC), than unlimited plots. The effects of building up good soil structure, with strong soil aggregates and an appropriate pore system in the topsoil, on mitigating Gly and P losses in particulate and dissolved form should be further investigated.

AB  - There is a growing demand for ecological restoration using suitable seeds following international standards or national legal demands for local seed-sourcing. However, before selecting the appropriate geographic origin of seeds, it is vital to explore taxonomic complexity related to the focal taxa. We used ddRAD-seq to screen genomic diversity within Carex bigelowii s.lat. focussing on Norway. This species complex is considered a candidate for seeding, but presents considerable morphological, ecological, and genetic variation. The genetic structure of 132 individuals of C. bigelowii s.lat., including Carex nigra as an outgroup, was explored using ordinations, clustering analyses, and a genetic barrier algorithm. Two highly divergent clusters were evident, supporting the recognition of two taxonomic units "C. dacica" and C. bigelowii "subsp. bigelowii". Previously defined seed-sourcing regions for C. bigelowii s.lat. did not consider the known taxonomic complexity, and therefore interpreted the overall genetic structure as seed-sourcing regions, not taxa. We estimated genetic neighborhood sizes within each taxon to be 100-150 km and 300 km, respectively, indicating species-specific delimitations of local seed-sourcing regions. Frequent hybrids, local genetic distinctiveness, and suggested ecotypes add complexity to the discussed seed-sourcing regions. Our results show how genomic screening of diversity and structure in a species complex can alleviate the taxonomic impediment, inform practical questions, and legal requirements related to seed-sourcing, and together with traditional taxonomic work provide necessary information for a sound management of biodiversity.

AB  - High volatile bituminous coal C and B is currently exploited at Spitsbergen-Svalbard, Norway. Several coal seams formed during the Palaeocene, of which some were reworked by mass wasting (MW), (glacial)-fluvial (GF) and coastal-marine wave-dominated (WM) processes under periglacial conditions during the Quaternary. This supergene alteration resulted in different landforms and deposit bearing four different types of depositional environments in Svalbard: (1) Invisible floral and faunal remains, (2) visible floral remains, (3) drift wood, (4) coal placers s. The subaerial slowand fast-moving MW was accompanied by chemical weathering giving rise to jarosite coatings indicative of acidic meteoric solutions, whereas the remaining subaquatic processes operated under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions. Fast-moving MW and WM are productive processes, whereas GF ones are destructive with regard to coal accumulation. The most efficient tools to study the origin of the OM bearing coarse-grained deposits are the morphology and orientation of bioclasts while the LER/HER (= low exothermic / high exothermic reaction) ratio is used for finer-grained OM-bearing sediments. The maceral analysis revealed that the landforms accounted for by GF and WM were emplaced as a result of geogenic and anthropogenic processes and aged younger than 1900 CE, while MW is Quaternary and true geogenic. Driftwood is cast in the role of a marker for coal-bearing (fluvial-) marine environments different in age and rank of coalification. With this in mind it is an excellent tool to drawn the boundary in paralic settings between the marine and fluvial impact. In conclusion, coal fragments are markers for short-term, periodical and fast landform-building processes, whereas siliciclasts from the host and bedrock are markers for long-term and episodical geomorphological and sedimentological supergene alteration.

AB  - Long-term trend of the atmospheric NO2 was analyzed using ambient monitoring data collected from seven major cities in Korea over two decades (1989-2010). In light of the notable environmental policies initiated since June 2000, these NO2 data were also evaluated after dividing the entire study period into period I(1989-1999) and period II (2000-2010). Accordingly, the mean concentrations of NO2 in five out of seven cities in period II were higher by 1-26% than period I. This recognizable increase in period IIIs likely to reflect the effect of increasing consumption rates in primary energy (e.g., petroleum and LNG). An examination of the seasonal trend of NO2 consistently indicates the highest concentrations occurred during winter because of the combined effects of the anthropogenic emission and meteorological conditions. A health risk assessment of our data indicated that the NO2 exposure (to adults, children, and infants) increased from period I to period II. Also, the long-term trends of NO2 were analyzed based on the seasonal Mann Kendall test and the Sen's slopes. It revealed that NO2 levels of most cities had the linearly increasing trends during period I. However, decreasing trends appeared during period II to reflect the direct effect of implementation of administrative efforts including the fuel switching control policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The concentration and transport of faecal pellets (FPs) produced by blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) larvae were estimated in a large, free-flowing river in the north of Sweden during 1997-1999. FPs were abundant from May through August and FP loads in transport peaked at 429 t dry mass d(-1) at a site in the lower part of the river in 1997. Daily transport at the same site, averaged over each study period (16 Jun.-18 Sep. 1997, 6 Apr.-10 Sep. 1998, and 21 Apr.-5 Aug. 1999). was estimated to be 93.7 t dry mass (3.7 t carbon), 47.5 t dry mass (1.9 t carbon and) and 69.2 t dry mass (2.7 t carbon), respectively. On a large scale, there was a downstream trend of increasing FP concentration and, during periods with greater discharge, sedimentation was reduced so that more material was exported from the river. Samples from six sites in a regulated river (into which our focal river flows) parallel to six sites in the unregulated tributary showed considerably lower FP concentrations in the regulated river, presumably because of much smaller blackfly populations as a consequence of habitat loss through damming. A survey of two other large, unregulated rivers in northern Sweden confirmed that these also carry large amounts of FPs. We conclude that the transformation of small suspended food particles into considerably larger FPs by huge populations of filter-feeding blackfly larvae is a major process in large northern rivers.

AB  - Objective: Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy programs have been developed and evaluated in randomized controlled trials during the past two decades to alleviate the rising demand for effective treatment of common mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. While most of the research on internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) has focused on efficacy and effectiveness only little attention has been devoted to the implementation of iCBT. The aim of this study was to identify the main implementation challenges perceived by therapists and managers involved in the practical operation of iCBT services in routine care settings in five European countries.
   Method: The study was designed as a multiple comparative case study to explore differences and similarities between five different iCBT services in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands and Scotland. Field visits were carried out to each of the five services including interviews with the management of the service (n = 9), focus group interviews with key staff (n = 15) and demonstration of online programs. The data material was processed through thematic, comparative analysis.
   Results: The analysis generated four transversal themes: 1) integration in the mental health care system; 2) recruitment of patients; 3) working practice of therapists; and 4) long-term sustainability of service. The main results concerned the need to address the informal integration in the health care systems related to the perceived skepticism towards iCBT from GPs and face-to-face therapists, the role of referral models and communication strategies for the stable recruitment of patients, the need for knowledge, standards and material for the training of therapists in the provision of online feedback, the need to improve the possibilities to tailor programs to individual patients, and the need for considerate long-term sustainability planning of the transitions from local projects to permanent regional or national services.
   Conclusion: The present study gives an overview of the main implementation challenges regarding the practical operation of iCBT services perceived by the therapists and managers of the iCBT services. Future studies into specific details of each challenge will be important to strengthen the evidence base of iCBT and to improve uptake and implementation of iCBT in routine care.

AB  - Non-human animals (hereafter 'animals') populate food production chains in abundance. Discussions about the treatment and welfare of animals usually concern livestock. However, within food production chains many more animals are involved. For the purpose of e.g. food safety, human and animal health, hygiene and safety of stables, large numbers of liminal rodents are killed (with some methods inflicting significant levels of suffering). Whereas the welfare of animals used for food production attracts ever-increasing societal concern, animals perceived as pests are paid scant attention. Considering that rodents have similar capacities to suffer compared to animals used for food production, consistency appears to require that we take their interests into account as well. A stakeholder consultation performed in 2018 by the Centre for Sustainable Animal Stewardship (CenSAS) on the topic of pest management highlighted a shared need to take the moral status and welfare of liminal rodents more seriously. Together with stakeholders, CenSAS is working on the development of an assessment frame for responsible pest management. In order to identify relevant moral concerns and dilemmas, as well as to develop an adequate assessment frame that will support decision-making in practice, the knowledge and experience of pest management professionals is indispensable. That is why we have sent out a survey among these professionals. At the time of writing these words, the results are not available yet. The paper will look into the philosophy behind the survey. At the EurSafe conference in Tampere, Finland, we'll be able to discuss the relevance of our findings, as well as present the first version of our assessment frame for sustainable and responsible pest management.

AB  - Energy Union aims to provide clean, secure, and affordable energy for many customers leading societies towards sustainable energy development. Several criteria were introduced in this vein to evaluate the twenty-third EU countries' progress towards energy union goals. The present study proposed and applied a SWARA-TOPSIS framework based on Pythagorean fuzzy sets to rank the EU members considering their sustainable energy development progress. Ten experts working in various fields were selected to support the identified criteria, and a sensitivity analysis based on twenty scenarios was performed to evaluate the proposed model's sensitivity to weight changes. The obtained results indicated that "energy affordability" is the most influential criterion for evaluating countries, and the proposed model is sensitive to weight changes. Luxembourg is also the first-ranked country, followed by Denmark and Sweden, while Bulgaria achieved the worst rank among the EU considering its progress towards the energy union goals. The analysis of the results indicates room for improvement in implementation with the European Union goals by the EU members and the need to consider energy justice and affordability in the policy development, especially in the new members of the EU.

AB  - Current local or regional flood risk assessments, as required by the EU flood risk directive, rarely account for cascading effects due to interdependencies between critical infrastructures. However, it is essential to consider these effects, as they may severely impact areas outside the immediate flood risk area. The main purpose is to present and problematize a method (AB-CEM) for mapping and analysing cascading effects due to floods, aiming at also being relevant for other spatially widespread hazards. The method development and the pilot study, in Sweden, reveal that there is a prominent practical need for methods for mapping and analysing critical infrastructure interdependencies and cascading effects. Another key finding is that the method process and its results can serve as an important basis for decision-making about proactive and reactive efforts related to geographically extensive hazards. We further conclude that there is a recurring problem regarding sensitive and secret data. More specifically, the conflicting interests of information availability and information security concerning critical infrastructures, which needs to be resolved at the national level and communicated through dear guidelines. The method is a much-needed step towards accounting for cascading effects of floods in practice.

AB  - Introduction: Among the world's regions, the WHO European Region has the lowest rates of exclusive breastfeeding at the age of 6 months with approximately 25%. Low rates and early cessation of breastfeeding have important adverse health consequences for women, infants, and young children. Protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding are a public health priority.
   Objectives: National breastfeeding data and monitoring systems among selected European countries and the WHO European Region are compared. Mechanisms for the support, protection, and promotion of breastfeeding are reviewed and successes and challenges in implementation of national programs are presented.
   Methods: National representatives of national breastfeeding committees and initiatives in 11 European countries, including Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, participated in a standardized survey.
   Results are evaluated and compared in a narrative review. Results: Variation exists in Europe on breastfeeding rates; methodology for data collection; and mechanisms for support, protection, and promotion of breastfeeding. Directly after birth, between 56% and 98% of infants in all countries were reported to receive any human milk, and at 6 months 38% to 71% and 13% to 39% of infants to be breastfed or exclusively breastfed, respectively. National plans addressing breastfeeding promotion, protection, and support exist in 6 of the 11 countries.
   Conclusions: National governments should commit to evidence-based breastfeeding monitoring and promotion activities, including financial and political support, to improve breastfeeding rates in the Europe. Renewed efforts for collaboration between countries in Europe, including a sustainable platform for information exchange, are needed.

AB  - After the Germanwings accident, the French Safety Investigation Authority (BEA) recommended that the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Community (EC) develop clear rules for the duty of notification process. Aeromedical practitioners (AMEs) face a dilemma when considering the duty of notification and conflicts between pilot privacy and public and third-party safety. When balancing accountability, knowledge of the duty of notification process, legislation and the clarification of a doctor's own set of values should be assessed a priori. Relatively little is known of the magnitude of this problem in aviation safety. To address this, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database was searched to identify fatal accidents during 2015 in the United States in which a deceased pilot used a prescribed medication or had a disease that potentially reduced pilot performance and was not reported to the AME. Altogether, 202 finalized accident reports with toxicology were available from (the year) 2015. In 5% (10/202) of these reports, the pilot had either a medication or a disease not reported to an AME which according to the accident investigation was causal to the fatal accident. In addition, the various approaches to duty of notification in aviation in New Zealand, Finland and Norway are discussed. The process of notification of authorities without a pilot's express permission needs to be carried out by using a guidance protocol that works within legislation and professional responsibilities to address the pilot and the public, as well as the healthcare provider. Professional guidance defining this duty of notification is urgently needed.

AB  - IntroductionRefugees face the process of cross-cultural transitions upon arrival in their host country. This process is commonly referred to as acculturation and can be particularly challenging for asylum-seeking children and adolescent unaccompanied by a caregiver. To more effectively facilitate unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) resettlement, this study sought to obtain an enhanced understanding of the acculturation processes of these youth'. MethodsThus, interviews with 48 URMs, all of whom arrived before the age of 16 years, were analyzed in two steps. First, how the youth described their host country's society and culture, followed by how they navigated within this societal and cultural landscape during resettlement. ResultsThe youth described how they navigated the Norwegian cultural and societal landscape by gaining cultural competence, adapting and finding ways to contribute, which made it easier for the youth to gain access to the society, to succeed as well as enhance their sense of agency. However, the youths also reported having to navigate between the expectations of their original and host country cultures, struggling with finding a balance between the two cultures. DiscussionThe youth' acculturation processes seemed to be the result of both their own needs, wishes and behavior as well as specific features in their host country culture, which supports the notion that acculturation processes to some degree are context- and culture-dependent. Knowledge regarding the cultural and societal framework that these youth face and how they navigate within it during resettlement is critical for identifying possible cross-cultural challenges and promoting positive developmental tracks. To understand more about acculturation and integration processes, future research should include specific cultural and societal features as well as immigrants' own perspectives and experiences during resettlement.

AB  - Wetlands are rich in biodiversity, but globally threatened. After a long period of regional extirpation, beavers have recently returned to many European areas and are now restoring wetlands. The beaver is remarkable regarding the large impacts it has not only on individual species but on entire communities and ecosystems. In fact, beavers are referred to as ecosystem engineers'.The facilitative effect of the beaver Castor canadensis on a waterbird community of seven species of waders and ducks in boreal ponds was studied by using the before-after control-impact method (BACI) and analysing the effect of the duration of flooding. The before-after setting could be used since beavers had caused disturbance by flooding several forest ponds during the course of this long-term study (1988-2009). The study took place in southern Finland, where waterbirds were surveyed four times during the breeding season.The number of waterbird species per pond per year was significantly higher during beaver inundation than before beaver activity, as was the waterbird abundance per survey. Changes were negligible in the controls. The numbers of all seven species increased during flooding, although the increase was significant in only three species. Common teal Anas crecca and green sandpiper Tringa ochropus showed the most positive numerical response to flooding. Mallard Anas platyrhynchos and wigeon Anas penelope were new species entering the duck guild in the flooded wetlands. The beneficial effect of the flood lasted the whole period of inundation, although the most substantial increase in species number appeared during the first two years of flooding.The beaver acted as a whole-community facilitator for waterbirds. It was inferred from previous studies that this was done by modifying the habitat to make it more productive and structurally favourable. It is concluded that favouring beavers is a worthwhile tool in restoring wetlands to promote waterbird communities. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Forest management and climate change, directly or indirectly, affect drinking water resources, both in terms of quality and quantity. In this study in the Northern Limestone Alps in Austria we have chosen model calculations (LandscapeDNDC) in order to resolve the complex long-term interactions of management and climate change and their effect on nitrogen dynamics, and the consequences for nitrate leaching from forest soils into the karst groundwater. Our study highlights the dominant role of forest management in controlling nitrate leaching. Both clear-cut and shelterwood-cut disrupt the nitrogen cycle to an extent that causes peak concentrations and high fluxes into the seepage water. While this effect is well known, our modelling approach has revealed additional positive as well as negative impacts of the expected climatic changes on nitrate leaching. First, we show that peak nitrate concentrations during post-cutting periods were elevated under all climate scenarios. The maximal effects of climatic changes on nitrate concentration peaks were 20-24 mg L-1 in 2090 with shelterwood or clear-cut management. Second, climate change significantly decreased the cumulative nitrate losses over full forest rotation periods (by 10-20%). The stronger the expected temperature increase and precipitation decrease (in summer), the lesser were the observed nitrate losses. However, mean annual seepage water nitrate concentrations and cumulative nitrate leaching were higher under continuous forest cover management than with shelterwood-cut and clear-cut systems. Watershed management can thus be adapted to climate change by either reducing peak concentrations or long-term loads of nitrate in the karst groundwater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - CONTEXT: Transitions to more sustainable livestock production systems are increasingly demanded by parts of society. Scientists suggest moving towards diversified farming systems due to their potential environmental and economic benefits, especially in the organic sector. However, empirical knowledge of multi-species livestock farms, i.e. farms keeping two or more animal species, is lacking.OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to identify European organic multi-species livestock farms that outperform their peers despite having the same resources and constraints, and characterize their distinctive management principles.METHODS: We conducted surveys on 102 farms in seven European countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Ger-many, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. We restricted the analysis to a sub-sample of 75 farms that had complete data and that covered 3 main livestock combinations (cattle and sheep, cattle and pigs, cattle and poultry) with similar number of farms. We implemented a positive deviant approach based on three indicators: land pro-ductivity, nitrogen input dependence and satisfaction regarding income.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Five structurally diverse positive deviant farms were identified with 4 types of livestock combinations represented, and farmland area ranging from 25 to 273 ha, herd size from 33 to 146 livestock units (LU) and total workforce size from 1 to 24 annual worker units (AWU). These farms were located on a trade-off between land productivity and autonomy for feed, and all but one had high overall autonomy for feed (89-100% against a mean of 76% for the whole sample). Their diversity of pastures, crops and livestock species and their diversification beyond agricultural production were controlled (e.g. no agritourism) and below that of the other sample farms, to remain manageable by the farmers while still allowing to buffer shocks and hazards. Interactions among farm enterprises remained limited to matter (mainly grain, straw, hay, manure) flows, and practices requiring specific efforts and investments (e.g. for fencing), such as co-grazing of different livestock and crop residues grazing, were avoided.SIGNIFICANCE: We conducted the first integrated study on European organic multi-species livestock farms and identified key management principles implemented on positive deviant farms. We showed that whatever their size, farms outperforming their peers do not necessarily maximize diversity of agricultural productions and of non-agricultural activities, and interactions among farm enterprises but that they remain at a level of complexity manageable by the farmers. These principles will inform farmers running multi-species livestock farms or transitioning to this model.

AB  - The substantial increase of deer populations in Europe and North America in recent decades has led to concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of current management from an ecosystem perspective. Key questions to be answered are how herbivore density relates to available resource levels, e.g. food availability and browsing pressure, and how this relation should be monitored and included in management. In Norway, the harvest of red deer Cervus elaphus has increased from 1,479 to 35,700 during 1960-2008. Current monitoring programmes focus on deer body mass and number of seen deer rather than on the state of the vegetation communities. In our study, we quantify browsing frequency on common shrubs and trees in two municipalities, Gloppen and Flora, in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, Norway, to document current browsing pressure levels and to evaluate the potential of using browsing frequency of indicator species as a tool in the monitoring of red deer populations. We found that several species were heavily browsed (median browsing frequency > 60%). Due to their wide availability, we analysed the spatial patterns of accumulated browsing of the highly selected rowan Sorbus aucuparia compared to the less selected bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and birch Betula sp. We predicted less spatial variation in browsing frequency of the highly selected rowan. However, we found that the best model predicting browsing on rowan (forest type, habitat productivity, canopy cover, aspect, slope and distance to arable land) based on habitat variables was more complicated than for birch (habitat productivity and altitude) and bilberry (forest type, habitat productivity, altitude and distance from the coast). This suggests large spatial variation in browsing frequency of rowan even though the average browsing frequency of rowan was higher than for bilberry and birch. Browsing frequency for all species was positively correlated with faeces counts, but only bilberry showed additional correlation with red deer (harvest) density at the local management unit scale. Due to its wide distribution and promising link to local red deer density, bilberry stands out as the most promising species to monitor among winter browse species. However, browsing frequency on different species was not always correlated. It remains to be determined to which extent browsing on bilberry can be used as an indicator for the browsing pressure on the whole vegetation community. The documentation of high browsing frequencies clearly suggests that further focus on these issues is warranted.

AB  - People around the world pay increasingly more attention to health, social, environmental, and ethical issues. As a consequence, they seek value in food that is fresh, less processed, and sustainably sourced. The article presents an experimental project supporting the implementation of a circular food system in the city of Turku, Finland. The outcome of the project is a globally replicable concept of managing a local circular food system in sustainable urban farming. The project had two objectives: (1) to reduce food waste in restaurants in the Turku University Campus; (2) to support local recycling of nutrients by composting food waste generated in the pilot restaurant and reuse the nutrients in the process of urban farming. The presented concept is based on the results of two experimental studies. It ties in with UN and EU sustainable development strategies and policies, e.g., Sustainable Development Goals (2, 11, and 12), the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy, and the concepts of Circular Economy and Sustainable Cities.

AB  - The term bioeconomy has been generated as a new discourse in the environmental policy arena. This paper raises three questions: (i) are environmental concerns integrated in the political discourses of bioeconomy and, if so, to what extent?, (ii) in which way is the environment framed in the political discourses of bioeconomy?, and (iii) are environmental concerns considered in the political discourses on forest-based bioeconomy? The theoretical framework of this paper builds on the cognitive approach of policy integration and on frame analysis. The empirical research design is a comparative qualitative analysis of five different political bioeconomy discourses in the EU and four different EU member states - Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands - in general and in the forestry sector specifically. Results show a weak and mainly rhetorical integration of environmental concerns in political bioeconomy discourses. Three major environmental frames are identified: (i) The dominant frame of 'Environment benefitting from economic growth', (ii) the 'Environment as a challenge' and (iii) the less visible 'Environment as a standard' frame. In general, these frames address the environment mainly as a challenge or something that needs to be safeguarded with the help of the bioeconomy. With the exception of Finland, amongst the countries studied, forests plays only a minor role in bioeconomy discourses while environmental concerns in this strand of discussion are mainly focused on sustainability arguments in general.

AB  - Breeding success and adult survival of Redshank Tringa totanus on coastal meadows on Gotland, SE Sweden, was investigated in 1997-2003. Two periods with different breeding success could be detected. In 1997-1999, nest success varied between 43 and 64%. Chick survival was not studied in these years. In 2000-03, nest success was lower and varied between 6 and 20%. Survival of chicks from hatching to fledging was estimated at 18%. Hence, overall productivity in 2000-03 was low and estimated to be only 0.13 fledglings per breeding pair. Nest survival rates were negatively related to incubation initiation date but fledging success was not related to hatching date. Adult survival rate was analysed from capture-resighting data of 164 adult Redshanks and was estimated at 80%. Adult survival did not differ significantly between sexes or between years. The results from this study suggest that reproductive success was lower than needed for a self-sustainable population, at least in the latter period with particularly low nest survival rates. There was no apparent change in management of meadows during the study period. Therefore, the decrease in nest survival rates was more likely to be an effect of changes in predator densities and/or behaviours. Further studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms behind demographic processes in wader populations on coastal meadows.

AB  - The paper examines the reproduction of Estonian provinces within governmental practices when re-establishing the nation-state in the years 1989-2002. The theory of regional institutionalization, introduced by the Finnish geographer Anssi Paasi, is modified as the analytical framework of the study. The qualitative analysis of interview transcripts, legislative acts, official documents and media texts demonstrates the unequal reproduction of provinces on four analytical dimensions - territorial, symbolic, institutional and regional system. The territorial changes and institutional modifications that occurred during the transition period, when the Estonian provinces were symbolically re-established, were less drastic than those that occurred under the Soviet administration but have nevertheless weakened the provinces as an effective layer of government. The study also shows that the postponed administrative reform in 1997-2002 had a dual nature that led to contradictory outcomes. One outcome was that the postponed reform, as a normative representational practice aimed at making substantial changes in the administrative system, had a predominantly negative and de-productive effect on the provincial reality in Estonia. The other outcome was that the postponed reform, as a practice relying on the extant institutional, physical and cultural realities of the provinces, tended to contribute positively to the reproduction of the provinces. However, the analysis reveals that neither tendency was uniform, the variations depending on the character of provinces and institutional actors.

AB  - Purpose In smart cities pervasive systems are deployed by enterprises and stakeholders in municipalities to provide digital services to citizens. But cities are faced with the challenge of achieving system pluggability, mainly service integration due to numerous actors and systems needed for smart urban transformation. Hence, there is need to employ a comprehensive and holistic approach to help achieve service integration of pervasive platforms. Therefore, this study presents an Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to support smart urban transformation. Design/methodology/approach In this study the design science research methodology is adopted based on a multi-case studies of two organizations and data is collected using semi-structured interview from an organizations and municipality in Norway to validate how service integration can be achieved by the developed EAF to address pluggability challenges faced in urban environment. Findings Findings suggest that the presented EAF provides the structure to manage changes and maintain urban transformation and aims to align the business with the underlying information systems from the perspective of the stakeholders. Additionally, findings from the case studies modelled in ArchiMate language depict how service integration of different pervasive platforms provide digital services for smart urban transformation. Research limitations/implications This research only employed semi-structured interviews to validate service integration of digital platforms, other identified dimensions of pluggability were not fully addressed in this study. Practical implications Findings from the case studies provides insights on how pervasive platforms can be integrated to achieve a pluggable digital service from different stakeholders and data sources in practice. The developed EAF presented in this study provide a model that supports collection and exchange of data from different data sources in smart urban environment to enable the provision and consumption of digital services. Social implications The developed EAF aids system pluggability of actors and systems in providing digital service such as smart urban transformation that contributes to sustainable use of electric mobility in cities. Originality/value As cities increasingly deploy pervasive platforms to support urban innovation, researchers are seeking to explore how these platforms shape urban transformation. Presently, prior studies do not offer important insights into pervasive platform management from urban perspective. Against this backdrop, this study employs the information systems perspective of digital platforms literature roots in software development and physical product development to depict how the EAF can be employed to describe specific cases that integrate different pervasive platforms deployed by different stakeholders communicating to co-create collective digital services to citizens.

AB  - To evaluate compost quality, along with traditional agrochemical parameters it is advisable to apply an all-encompassing analysis of compost activity by many biological parameters. The analysis covers the following indices: enzymatic activity, ability to inhibit phytopathogenic microflora, and composition of the microbial cenosis. An all-encompassing method was applied to a comparative study of composts produced from municipal wastes from Sweden, the Czech Republic and from pig farm wastes of the Netherlands. The recommended method will make it possible to expand the spectrum of biocompost application and optimize the technology of its application in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Fundamental knowledge on the determinants of air temperatures across spatial and temporal scales is essential in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Spatial-based statistical modelling provides an efficient approach for the analysis and prediction of air temperatures in human-modified environments at high spatial accuracy. The aim of the study was firstly, to analyse the environmental factors affecting extreme air temperature conditions in a coastal high-latitude city and secondly, to explore the applicability of generalized additive model (GAM) in the study of urban-rural temperatures. We utilized air temperature data from 50 permanent temperature logger stations and extensive geospatial environmental data on different scales from Turku, SW Finland. We selected five temperature situations (cases) and altogether 12 urban and natural explanatory variables for the analyses. The results displayed that (i) water bodies and topographical conditions were often more important than urban variables in controlling the spatial variability of extreme air temperatures, (ii) case specificity of the explanatory variables and their scales should be considered in the analyses and (iii) GAM was highly suitable in quantifying and visualizing the relations between urban-rural temperatures and environmental determinants at local scales. The results promote the use of GAMs in spatial-based statistical modelling of air temperature in future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the factors that intensify the invasion patterns across the geographic ranges is an important challenge in the effort to conserve biodiversity. in the present study we tried to establish a correlation between the exotic invasive richness with different habitat types. to achieve the goal we used importance value index for biodiversity assessment and established linear regression along with spearman's rank correlation to testify the significant relationship between chosen habitat types and dependent variables, including exotic species richness and cover. invasive cover from all three habitats was positively correlated with the invasive species number but negatively correlated with the total species richness and the native richness. invasive species richness, however, was neither correlated with native richness nor the total species richness. in riparian areas a significant positive correlation was observed between invasive species richness and areas away from direct water sources than areas near water sources. our results highlight that riparian areas despite having high native richness are more prone to plant invasion than forest periphery and highway roadsides. however, areas with increased feral cattle activity along with scattered cattle dung from all three habitats were also found promoting plant invasions. our result from riparian areas thus rebuff the widespread hypothesis (rich biodiversity less invasion) proposing that migration and establishment of invasive species are likely to be based primarily on changes in propagule pressure, availability of nutrients and light and not exclusively on habitat richness.

AB  - Unsustainable fishing can be surprisingly persistent despite devastating social, economic, and ecological consequences. Sustainability science literature suggests that the persistence of unsustainable fisheries can be understood as a social-ecological trap. Few studies have explicitly acknowledged the role of historical legacies for the development of social-ecological traps. Here, we investigate why fishers sometimes end up in social-ecological traps through a reconstruction of the historical interplay between fishers' motivations, capacities, and opportunities to fish. We focus on the case of a Swedish fishery targeting the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla Anguilla) in the Baltic Sea. We performed the case study using a unique quantitative data set of social and ecological variables that spans over eight decades, in combination with earlier literature and interviews with fishers and fisheries experts. Our analysis reveals that Swedish archipelago fishers are highly dependent on the eel to maintain their fishing livelihood. The dependence on the eel originates from the 1930s, when fishers chose to intensify fishing for this species to ensure future incomes. The dependence persisted over time because of a series of changes, including improved eel fishing technology, heightened competition over catch, reduced opportunities to target other species, implementation of an eel fishing license, and the fishers' capacity and motivation to deal with dwindling catches. Our study confirms that social-ecological traps are path-dependent processes. In terms of management, this finding means that it becomes progressively more difficult to escape the social-ecological trap with the passage of time. The longer entrapment endures, the more effort it takes and the bigger change it requires to return to a situation where fishers have more options so that unsustainable practices can be avoided. We conclude that fisheries policies need to be based on the premise that unsustainable fishing emerges through multiple rather than single causes.

AB  - The paper explores the role of natural resource accounting and calculations as tools for inducing movement towards ecologically sound policy making. We draw from the theoretical debates in social studies of science and technology (STS) to understand how calculations gain their power in real-world decision-making. Through in-depth case analysis of a local energy production decision in Finland, we study how and under what conditions calculative methods related to environmental valuation affect the rationalities applied in policy decisions. On the basis of our analysis, we claim that new calculative rationalities do not become significant through changing ways of thinking alone. There is a need for shift of calculative framing. This shift requires active promotion by powerful actors and furthermore, new framings need to become embedded in the rules of the game of decision making. Our analysis suggests that the methods of STS can provide a valuable tool for economists' creation of richer understanding of the dynamics between calculative rationalities and the institutions of decision-making. In-depth case analysis of decision making involving the use of natural resources brings out the multitude of ways in which calculations can take part in or be excluded from the making of natural resource policy.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of coniferous forest cover in the catchment basin and relative catchment area (catchment area to lake volume ratio) on phytoplankton composition in humic lakes. The study was carried out in 11 small and shallow lakes situated in the West Polesie region (Eastern Poland). The lakes were divided with respect to forest cover in their catchment basins into two groups: high forest cover - HFC (more than 60%) and low forest cover - LFC (less than 60%). The study showed that both, land use in the catchments (proportion of forests) and the relative catchment area determined physicochemical and biological parameters in the lakes. The high relative catchment area affects their high productivity expressed by high chlorophyll a concentration and low water visibility. The lakes of the LFC group had low water colour as well as high concentration of total phosphorus (P-tot), reaction (pH), and conductivity of water and a large number of cyanophytes and chlorophytes. The dominant species, e.g., Planktolyngbya limnetica, Limnothrix planctonica, Planktothrix agardhii, Coenococcus planctonicus, were characteristic of high trophic status. In the lakes of the HFC group, P-tot, pH, conductivity of water and the contribution of cyanophytes and chlorophytes was considerably lower, whereas the water colour and the number of raphidophytes represented by Gonyostomum semen was high. The large number of raphidophytes and the small amount of chlorophytes and cyanophytes in the lakes of the HFC group indicated the lake naturalness.

AB  - The use of ICTs in the public sector, eGovemance, is understood as a complex phenomenon intricately embedded in a continuously changing environment, including multiple actors with disparate interests. A need for research that takes this complexity into account has been identified, and previous research has suggested employing a sustainability perspective. The use of the sustainability concept in the eGovernance context is an emerging area without a common focus or use of the concept. There is a lack of research with a thorough basis in sustainability theory, and a need for empirical research focusing on sustainable eGovemance. In order to respond to this need the research question of this paper is, How can current eGovernance practice be interpreted from a sustainability perspective? A case study is performed in the context of Swedish eGovemance practice, at national and municipal level. Interviews are used to investigate practitioners' views, which are analyzed by using a framework, developed based on eGovemance literature that highlights sustainability. We find that sustainability in eGovernance practice in this case revolve to a large extent around how actors struggle with achieving continuity and implementing a holistic view of the use of ICT in the public sector. We also highlight the issue of trade-offs between different sustainability dimensions. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Narratives of cellular agriculture, or food technologies using cell cultivation to produce agricultural products such as cultured meat, promise sustainable, ethical alternatives as well as solutions to global food challenges. Although cultured meat is unavailable to consumers, people have formed opinions about it on the basis of media coverage. Drawing on studies of the meaning system of food and the media publicity surrounding cultured meat, the aim is to analyze the emerging meanings of cultured meat in Finnish online news comments (n = 662). The comments were examined using qualitative content analysis and the results were utilized to construct an emerging meaning system for cultured meat. The results indicate that this system draws from nine themes and three aggregate categories, based on the following questions: Why is cultured meat necessary (environmental, animal wellbeing and healthiness considerations)? What are the anticipated product characteristics (naturalness, potential risks and sensory qualities)? How is cultured meat expected to influence societies (the role of actors, decision-making and inequities caused by cultured meat)? The uncertainties of these issues have led to conflicting interpretations, which prevent the achievement of a shared definition of cultured meat and complicate the establishment of cultured meat as an accepted food.

LA  - English
AB  - The research program Sustainable Coastal Zone Management (SUCOZOMA), which was started in 1996 by the Swedish Foundation of Strategic Environmental Research, was motivated by the recognition of increasingly severe global, regional and national coastal problems. The program approached the complex issues of coastal eutrophication, fishing practices, and overexploited coastal resources, with a concerted effort involving multidisciplinarity, stakeholder cooperation, and a focus on the problems perceived as most serious by the public and decision-makers. As the program was concluded in 2004 it had resulted in the completion or near-completion of 22 doctoral dissertations and approximately one hundred publications, More than 40 scientists were involved in the program. Goteborg University was the host university, but important research teams have also been located at Stockholm University, the Beijer Institute, and the Kristineberg Marine Research Station of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and within the National Board of Fisheries. During the program, networks of stakeholders were established and SUCOZOMA had contributed to numerous political and administrative processes relevant for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). SUCOZOMA program results can be grouped into different categories. Many of the projects in the two phases of the program produced results which can be defined as technical or practical and available for direct implementation in, e.g. mussel cultivation, restoration and safeguarding of spawning areas, seal-safe fishing gear or sustainable fishing of underexploited species. Other results can be characterized as policy oriented, and the impact of these can only be fairly evaluated as new policies are put into effect. SUCOZOMA resulted in important new knowledge regarding coastal science and management, but also concerning the organization required to conduct an end-user oriented multidisciplinary program effectively.

Within the last decade, many organizations have heavily invested on Knowledge Management (KM) efforts in order to enhance learning. Several approaches have emerged ranging from highly sophisticated knowledge repositories building to experience or knowledge based systems. The article explores the new area of using narrative games and role-play in order to cultivate the learning organization emergence. We are engaged in the Knowln project in the Municipality of Amot, Norway, where we will introduce role play as a way of sharing and creating knowledge amongst middle management in the administrative sector.

AB  - For the transport sector to become more sustainable, substantial technological and behavioural changes are required. Increased understanding about household choices related to more green alternatives in transportation is needed in order for policy makers to make efficient policies in the future. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze which factors that determines the fuel choice between ethanol and gasoline for owners of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs). We evaluate how the self-reported fuel choice is influenced by the relative price, as well as individual differences in norms and perceptions about environmental and quality attributes of ethanol. Data was collected through a survey sent to Swedish FFV owners and is analyzed in a binary choice and a LCM framework. Results show that price, perceptions about quality, age and environmental attitudes influence the self-reported willingness to choose ethanol. Furthermore, results show that preferences are not homogenous, three groups are identified; price conscious respondents, ethanol skeptical respondents and respondents with pronounced environmental concern. However, although the motive for introducing and subsidizing ethanol was to reduce climate and environmental impacts, the group that chooses ethanol based on climate and environmental motives is small. The results further reveal that the debate about motor damages from ethanol have had a long lasting effect on the willingness to choose ethanol. Thus, it is necessary to try to prevent or mitigate concerns regarding e.g. potential technical or ethical issues when promoting future technologies or fuels aimed at a sustainable transportation sector.

AB  - Efficient and timely maintenance is essential for the robust operation of infrastructure across all types of transport. In the railway sector, track maintenance presents unique challenges. Specifically, some maintenance tasks require track closures, which can disrupt train schedules. Coordinating these closures with regular train operations makes the scheduling process complicated. To ensure sufficient time for maintenance and prevent conflicts with train operations, the Swedish Transport Administration introduced "maintenance windows." Maintenance windows, ranging from two to six hours, are periods designated for maintenance, with the track free from train operations. They are set before finalizing the annual train timetable. In this study, we examined the practical application of maintenance windows on a railway line in Southern Sweden from 2019 to 2020. Our findings reveal that while 10% of the total line capacity was allocated for maintenance windows, 11% of the capacity was used for maintenance. Alarmingly, 68% of trackwork occurred outside maintenance windows, and only 34% of the reserved maintenance window capacity was utilized. There is a significant discrepancy between the time and location reserved for maintenance windows and their actual utilization. To address this, we propose aligning maintenance windows more closely with contractor needs by 1) incorporating maintenance windows on the weekends, 2) making maintenance windows available closer to the end of the planning horizon, 3) extending the duration of some maintenance windows, and 4) designing and integrating incentives to encourage contractors to operate within planned maintenance windows.

AB  - The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic-in terms of climate, economy and social aspects-cannot yet be fully assessed, but we can already see how the pandemic is intensifying already existing socio-economic inequalities. This applies to different population groups, particularly the elderly. In this article, our goal is to identify the linguistic constructions of elderly citizens in Swedish mass media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 from a sociological and corpus linguistics perspective. More specifically, our aim is to explore the discursive formations of the elderly in Swedish media during the pandemic and how these formations relate to risk as well as the discursive constructions of in- and out-groups. Drawing on corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS), inspired by discourse-historical analysis (DHA), we examine the media coverage of COVID-19 by three Swedish newspapers published during 2020: Aftonbladet, a national tabloid; Svenska Dagbladet, a national morning newspaper; and Dalademokraten, a regional morning newspaper. In this article, the news articles and their messages are considered performative to the extent that-for example, at the same time as a story is expressed-the elderly are at risk of becoming seriously ill due to COVID-19; moreover, a position of vulnerability for the elderly is simultaneously created. The result reveals that the elderly were constructed as an at-risk group, while visitors, personnel and nursing homes were constructed as being risky or a threat to the elderly.

AB  - Global investment in offshore wind energy is anticipated to surge in the coming decades. While improved technology, reduced costs, and generous policy support are frequently acknowledged as driving factors, many assert that there are fewer societal challenges with offshore renewable installations than with onshore ones. Drawing from a co-creation process with key Norwegian stakeholders and an interdisciplinary team of social science and humanities scholars, this article delves deeper than the prevalent techno-economic discourse. It seeks to: a) identify the societal challenges of fostering a just and legitimate offshore wind industry; b) explore solutions to these challenges; and c) understand the potential role of transdisciplinary action research in driving change. Through this collaboration, industry actors co-formulated an agenda for offshore wind, highlighting varied issues and concerns. This was operationalized into four primary societal challenges: 1) Navigating the public debate; 2) Improving public participation; 3) Minimizing land and sea use and co-existence conflicts, and 4) Understanding pace, political dynamics, and geopolitics. This paper offers an exhaustive discussion on possible strategies to tackle these issues, presenting a critical companion research agenda to the predominantly technology-focused studies on offshore wind within the sustainability transitions literature.

AB  - Between 1850 and 1970, rivers throughout Sweden were channelized to facilitate timber floating. Floatway structures were installed to streamline banks and disconnect flow to secondary channels, resulting in simplified channel morphologies and more homogenous flow regimes. In recent years, local authorities have begun to restore channelized rivers. In this study, we examined the effects of restoration on riparian plant communities at previously disconnected secondary channels of the Pite River. We detected no increase in riparian diversity at restored sites relative to unrestored (i.e., disconnected) sites, but we did observe significant differences in species composition of both vascular plant and bryophyte communities. Disconnected sites featured greater zonation, with mesic-hydric floodplain species represented in plots closest to the stream and mesic-xeric upland species represented in plots farthest from the stream. In contrast, restored sites were most strongly represented by upland species at all distances relative to the stream. These patterns likely result from the increased water levels in reconnected channels where, prior to restoration, upland plants had expanded toward the stream. Nonetheless, the restored fluvial regime has not brought about the development of characteristic flood-adapted plant communities, probably due to the short time interval (ca. 5 years) since restoration. Previous studies have demonstrated relatively quick responses to similar restoration in single-channel tributaries, but secondary channels may respond differently due to the more buffered hydrologic regimes typically seen in anabranching systems. These findings illustrate how restoration outcomes can vary according to hydrologic, climatic and ecological factors, reinforcing the need for site-specific restoration strategies.

AB  - Background: Since 1977, osseointegrated implants have played a strong role in oral rehabilitation. Despite the large success of this technique for the edentulous maxilla and mandible with sufficient bone height, patients with atrophic jaws continue to be the challenging cases for an adequate reconstruction of aesthetics and functionality. Orthognathic surgical procedures have been developed to reposition the jaws and have been traditionally used in the dentate patient to correct a skeletal malocclusion; these procedures can be used on the edentulous patient to correct the discrepancies between the jaws followed by the placement of implants to rehabilitate the oral cavity. Recently, surgeons can use a computer-assisted software package that enables them to insert implants after a digital analysis of the residual alveolar and basal bone that makes for greater implant osseointegration. We describe a one-step oral rehabilitation with Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement to correct a posttraumatic deformity.
   Clinical Report: The first step of the definitive treatment, the implant placement, was planned with the aid of a computer-assisted surgery software package (NobelGuide; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden). Ten computer-planned implants (Nobel Biocare AB) were inserted (6 on the maxillary arch and 2 on each posterior area of the mandible). Simultaneously, the patient underwent a Le Fort I osteotomy to correct the maxillary deficiency without any bone grafts.
   Discussion: The use of Le Fort I osteotomy as a preprosthetic procedure for the atrophic edentulous maxilla has been well accepted. This is a technically demanding procedure, and there are some described complications such as unfavorable fractures of the maxilla, oroantral fistulas, bone exposure, and low implant survival rates. However, in selected cases, this reconstructive method has the advantages over the other commonly used preprosthetic techniques of simultaneously allowing the placement of osseointegrated implants while correcting an unfavorable intermaxillary relationship and improving facial aesthetics. Computer-assisted surgery offers to the surgeons the possibility to visualize anatomic structures, evaluate implant position and inclination, insert accurately implants, prefabricate prosthesis, and avoid the morbidity of bone grafting procedures.
   Conclusions: One-step oral rehabilitation by Le Fort I and computer-guided implant placement can be used in selected patients. Despite the difficulty of this procedure, this approach enabled the authors to solve simultaneously a double problem: the malocclusion and the partially atrophic and edentulous jaws. According to the literature, this is the first case of a simultaneous Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement. The patient introduced had a posttraumatic deformity, but we think that this procedure could be extended in the future to manage other situations.

AB  - Although most discussions on building stocks assume a static or growing stock over time, this case study highlights the opposite condition of a shrinking population and its potential effects on the building stock. Scenarios to 2050 are presented for the housing stock in eastern and western Germany based on population projections. Due to long-term population decline, the prospect of increasing housing vacancies raises new questions for urban housing stock management, operation and maintenance strategies. In the first years of the new millennium, the demolition rate in eastern Germany increased to 0.5% of the existing stock per year. This rate may need to increase further over the next 40 years to keep the vacancy rate below an average of 15%, which could mean 20-25% in multiple-dwelling units. With 25 years' delay, western Germany will enter a similar development stream also due to population shrinkage. Spatial disparities of shrinking population patterns will require a critical revision of public policy. Reconciling environmental objectives to preserve old stocks, reduce demolition rates, and reduce material flows will need to be balanced with demographic, social and economic concerns. This will impact on the current interpretations of sustainable development and suggests that regional circumstances will need to be incorporated into the evolving definition.

AB  - AimThe Anthropocene is characterised by urban and agricultural landscapes. Within these landscapes, natural to semi-natural habitats are fragmented, isolated and disturbed to varying degrees. Species associated with these natural habitats have to content with the surrounding landscape, both in terms of level of isolation, and matrix type and quality. We investigated the community structure, trait distribution and individual traits of carabid beetles in boreal forest fragments within three matrices: urban, agricultural and freshwater lake.LocationCity of Lahti and its surroundings, southern Finland.TaxonColeoptera, Carabidae.MethodsUsing pitfall traps from June to October 2019, we collected carabid beetles from eight spruce-dominated forest fragments in the urban matrix, 10 fragments in an agricultural matrix, seven fragments on lake islands and three large control forests at the outskirts of the city.ResultsCompared to natural forests, carabid beetles in forest fragments in these matrices showed distinct assemblages, and with beetle diversity the highest in fragments in the agricultural landscape. Fragments in the urban and lake island landscapes were characterised by small-sized species, and those capable of flight. We also found strong intraspecific trait responses in terms of body size, with some generalist species being significantly smaller in urban, agricultural or lake island fragments compared to the controls.Main ConclusionsThe matrix has a clear effect on carabid beetle communities, both in terms of taxonomic and trait distribution, and filters for communities of smaller sized species and those capable of flight. Such overall community and intraspecific effects can have considerable effects on populations and community assemblages: As anthropogenic effects intensify in urban and agricultural landscapes, our findings may be the expression of further morphological and physiological responses, and eventually in the adaptation of those species that can cope with the Anthropocene.

AB  - As political activists increasingly use social media in local protests, scholars must redirect attention from large-scale campaigns to scrutinize the ways in which geographically confined actors use social media to engage in protests. This paper analyses how a 2013 anti-mining campaign in Kallak, Sweden, combined on-site resistance with social media strategies via Facebook pages. The study examines which activist roles and forms of social media use that emerged and aims to explore what larger practical and theoretical implications one can derive from this specific case of place-based struggles. Results show that three typologically distinct activist roles emerged during the protests: local activists, digital movement intellectuals and digital distributors. These different types of actors were involved in four different forms of social media use: mobilization, construction of the physical space, extension of the local and augmentation of local and translocal bonds. Based on our findings, we argue that the coming together of these different activist roles and the different uses of social media added a translocal dimension to the peripheral and physically remote political conflict in Kallak. Media users were able to extend a locally and physically situated protest by linking it to a global contentious issue such as the mining boom and its consequences for indigenous populations.

AB  - Meteorological conditions can influence the main biological processes responsible of plant growth and development affecting vegetative growing, setting and ripening of different plant organs, onset and duration of phenological stages and the final production, exerting a strong impact on agricultural activities. In particular, the study of the variability of timing and length of the plants growing season is gaining importance because plant phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change and has large impacts on terrestrial ecosystems through changes in productivity and in the annual carbon and water cycles. For many years, starting from meteorological information, mathematical descriptions of these effects have been formulated in order to provide users (farmers, technicians, extension services, researchers, etc.) with operational tools for improving management and planning activities. Besides common meteorological information supplied by local or synoptic weather stations, the use of large-scale climatic variables has also been investigated in order to forecast agricultural yields and production quality in several regions of the world. In Europe, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) seems to be responsible for a large component of climate variability, particularly influencing winter and, through climate interactions on plants, crop production quality and quantity characteristics. The use of large-scale meteorological information showed great potential, particularly for the development of crop production forecasting systems.

AB  - Since 2014 Sweden has had a Feminist Foreign Policy (PEF in Spanish). This concept has been widely used in academic and political circles, without enough progress in its proper definition and delimitation. Scarce theoretical formulations, almost all of them coming from American and/or European academics, fail to provide the improvement of the concept and are limited to a series of minimal characteristics, which are influenced by a liberal and ethnocentric reading of feminism. It allows the notion of PEF to be used to refer to many diverse situations, and to establish, at least symbolically, a sign of equality between cases that have little elements in common; for instance, the foreign policies of Sweden, Canada, and Mexico. This situation is not insignificant, since, on the one hand, it reduces the importance and impact of the proposals that feminism has been developing for decades in the field of international relations theory; and on the other hand, it allows government officials and some intellectuals to appropriate and make superficial use of principles established in the intense struggles that women and other feminized sectors have been involved in for a long time.
   Faced with this panorama there is a need to conceptualize. It recovers the most transformative elements of the feminist tradition. To this end, we will problematize some theoretical definitions of PEF, and the self-denominated Feminist Foreign Policies currently in existence, showing the notable weaknesses and contradictions that cross them. We then proceed to the elaboration of a definition of PEF that incorporates elements coming from multiple feminisms (radical, decolonial black, indigenous), and that above all adopts explicitly a geographical, cultural, subalternate and counterhegemonic perspective. Likewise, we propose a gradual categorization of those foreign policies that begin to abandon androcentric and cisheteropatriarchal positioning, from the concepts of Foreign Policy with a Gender Perspective (PEPG in Spanish), and Foreign Policy with a Gender Perspective and Feminist Agenda (PEGAF in Spanish), and whose meanings we shall develop.
   Although the concept of PEF could be used for naming a foreign policy that gives a complete and uncontradicted account of the postulates upheld by feminism, we believe that it is more appropriate to use other, less comprehensive concepts. In general terms, the PEF corresponds to a liberal and institutional feminist approach, which underestimates other social actors as legitimate interlocutors. Their strategies are based on a gender mainstreaming approach, perfected in international organizations and replicated by various state entities; as such they ignore the ethnic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic particularities of the populations in which they are applied. In them, divergences between the multiple governmental spheres are not unusual. Moreover, even within the Ministries of Foreign Affairs it is possible to identify notorious incongruities between sectors that are, or are not, crossed by the gender perspective.
   Secondly, we suggest the use of the concept of Foreign Policy with a Gender Perspective and Feminist Agenda. Considering that the levels are cumulative, to the previous characterization, we add the importance of substantive representation; the identification and sanctioning of the different forms of violence within and outside national borders; and the need to at least begin to question the heteropatriarchal structures of oppression from a discursive point of view, for which the field of diplomacy is fundamental. This gradually problematizes the meanings and stereotypes disseminated by institutions, understanding that the dispute over women's rights and other sex gender identities must also take place at the symbolic level.
   In the Swedish case, we understand that it corresponds to what we have called PEGAF. Indeed, Sweden has done important work concerning development assistance, and the financing of international institutions related to the protection of rights and the empowerment of women. Likewise, of all the cases considered, Sweden is the one in which there is the greatest congruence between its foreign policy and its domestic policy, as well as the work that the Nordic country has been carrying out within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consolidate a gender approach. Even from a discursive point of view, the Swedish authorities have questioned certain characteristics of the international system, and have had diplomatic disputes with some countries based on issues related to the violation of human rights. However, none of the above has been sustained over time, and the back and forth has been constant. There have been notable discrepancies in the commitment to a feminist agenda among the different ministries, and in some areas, such as defense, the transformations have been insignificant. In addition, on many occasions, Sweden has abandoned its commitment to the defense of feminist postulates, when obstacles or risks have arisen in relation to the national interest-as defined in androcentric terms. The conservative turn in immigration matters, or the government's refusal to confront the strategic sector of the arms industry, are evidence of this.
   Based on the analysis carried out on the case of Canada, we consider that this country can be framed within Foreign Policies with Gender Perspectives (PEPG), since it presents domestic and international antecedents in the work on women's issues. However, the fact that it defines its foreign policy only in one area, such as development assistance, and focuses its empirical work mainly on economic issues, means that it does not achieve the necessary comprehensiveness to place it at the highest level. Likewise, Canada does not make progress in criticizing or questioning, even discursively, the hegemonic global dynamics and institutions, nor does it question its place in the international structure.
   Finally, evaluating the Mexican case, we ask ourselves: How can we think of a feminist foreign policy when at the domestic level the drug cartels and human trafficking networks continue to exercise their power and violence with total impunity, and in conjunction with broad sectors of politics, justice and the police? How could the Mexican PEF make sense in a country where people continue to "disappear" or become victims of extrajudicial executions within the framework of democracy, most of the time with representatives of the security forces as the ones responsible? In which part of the gender equality plan can we frame the femicides and transfemicides that place Mexico as one of the most dangerous countries to be a woman or dissident of the heteronorma? Regrettably, we consider that the country is not even in a position to aspire to the lowest level described here -that is,the PEPG-since all its current actions (and those of the last decades) are detrimental to the values and principles that the feminist stance upholds.
   The criticisms raised in the three case studies addressed has sought to identify their weaknesses and to construct more appropriate concepts that would point to the different types of external policies that are currently oriented towards women. Moreover, this would make it possible to define them with an appropriate term that is in line with their real actions and not mere rhetoric. Our work, of course, is not limited to a conceptual correction; but, above all, it tries to generate a concrete contribution for the generation of tools and the definition of public policies that have a positive impact on the life of the communities represented.

AB  - The need to decrease emissions from the transport sector is getting urgent and public transport can play an important role in the transition to low emission fuels. To a large extent, public transport in Europe is provided by regional authorities who controls the traffic to a varying degree, from complete public monopoly to competitive tendering. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how the organisation of the public bus transport market influences the introduction of renewable fuels. The focus is on understanding what the motivation is for the use of different organisational forms and what challenges and opportunities the authorities in a region encounter during the introduction of renewable fuels. Interviews with authorities in ten Swedish public transport regions show that when functional requirements are used in competitive tendering it will exclusively result in the cheapest renewable fuel available. Thus, if new fuels or technologies should be able to enter the market, either it will be necessary for regional authorities to take more control using specific requirements or publicly management, or the national government must introduce policy instruments that enable new renewable fuels to become competitive on the market.

AB  - Patterns of distribution and ecospace utilization of Late Ordovician brachiopods in a recently formed, contemporary meteorite crater are described and analyzed. Rhynchonelliformean brachiopod communities, dominated by a wide range of orthides and strophomenides, colonized the newly formed crater. At the crater rim communities were established early on, although the crater depression was not inhabited until deposition of the upper third of the remaining crater fill. The crater formed a protected but restricted microenvironment where sediments four times the thickness of the nearby basinal succession accumulated. Within this narrow space environments varied from shallow-water to deeper-waters, about 200 m in depth, and from well oxygenated to hypoxic. Such varied environments generated a rough ecological landscape, facilitating niche partitioning across a relatively small geographic area. Analysis of the guild structure of the fauna permits explanation of a local biodiversity hotspot in otherwise low-diversity strata elsewhere in the Scandinavian region. The Tvaren impact event had an important palaeobiologic effect upon the fossil record as it served as a local pump and reservoir for biodiversity. Moreover the development of new community types and narrowly-defined niches helped further drive both a and p biodiversity during a critical phase of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest biomass can be used as source of renewable energy, contributing to mitigate climate change. Currently, forest biomass is one of the most important energy sources in Sweden, accounting for around 20% of the total supply. New demands of forest biomass may be expected due to the European Union energy targets, the previous high oil prices, the energy supply security, and the bioenergy market. However, the supply depends on the intensity of conventional final felling operations. Thus, it is crucial to determine the energy demands of conventional and new forest assortment supply chains and promote those with the highest energy efficiency and least greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An attributional life cycle assessment approach was used to evaluate the fuel consumption and GHG emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels used in forest operations, transportation and comminution of forest biomass procured via two kinds of supply chains in Northern Sweden: conventional and integrated. The results indicate that most fuel was consumed in transportation processes. The integrated supply chains (in which the harvesting of industrial roundwood is integrated with extraction of forest fuels) are more energy efficient than conventional supply chains, and have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 13%.Abbreviation: BWT: bundled whole small trees; CTL: Cut-to-length; ET: energy thinning; FF: final felling; FT: first thinning; FU: functional unit; GHG: greenhouse gas; GWP: global warming potential; LCA: life cycle assessment; LR: logging residues; LT: long tops; ODt: oven dry tonne; ORN: ornskoldsvik (industrial location); PCT: pre-commercial thinning; PL: pulpwood; PM(15)h: Productive machine hours including delays shorter than 15min; RS: Rough-delimbed tree sections; SC: stump core; SL: sawlogs; SP: stumps; ST: second thinning; STO: Storuman (industrial location); u.b: under bark; UME: Umea (industrial location)

AB  - Key message Climate envelope analysis of nine tree species shows that Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies H. Karst could lose 58% and 40% of their current distribution range. Quercus pubescens Willd and Quercus cerris L. may win areas equal with 47% and 43% of their current ranges. The ratio of poorly predictable areas increases by 105% in southern and south-eastern Europe. Context Climate change requires adaptive forest management implementations. To achieve climate neutrality, we have to maintain and expand forest areas. Impact assessments have great importance. Aims The study estimates the potential climate envelopes of nine European tree species for a past period (1961-1990) and for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100) under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) based on the current species distribution. Methods Climate envelopes were estimated simultaneously using the random forest method. Multi-resolution segmentation was used to determine the climatic characteristics of each species and their combinations. Models were limited to the geographical area within which the climatic conditions correspond to the climatic range of the training areas. Results Results showed remarkable changes in the extent of geographic areas of all the investigated species' climate envelopes. Many of the tree species of Central Europe could lose significant portions of their distribution range. Adhering to the shift in climate, these tree species shift further north as well as towards higher altitudes. Conclusion European forests face remarkable changes, and the results support climate envelope modelling as an important tool that provides guidelines for climate adaptation to identify threatened areas or to select source and destination areas for reproductive material.

AB  - The speed and progress of transitions towards renewable energy systems varies greatly between European member states. Among others, these differences have been attributed to the emergence of grassroots initiatives (GIs) that develop radical ideas and sustainable practices. The goal of this paper is to understand the differences in the emergence of GIs for renewable energy in relation to the institutional characteristics of Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. We analyze the possibilities of GIs to emerge and act within three dimensions: the material-economic, the actor-institutional and discursive dimension. We conclude that conditional factors lie within the material-economic dimension in terms of the biophysical conditions, the structure of the economy, energy dependency and the energy market. Within the actor-institutional dimension, we conclude that the presence or absence of fossil fuel incumbents, such as regional utilities, strongly influence the possibilities of GIs. Within the discursive dimension, openness for alternative discourses proved to be enabling for GI-activities, as well as democratized knowledge production. In addition to these conditions of possibility, GIs can also act despite dominant institutions, albeit limited. Finally, GIs need a strong network with knowledge institutes, technology developers and political parties in order to achieve institutional change that enables GIs to flourish. Without institutional space, GIs remain subjected to the dominant power-relations, and cannot exert much influence upon the energy system.

AB  - The aim of this chapter is to introduce the UbiGo transport broker service developed in Gothenburg, Sweden, and to discuss insights from the six-month field operational test regarding incentives for users adopting new travel services as well as perceived added value. Results are presented from participant questionnaires, interviews, and travel diaries. Findings suggest that potential early users are initially incentivized by curiosity, but that this must be transformed into practical incentives such as convenience and economic advantage if the users are to continue using the service. Customers also found added value in the "transportation smorgasbord" concept, 24-hour customer support, new types of subscriptions and tickets, and having everything in their smartphone, but wished for more personalized decision support and feedback. Concern for the environment functioned more as a bonus than as an incentive, meaning that the environmentally friendly choice must also be the practical choice in order to promote sustainability.

AB  - To achieve the universal target of 'safely managed sanitation' set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal 6, the world needs to increase its rate of progress, since e.g. Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, currently has zero percent safely managed sanitation. One way to promote safer faecal sludge management is to shift to a more circular system with nutrient recycling, but this carries the risk of heavy metal accumulation in the environment. This study analysed the concentrations of heavy metals in raw faecal sludge from various sources and assessed the appropriateness of resource recovery and reuse in relation to the heavy metal and nutrient loads in faecal sludge. A total of 42 samples collected from sludge disposal sites in Phnom Penh during the dry and rainy seasons were analysed for heavy metals and physicochemical parameters. Mean measured concentrations of heavy metals in faecal sludge samples decreased in the order Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Ni > Hg > As > Cd in both seasons but were higher in the rainy season, probably due partly to inflow from stormwater drains and run-off from roads during storm events. All elements analysed were within the permissible limits for application to land according to EU standards and USEPA. However, Hg and Zn concentrations exceeded the tolerance limits for local organic fertiliser and Swedish limits for compost. Faecal sludge is thus not an appropriate fertiliser considering the risk of heavy metal accumulation in relation to phosphorus recovered. Options to avoid recirculating pollutants to the environment include upstream prevention of pollution, source separation of household wastewater fractions and use of biosolids as a soil conditioner together with other fertilisers or for soil production. Additional studies are needed on these options if sanitation stakeholders are to close the nutrient loop.

AB  - Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) is one of the most valuable shellfish resources in the Mediterranean and the northeast Atlantic. Sustainable management of its fishery require long-term scientific monitoring of its stocks. Population dynamics, fishery, and exploitation status of the Norway lobster were studied over a long time series (between 2008 and 2014) in a semi enclosed gulf in Easter Mediterranean (Pagasitikos Gulf). Sampling was carried out using a commercial bottom trawl with a codend mesh size of 28 mm in three different regions within the Gulf. Sex was identified macroscopically and all individuals were measured and weighed. Growth and Age groups were investigated by analysis of length-frequency distributions of the Carapace length (CL) for both sexes. Fishing, Natural and Total Mortality, along with Exploitation rate of the total stock were estimated by the FiSAT software package. Females were further examined and classified based on their maturity stage and the size at onset of sexual maturity was estimated by Probit analysis. Temporal differences in mean CL were detected for both sexes, with a tendency of lower values each year, along with a respective increase in Fishing Mortality and Exploitation Rate, indicating the effects of fishing pressure over the population. Size at onset of sexual maturity was estimated at 32.6 mm, higher than the official mesh sizes for creels (28 mm) and gillnets (26 mm). According to the analyses, the local Norway lobster stock is over-exploited, which should be taken under consideration by the regional policy makers.

AB  - The present study examines parental discipline. Parents in 200 families with children aged 1-7 years were asked how to handle conflicts in a dressing, a playing, a traffic, a shopping and a bedtime situation. According to ''Parental Discipline Interview'' the methods selected were: Low Use of Authority (34%), Coercive Verbal Control (31%), Behavior Modification (15%), Physical Restraint (13%), Reasoning (6%) and Physical Punishment (1%). Reasoning and Behavior Modification were used more frequently by mothers. Characteristics of the child, such as age, sex and temperament, as well as characteristics of the parents, such as age, traditional or progressive attitudes and social status, predicted disciplinary methods selected.

AB  - While cooperative organizations created with the aim to initiate, develop, and operate renewable electricity (RE) projects have received attention for their roles in the transition to a sustainable energy system, the disparities in the number of RE cooperative projects among countries suggest that institutional contexts may have an impact on their deployment. In order to systematically identify the systemic factors that impact their deployment, we use an established framework, considering the strengths and weaknesses in market structure, infrastructures, institutions, interactions, and capabilities. We compare the deployment context in Germany, France, and Sweden in order to understand which systemic factors have an impact and how they affect RE cooperative projects. Based on a review of the literature and qualitative interviews with experts in RE cooperatives, it appears that, although RE cooperative projects share some obstacles with most new entrants of RE, they are particularly exposed to a lack of financial infrastructure, a lack of knowledge and interactions, and problems related to a lack of regulatory frameworks facilitating their deployment. Results also show that systemic factors are complementary and dependent on each other: lowering one barrier lowers other barriers, and some obstacles strengthen other obstacles. Drawing on the comparison among Germany, France, and Sweden, we highlight some interesting practices that could be used in the coordination and alignment of systemic conditions for the deployment of RE cooperative projects.

AB  - Coastal eutrophication is a major environmental issue worldwide. In the Baltic Sea, eutrophication affects both the coastal waters and the open sea. Various policy frameworks aim to hinder its progress but eutrophicationrelevant water quality variables, such as chlorophyll-a concentrations, still exhibit opposite temporal trends in various Baltic Sea marine and coastal waters. In this study, we investigate the temporal-trend linkages of measured water quality variables and their various anthropogenic, climatic and hydrospheric drivers over the period 1990-2020 with focus on the Swedish coastal waters and related marine basins in the Baltic Sea. We find that it is necessary to distinguish more and less isolated coastal waters, based on their water exchanges with the open sea, to capture different coastal eutrophication dynamics. In less isolated coastal waters, eutrophication is primarily related to nitrogen concentrations, while it is more related to phosphorus concentrations in more isolated coastal waters. In the open sea, trends in eutrophication conditions correlate best with trends in climatic and hydrospheric drivers, like wind speed and water salinity, respectively. In the coastal waters, driver signals are more mixed, with considerable influences from anthropogenic land-based nutrient loads and sea ice cover duration. Summer chlorophyll-a concentration in the open sea stands out as a main change driver of summer chlorophyll-a concentration in less isolated coastal waters. Overall, coastal waters are a melting pot of driver influences over various scales, from local land-based drivers to large-scale total catchment and open sea conditions. The latter in turn depend on long-term integration of pathway-dependent influences from the various coastal parts of the Baltic Sea and their land-based nutrient load drivers, combined with overarching climate conditions and internal feedback loops. As such, our results challenge any unidirectional local source-to-sea paradigm and emphasize a need for concerted local land-catchment and whole-sea measures for robust coastal eutrophication management.

AB  - This article draws on theories of bordering and mediated witnessing to examine a documentary film that mediates migrants' experiences of bordering in Europe. My analysis of Under den samme himmel/Days of Hope shows how the film captures the multiplicity of bordering practices, from geographical to socio-cultural borderings. The analysis is informed by watching and discussing the film in an immigrant detention facility in Finland with people who experienced and eye-witnessed experiences similar to those depicted in the film. This creates a sense of co-presence of the experiential landscapes in the border zones, and the film invites viewers to consider borders not as lines in the landscape, but as zones and as a form of practice that has consequences.

AB  - The greenhouse sector has seen many advances to improve its resource demands, though little is known of the environmental impacts. This study aims to assess the environmental performance of a horticultural greenhouse in Sweden producing herbs. Life cycle assessment is employed to analyze different scenarios. These include previous measures, such as switching to organic fertilizers, a pellet burner, and reducing the packaging weight. Future scenarios are assessed, including increasing biofueled logistics, switching to LEDs, densifying production, and including recyclable packaging. The results suggest that GHG emissions were reduced by 32% per kg edible portion through past scenarios in current scenario. Additionally, densifying production and switching to LED lighting can lead to an additional 14% and 10% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the current system respectively, while also reducing other environmental impact categories. These results provide insights into the implications of environmental and resource improvement measures taken at greenhouses.

AB  - Organic geochemical assessment of seep oil from the Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) Boda Limestone and solid bitumens from the Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) limestone formations in the Siljan Crater, Sweden indicates their generation primarily from peak oil window maturity, clay-rich marine source rocks that contained aquatic algal organic matter and were deposited in an anoxic environment. Biomarkers indicate some significant differences between the seep oil and solid bitumens and their alteration by moderate to severe biodegradation. The Solberga quarry seep oil from the Boda Limestone and Solberga-1 solid bitumen from the Skarlov-Seby-Folkslunda Limestone equivalents do not show signs of mixing and the similarity in their biomarker distributions indicates a genetic relationship. However, solid bitumens recovered from cavities in the underlying Segerstad and Holen limestones were derived predominantly from clay-rich source rocks that contained mixed marine and lacustrine algal organic matter and minor inputs of prokaryotic organic matter, possibly from thin beds of calcareous rocks interbedded within the main clay-rich source rocks. It is inferred that the Siljan Crater seep oil and solid bitumens were generated from the organic rich Upper Ordovician Fjacka Shale, a source rock for economic accumulation of oil in the eastern Baltic region, and/or from Silurian shale units. The presence of various compounds of known biological origin and existence of organic rich Fjacka Shale/Silurian Shale units are consistent with the biogenic origin of Siljan Crater petroleum. Although these seep oil and solid bitumens were generated at peak oil window maturities, the intense heat generated by meteorite impact caused secondary reactions resulting in unusual distributions of maturity sensitive aromatic hydrocarbon isomers and conflicting molecular maturities.

AB  - This article critically examines the state's steering capacity of 'green innovation' programs using Sweden's implementation of the agricultural European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) as a case representing part of the EU's Green Deal. The innovations should promote the competi-tiveness of rural areas and contribute to national environmental protection and climate goals.We found that despite expectations, implementation rests on compartmentalized networking within the agricultural sector, prioritizing increased 'competitiveness' before 'green' develop-ment, and interpreting 'innovation' mainly in the technical sense. The results indicate that the state ' s steering capacity of 'green innovation' programs meets several obstacles: the overall goals from the top tend to be both too many and too vague, leaving it to the administration to interpret what kinds of features should be prioritized from below. The state's steering in the case of EIP-AGRI relies mostly on internal agricultural expertise contrary to previous research that sug-gests a recent 'de-compartmentalisation' of European agricultural policymaking.

AB  - Oak trees are biodiversity hotspots in many landscapes and provide habitats for several organism groups, including species that are rare or threatened by extinction. Oak regeneration in the northern hemisphere is often poor, which is a serious problem in many oak-rich conservation forests. Competition from other vegetation and browsing by ungulates are two factors that limit oak regeneration. In 13 mixed oak-rich forests with high values for biodiversity we tested conservation-oriented thinning. Trees and shrubs were harvested for biofuel, but the main aim was to favour oak regeneration and biodiversity. On average, 23% of the initial basal area was removed during the winter 2002/2003. After thinning, we set up exclosures to protect oak seedlings from browsing. In 2012, after ten growing seasons, the exclosures had favoured regeneration of oak by reducing ungulate browsing, though the effect was weak. Tall oak saplings (>130 cm) were present in exclosures at five sites, and no such new stems were recorded in control plots with browsing. These five sites were characterized by higher canopy openness, and probably higher light availability, compared to the other sites. Other broadleaves, and especially shrubs, increased much more in density and height than oaks, in both exclosures and control plots. Thus, conservation-oriented thinning in combination with fences to protect oak seedlings from browsing ungulates, increased oak regeneration in the mixed conservation forests, but control of competing understory vegetation in exclosures is probably also needed.

AB  - Pollen productivity estimates (PPE) are needed for producing quantitative reconstructions of the past landscapes by means of modelling. This study aims to provide estimates of relative pollen productivity for the two main tree species (Pinus sylvestris L. and Betula sp.), for Cyperaceae and Gramineae, and the dominant dwarf shrubs (Empetrum, Vaccinium sp.) of northern boreal forest vegetation in Finnish Lapland. A set of 24 moss samples were collected and their pollen content analysed, and detailed vegetation analyses were carried out within a 10.5 m radius around the samples. Vegetation further away, up to 10 km from the sites, was analysed from the Finnish Land Survey data. Vegetation proportions were calculated from the remotely sensed data using the program PolFlow, and distance weighting was applied using the program ERV_v6. The distance weighted vegetation data from the field survey and the Land Survey data were combined, and analysed with the pollen data using the ERV model. The resulting PPEs were evaluated by simulating pollen loadings with the POLLSCAPE model for an independent set of eight moss samples from the same area, using the obtained PPEs. The estimated pollen loadings and the observed pollen loadings were compared using paired samples t-tests. The PPEs obtained for the two major tree species are in keeping with expectations: PPE for Pinus is 8.4 (reference taxon Gramineae= 1) and for Betula 4.6. For Cyperaceae (0.002), Empetrum (0.07), and Vaccinium (0.01) the PPEs are very low and, according to paired samples t-test of the predicted and actual pollen loading, not reliable for Cyperaceae and Gramineae. The radius of the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) is estimated to be ca. 1000 m. The pollen productivity estimates of the species, especially Pinus and Betula, are different in the northern boreal forest than in previously studied areas, such as southern Sweden. This has great implications for quantitative interpretations of fossil pollen records from the region. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Timetables are important for train punctuality. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the people who plan the timetables: the research has instead been more centred on how to improve timetables through simulation, optimisation, and data analysis techniques. In this study, we present an overview of the state of practice and the state of the art in timetable planning by studying the research literature and railway management documents from several European countries. We have also conducted interviews with timetable planners in Southern Sweden, focusing on how timetable planning relates to punctuality problems. An important backdrop for this is a large project currently underway at the Swedish Transport Administration, modernizing the timetable planning tools and processes. This study is intended to help establish a baseline for the future evaluation of this modernization by documenting the current process and issues, as well as some of the research that has influenced the development and specifications of the new tools and processes. Based on the interviews, we found that errors in timetables commonly lead to infeasible timetables, which necessitate intervention by traffic control, and to delays occurring, increasing, and spreading. We found that the timetable planners struggle to create a timetable and that they have neither the time nor the tools required to ensure that the timetable maintains a high quality and level of robustness. The errors we identified are (a) crossing train paths at stations, (b) wrong track allocation of trains at stations, especially for long trains, (c) insufficient dwell and meet times at stations, and (d) insufficient headways leading to delays spreading. We have identified eleven reasons for these errors and found three themes among these reasons: (1) "missing tools and support," (2) "role conflict," and (3) "single-loop learning." As the new tools and processes are rolled out, the situation is expected to improve with regard to the first of these themes. The second theme of role conflict occurs when planners must strive to meet the demands of the train operating companies, while they must also be unbiased and create a timetable that has a high overall quality. While this role conflict will remain in the future, the new tools can perhaps help address the third theme by elevating the planners from first-to double-loop learning and thereby allowing them to focus on quality control and on finding better rules and heuristics. Over time, this will lead to improved timetable robustness and train punctuality.

AB  - In this short communication, we present a pilot study testing a new close-range sensing technology - a portable, pushbroom hyperspectral camera - in varying field conditions in forests. We evaluate how measurement conditions affect the in situ collection of stem bark spectra. In situ spectral libraries of woody elements are needed in, e.g., physically-based remote sensing applications, biodiversity mapping, and 3D vegetation modeling. Recent technological advancements bring portable and close-range capable sensors, such as small pushbroom imaging spectrometers, for consumer and research use. However, it is important to investigate the strengths and limitations of sensors utilizing pushbroom technology. Spectral measurements under forest canopies are challenging due to varying illumination conditions, which can have a significant effect on the quality of the data. We acquired hyperspectral reflectance images of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) stem bark directly in the forest. For each tree we collected reflectance images at 30-minute intervals throughout a day from a fixed view angle. The most significant change in the measured spectra occurred due to spatially varying irradiance between the white reference panel and the bark surface. The spatial variation of irradiance had the largest effect on data quality in visible and red-edge regions, and the smallest in near-infrared. In non-diffuse conditions, changes in irradiance were often unpredictable as clouds or canopy elements moved in and out of the direct solar beams. Diffuse overcast days with clouds can extend the time window for measurements, making it a practical choice for acquiring hyperspectral images of stem bark. We concluded that with a well-planned measurement set-up it is possible to improve the precision of in situ collected spectra of stem bark.

AB  - Production and consumption of food and in a rural area over the last 400 years were reconstructed for a parish in south east Sweden. This was based on a number of different data sources, including historical maps and official demographic and agricultural statistics. Changes in population (and thus consumption) and the production from arable land and livestock were calculated and used to provide an estimate of the area's supply and demand over time, and of the historical sustainability of the area. Overall food productivity was remarkably constant over time, at approximately 0.04 kgC m(-2) y(-1), despite recent changes in population size and the area of cultivated land. The empirical results from the past and the present, together with the future land changes due to shoreline displacement were used to predict the situation in the future. These final estimates can be used in the assessment of risk for exposure to contaminated food for the future population in the area.

AB  - Four pollen diagrams, which together cover the period 10400 cal bp to the present, from an area rich in Stone Age house foundations show that vegetation was increasingly influenced by man in a stepwise process. There was a modest, temporary appearance of anthropogenically-induced vegetation about 8600 cal bp. After 7100 cal bp there was a development towards semi-open birch woodland where the open patches were characterised by natural heath and meadow species and more typical apophytic taxa such as Ranunculus acris and Rumex acetosa types, grasses and juniper. The main changes towards this vegetation seem connected with the most important cultural changes, especially at about 7100 cal bp, when there was a transition to honed slate tools in the regional archaeology, at about 4000 cal bp when pottery was introduced, and at about 3000 - 2800 cal bp since when the use of stone artefacts gradually ceased. It is suggested that the settlements were mainly summer habitations.

AB  - 1. Patterns in species assemblages are the result of the combined influence of processes acting on different spatial scales. Various studies describe the distribution of macroinvertebrate communities and their relationship with environmental factors at different geographical scales, but only a few of these studies concentrate on Western European lowlands.
   2. Using Flanders as representative for the densely populated Western-European lowlands, the specific aims of this study are: (i) to identify the different trichopteran species assemblages and to characterise them biologically using indicator species; (ii) to determine which environmental gradients most influence the observed species assemblages; and (iii) to analyse the relative importance of different spatial scale variables in constraining the Trichoptera distributions.
   3. Assessment of the main environmental gradients suggested that the absence of Trichoptera from certain locations was mainly due to elevated nutrient concentrations and lower oxygen contents, confirming their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance.
   4. Five Trichoptera species assemblages were distinguished based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity coefficients. These assemblages did not differ significantly in species richness, but a shift in stream zonation preference was observed. In the ordination analysis 11 variables that were selected using a stepwise model building function manifested themselves as upstream-downstream and size-related gradients. The Trichoptera assemblages in lowland streams thus appear to follow a longitudinal succession pattern that corresponds with the species-specific preferences.
   5. Partitioning the variance over the different spatial scales indicated that the reach-scale variables were far more important in explaining the variation in species composition. The study design, which limited the minimum-maximum range of catchment-scale characteristics, however, may have led to an overestimation of the impact of the local-scale variables.

AB  - A promising way to reduce environmental impacts of consumer expenditure is through the encouragement of more sustainable consumption patterns. Consumers cause environmental impacts both directly, such as by fuel use in personal cars, and indirectly, by paying for the production of consumables. With increased international trade, the indirect environmental impacts are difficult to determine because a portion of the emissions occurs in different geographical regions. Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced using domestic production technology. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study applies a methodology that explicitly includes technology differences to the case of Norwegian households. It is found that a significant portion of pollution is embodied in Norwegian household imports. Further, a disproportionately large amount of pollution is embodied in imports from developing countries. Overall, as in previous studies, we find that mobility and food are most important in terms of household environmental impacts. By analyzing the imports in more detail we find that for some sectors the majority of emissions occur in foreign regions; in particular, this is true for food, business services, clothing, chemicals, furniture, cars, agriculture, textiles, and most manufactured products.

AB  - We examine how nutrient load compensation could help a firm expand its production when production is a source of nutrient loads, threatening the ecological status of a water body. We ask whether compensation is technically feasible and whether it can be made in an ecologically sustainable way. Credits for compensation may be provided by point or nonpoint sources. We apply our approach to the case of Finnish Lake Kallavesi, where the Supreme Administrative Court, based on the Water Framework Directive, refused an environmental permit for a plan to build a large pulp mill. We employ a lake nutrient response model to determine water quality using probabilistic analysis of the ecological status of the lake. The supply potential of phosphorus credits from point sources was too low to keep the lake in good ecological status with at least 80% probability and must be complemented by credits from agricultural nonpoint sources. Using a trade ratio of 1:1.2 to reflect uncertainty on credits from nonpoint sources suggests that the reduction in agricultural phosphorus loading would suffice on its own to ensure the good ecological status by 90% probability. The cost of buying nutrient reduction credits would be at most 2% of the investment.

AB  - Understanding and unravelling the direct and indirect effects of ongoing and predicted climate change on the vitality and productivity of Scots pine forests is particularly important for Romania and other parts of eastern Europe, where the species represents an essential ecological and economic value. Here, we introduce the first nation-wide network of 34 Scots pine chronologies of basal area increment (BAI), and assess the species' vulnerability to climate change. Temperatures of the previous autumn, as well as current year spring and summer warmth are found to be most critical for the productivity of Romania's Scots pine forests. Negative growth anomalies after hot and dry August conditions are most severe in young (< 50 years) Scots pine monocultures (> 70% dominance) at lower elevations (< 1000 m a.s.l.) across western Romania. Our findings emphasise the relevance and timeliness of carefully adapting sylvicultural management strategies to enhance the ecological and economic resilience of Romania's widespread forest areas under a warmer and drier future climate.

AB  - There has been long-standing interest in the history of human health and well-being over the millennia. The major sources of information are written accounts of life in the past, such as wills, diaries, tax records, military records, and court documents. These sources, however, may be inaccurate and are susceptible to distortion by selective reporting and biases in the cultural perspectives and objectives of both writers and users. Data on variation in the heights of people who lived over the last several centuries have recently become available for several populations and provide a less subjective source of information on the history of health (for a review see Steckel(1)). Although valuable, these records are mostly for males living in now-industrialized nations such as Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States; they certainly do not provide a comprehensive picture of the history of health across continents or regions. Moreover, height measures only one dimension of health during the years of human growth and development. It does not provide an overall measure of health status throughout the life cycle.

AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of the practice of implementation the concept of universal basic income. It is shown that in estimating the results of a series of experiments in this field, conducted in a number of countries, it is recommended to abandon the approach based on the positivist point of view. For a long time, it dominated science in general and economic research in particular, but it continues to influence many researchers today. This conclusion should be taken into account in the formation of the structure and composition of regions' welfare indices. The research materials are placed in a broad historical context. On the one hand, this made it possible to more vividly present the prerequisites, characteristics and consequences of repeated attempts to introduce universal basic income into the practice of social insurance, undertaken in different countries of the world (Finland, Canada, Kenya, Iran, India, USA). On the other hand, to reveal the possibilities and problems of using universal basic income as a tool to help overcome the dysfunctional development of certain territories, including mining regions.

AB  - Increased Muslim immigration and conversion to Islam have influenced the rise of Islamic schools in the western countries. Islamic schools existed in the western world long before the modern era in medieval Spain. Islamic institutions became the center of learning for young scholars from Europe and many works of literature and science were translated from foreign languages to Arabic and other languages spoken in the Muslim world in the golden medieval age of Islam in the tenth and eleventh centuries (Coulson, 1999, p. 60-64). Decentralization and market orientation were the key attributes of Islamic schooling up to the eleventh century (Coulson, 1999; Durant, 1950, p. 94, 304). Thereafter, Islamic scholarship declined, reaching its nadir in the colonial era in the fifteenth to early nineteenth century. Some sources cite the number of illiterate Muslims to be approximately 40% in the current decade. On the other hand, Muslim immigrants have settled in the cultural west in increasing numbers in the last three decades and conversion to Islam has increased.
   A minority of Muslims in the western countries attends Islamic schools (Merry, 2005). While only three percent of American Muslims attend privately funded Islamic schools (O'Neill, 2010, p. 5) and four percent of Dutch Muslims attend state funded and privately run Islamic schools (Kiefer, 2005), these numbers are increasing rapidly due to cultural and religious demands of the Muslim community in the last two decades. Molook (2005) describes the formation of Islamic schools in the US due to parental dissatisfaction with the traditional public school system, an alien social environment for Muslim students in public schools and concerns about assimilation. Elbih (2012) argues that Islamic schools can create well-adjusted individuals for the society who understand both religious and democratic values.
   Following the demise of the Soviet Union and especially after 9/11, policymakers have viewed Islamic schools in the west with skepticism due to concerns regarding domestic and international politics, civic values and possible segregation of Muslims. Critics also accuse Islamic schools of segregating Muslim students, promoting patriarchy and authoritarianism over female students and promoting religious intolerance (Elbih, 2012). The research on Islamic schools has largely been qualitative in nature. To better understand policy relevant issues, more research is needed. Alternately, consolidation of the existing research offers insights as to variation in Islamic schooling across nations. Here, I review Islamic schools in the "cultural west." I use the term cultural west from a traditional Islamic perspective chiefly the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Sweden, and Spain.
   This review adds to the literature on Islamic schools in the cultural west by summarizing over fifty studies in English collected through google scholar (about 8360 sources including citations).
   This paper summarizes literature on Islamic schools in the cultural west. Islamic schools are both formal and informal, and are schools of choice. I discuss three policy relevant issues concerning:
   1) the purpose and nature of Islamic schooling,
   2) parental and student preferences; and
   3) the quality of Islamic schooling.
   The review reveals a variation in education policy issues where some countries fund private Islamic schools and others provide Islamic religious instruction in the public schools.

AB  - Predicting climate-driven changes in plant distribution is crucial for biodiversity conservation and management under recent climate change. Climate warming is expected to induce movement of species upslope and towards higher latitudes. However, the mechanisms and physiological processes behind the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution range of a tree species are complex and depend on each tree species features and vary over ontogenetic stages. We investigated the altitudinal distribution differences between juvenile and adult individuals of seven major European tree species along elevational transects covering a wide latitudinal range from southern Spain (37 degrees N) to northern Sweden (67 degrees N). By comparing juvenile and adult distributions (shifts on the optimum position and the range limits) we assessed the response of species to present climate conditions in relation to previous conditions that prevailed when adults were established. Mean temperature increased by 0.86 degrees C on average at our sites during the last decade compared with previous 30-year period. Only one of the species studied, Abies alba, matched the expected predictions under the observed warming, with a maximum abundance of juveniles at higher altitudes than adults. Three species, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, showed an opposite pattern while for other three species, such as Quercus ilex, Acer pseudoplatanus and Q. petraea, we were no able to detect changes in distribution. These findings are in contrast with theoretical predictions and show that tree responses to climate change are complex and are obscured not only by other environmental factors but also by internal processes related to ontogeny and demography.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of fishing on the seabed is a basic requirement for ecosystem-based marine management. It is only recently that we have begun understanding how fisheries-driven perturbations affect ecosystem function, biodiversity, productivity, and resilience. Technical solutions aimed at minimizing seabed impacts are starting to appear, but their efficacy remains to be demonstrated. In 2014, ICES held a symposium on the effects of fishing on benthic fauna, habitat, and ecosystem function, in Tromso, Norway. The main goals of the symposium were to summarize current understanding of the physical and biological effects of fishing activities on benthic ecosystems, and to review the diversity of technical measures currently available to mitigate these effects. Here, we briefly describe the background to the scientific symposium and highlight the main contributions.

TI  - Climatic variation drives loss and restructuring of carbon and nitrogen in boreal forest wildfire
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - The boreal forest landscape covers approximately 10 % of the earth's land area and accounts for almost 30 % of the global annual terrestrial sink of carbon (C). Increased emissions due to climate-change-amplified fire frequency, size, and intensity threaten to remove elements such as C and nitrogen (N) from forest soil and vegetation at rates faster than they accumulate. This may result in large areas within the region becoming a net source of greenhouse gases, creating a positive feedback loop with a changing climate. Meter-scale estimates of area-normalized fire emissions are limited in Eurasian boreal forests, and knowledge of their relation to climate and ecosystem properties is sparse. This study sampled 50 separate Swedish wildfires, which occurred during an extreme fire season in 2018, providing quantitative estimates of C and N loss due to fire along a climate gradient. Mean annual precipitation had strong positive effects on total fuel, which was the strongest driver for increasing C and N losses. Mean annual temperature (MAT) influenced both pre- and postfire organic layer soil bulk density and C : N ratio, which had mixed effects on C and N losses. Significant fire-induced loss of C estimated in the 50 plots was comparable to estimates in similar Eurasian forests but approximately a quarter of those found in typically more intense North American boreal wildfires. N loss was insignificant, though a large amount of fire-affected fuel was converted to a low C : N surface layer of char in proportion to increased MAT. These results reveal large quantitative differences in C and N losses between global regions and their linkage to the broad range of climate conditions within Fennoscandia. A need exists to better incorporate these factors into models to improve estimates of global emissions of C and N due to fire in future climate scenarios. Additionally, this study demonstrated a linkage between climate and the extent of charring of soil fuel and discusses its potential for altering C and N dynamics in postfire recovery.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) associated with higher risks of extreme birth size and/or preterm birth in mothers with different hypertension types?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: PCOS was associated with additional risks of preterm birth in mothers with chronic hypertension and in singleton pregnancies of mothers with pre-eclampsia, and with higher risks of offspring born large for gestational age (LGA) in mothers with gestational hypertension.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with PCOS are more likely to develop gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and chronic hypertension. Although adverse birth outcomes have been frequently reported in mothers with PCOS, such associations in the setting of a hypertensive disorder remain unknown.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a population-based cohort study including all live births 2004-2014 in Finland (n = 652 732). To ensure diagnosis specificity, mothers with diagnoses that could cause signs and symptoms resembling PCOS were excluded.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Maternal diagnoses of PCOS, gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, and pre-eclampsia were identified from the Finnish national registries. Generalized estimating equation and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CIs of preterm birth, very preterm birth, and offspring being small for gestational age (SGA) or LGA in hypertensive mothers with or without PCOS, using normotensive mothers without PCOS as reference.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 43 902 (6.7%) mothers with hypertensive disorders, 1709 (3.9%) had PCOS. Significant interactions were detected for PCOS with hypertension on preterm birth, very preterm birth, offspring born SGA and LGA (F-preterm = 504.1, P-interaction < 0.001; F-very preterm = 124.2, P-interaction < 0.001; F-SGA = 99.5, P-interaction < 0.001; F-LGA = 2.7, P-interaction = 0.012, respectively). Using mothers with no hypertensive disorder and no PCOS as reference, the risks of preterm and very preterm birth were overrepresented in non-PCOS mothers with chronic hypertension or pre-eclampsia. PCOS was associated with higher risks of preterm birth (aOR(PCOS) 4.02, 3.14-5.15 vs aOR(non-PCOS) 2.51, 2.32-2.71) in mothers with chronic hypertension, with significant interaction between the exposures (F = 32.7, P-interaction < 0.001). PCOS was also associated with a higher risk of preterm birth in singleton pregnancies of mothers with pre-eclampsia (aOR(PCOS) 7.33, 5.92-9.06 vs aOR(non-PCOS) 5.72, 5.43-6.03; F = 50.0, P-interaction < 0.001). Furthermore, the associations of PCOS comorbid with chronic hypertension or pre-eclampsia was detected also for spontaneous births. Moreover, the risk of offspring LGA was higher in mothers with PCOS and gestational hypertension although lower in those with gestational hypertension alone (aOR(PCOS) 2.04, 1.48-2.80 vs aOR(non-PCOS) 0.80, 0.72-0.89; F = 9.7, P-interaction = 0.002), whereas for offspring SGA, the risks were comparable between hypertensive mothers with and those without PCOS.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Information on medication treatment, gestational weeks of onset for pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, weight gain during pregnancy, and PCOS phenotypes were not available. All diagnoses were retrieved from registries, representing only those seeking medical care for their symptoms. The ICD-9 codes used to identify PCOS before year 1996 are known to underestimate the prevalence of PCOS, while the inclusion of anovulatory infertility as PCOS might introduce an over-representation bias, although PCOS constitutes 80% of anovulatory infertility. The risk of very preterm birth in relation to maternal PCOS and hypertensive disorders should be interpreted with caution owing to limited sample sizes. Multifetal pregnancies among maternal PCOS were too few for a subgroup analysis. Moreover, ART included IVF/ICSI only. Potential effects of other treatments, such as ovulation induction, were not examined.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: PCOS was associated with additional risks of preterm birth or offspring being LGA in hypertensive mothers, which varied between hypertension types. The exacerbated risks highlight consideration of PCOS in pregnancy counseling and management for women with hypertensive disorders.

AB  - Changes in primary emissions due to the COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe for the year 2020 have been estimated by considering fully open-access and near-real-time measured activity data from a wide range of information sources and with simple computational techniques. The estimates consist on a dataset of reduction factors that are both time-and country-dependent and provided for the following source categories: energy industry (power plants), manufacturing industry, road traffic, aviation, shipping and other stationary combustion activities such as residential and commercial-institutional activities. Inspired in other authors' estimates for COVID reductions, the advantage of this methodology is that there is no use of machine learning, making this procedure more accessible to the general scientific community. We have followed a fast methodology that takes advantage of observed relationships between variables (e.g. temperature and energy demand) without needing special algorithms for finding those relationships. The comparison of our estimates with others from other authors indicate a reasonable agreement and pointing out that emissions dropped by a 17% on average in Europe, with large differences between sectors of activities and spatial heterogeneity. The most affected sector was aviation, with a spatial-averaged variation of-63% in emissions since the implementation of first restrictions with respect business-as-usual values. 2020 emission changes with respect to business-as-usual values in countries ranges from a-13% in Norway and Poland to a more than-20% in several Mediterranean countries as well as the United Kingdom. Two main periods of emission reductions have been identified.

AB  - Over the last couple of decades, many peer-reviewed publications focused on the bioeconomy, which it is frequently argued to be a key part of the solution to global challenges (climate change, ecosystem degradation). This study investigates the scientific literature on forest bioeconomy by applying a social network analysis to the bibliometric science. The bibliometric network analysis was performed over the time-frame of 2003-2020 to provide an overview on the main aspects characterising the forest bioeconomy issue. The results show that 225 documents on forest bioeconomy were published by 567 organisations from 44 countries. Finland and Canada are the two most productive countries with 32.8% and 12.7% of forest bioeconomy documents respectively. The co-occurrence network map of the keywords shows that the forest bioeconomy is related to three main concepts: sustainable development, bioenergy production, climate change mitigation.

AB  - Consumption-based environmental indicators, also termed footprints, give a sense of society's progress towards sustainable consumption. Although they have been published for several decades, little is known about their use and influence in policymaking. From the wider body of research into the use and influence of sustainability indicators, we see evidence that sustainability indicators contribute to learning and conceptual thinking in policymaking. This paper explores whether this is also the case for footprint indicators, and how any conceptual thinking or learning might come about from their use. We investigate these questions, along with whether the use of footprint indicators affects wider social and organizational structures to prompt the desired move to sustainable consumption, and how, therefore, the value of indicators as learning instruments might be enhanced. The analysis draws on activity theory, focusing on expansive learning. It uses data from a series of interviews, focus groups and workshops with Swedish public officials at national, regional and local government levels.
   We find that footprint indicators helped officials to learn about the concept of sustainable consumption and push the agenda forward while awaiting clearer political targets and mandates. This was not, however, due to the indicators alone, but rather to the creative practices and agency of committed government officials. Meanwhile, the use of indicators often takes place through one-way communication activities aimed at changing the behaviour of other actors; there is less evidence of their use to support dialogue among diverse views and interests. We conclude that if the aim is to change practices toward sustainable consumption throughout society, then political executives must put the necessary institutions and authority in place alongside the indicators, to support public officials tasked with implementation. This must be linked to a deeper political debate about what the policy agenda entails.

AB  - Sallow (Salix caprea L.) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) constitute small proportions of the deciduous tree volume in Scandinavia, but are highly preferred winter forage for moose and red deer, which occur at historically high densities. Thus, a possible decline of these tree species has been indicated. Against this background, we have reviewed the life histories of relevance for browsing, as well as the basic biology and genetics of sallow and rowan. The species show similarities with respect to short lifespan, small size and sympodial growth pattern, which are risk factors in a browsing context. They also have high juvenile growth rate, important for growing quickly out of reach of browsers. Sallow depends strongly on disturbance for establishment and is more demanding with respect to soil and light conditions than rowan, possibly important for the substantially lower abundance of sallow on the Norwegian Forest Inventory plots. Similarly, the relative recruitment of small size classes of sallow is less than for rowan. Although recruitment is reported to be hampered in wintering areas with high moose or red deer densities, the inventory data, however, dating only back to 1994, do not suggest a general decrease in any of the species. Sallow and rowan saplings show low mortality in moose and deer dominated areas and the species can be characterised as rather resilient to browsing. Of more concern is that browsing can constrain the development of mature rowan and sallow trees locally, with possible consequences for associated epiphytic biodiversity.

AB  - Background & Aims In 2014, the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Sweden was evaluated, to establish a baseline and inform public health interventions. Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Sweden's progress towards the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. Methods The data used for modelling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios ('2019 Base' and 'WHO Targets') were developed to evaluate Sweden's progress towards HCV elimination. Results At the beginning of 2019, there were 29 700 (95% uncertainty interval: 19 300-33 700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment and liver-related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require (i) expanding harm reduction programmes to reach more than 90% of people who inject drugs (PWID) and (ii) treating 90% of HCV + PWID engaged in harm reduction programmes and >= 7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programmes, annually by 2025. Conclusions It is of utmost importance that Sweden, and all countries, find sustainability in HCV programmes by broadening the setting and base of providers to provide stability and continuity of care during turbulent times.

AB  - European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species for biodiversity in boreal forests. However, large aspen have largely been removed from managed forests, whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (>= 20 cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and managed forests in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11 400 ha, 36 000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots. The average volumes of mature living and dead aspen were 4.0 and 1.3 m(3)/ha in continuous old-growth forests and 0.2 and 0.6 m(3)/ha in managed forests, respectively. These results indicate that large aspen trees in managed forests are a legacy of the past, when forest landscapes were less intensively managed. We conclude that the long-term persistence of aspen in protected areas can only be secured by means of restoration measures that create gaps large enough for regeneration to occur. More emphasis should be given to sparing aspen during thinning and to retaining mature aspen during regeneration cutting in managed forests.

AB  - Deposition measurements were performed during one month in autumn 1992 in a rural place on the west coast of Sweden, Airborne particle concentrations and deposition fluxes were measured simultaneously.
   Aerosol sampling was made with a dichotomous virtual impactor which size segregated the particles into fine (< 2.5 mu m) and coarse particles (2.5-10 mu m). The flux determination consisted in measuring the total (bulk) deposition, wet deposition and dry deposition to three surrogate surfaces. A modified Andersen deposition sampler was used to discriminate between the dry and the wet periods. The analytical techniques for element analysis were EDXRF, ICP/MS and ion chromatography. By correlation analysis of the airborne elemental concentrations in fine and coarse particles it was possible to identify sources of the encountered aerosol.
   The K/Cl Ca/Cl and Br/Cl ratios in coarse particles were very close to those in sea water, suggesting a predominantly marine source of coarse particle Cl, K, Ca, and Br. The highest correlations were obtained for coarse particle Br vs Cl (0.99) and for coarse particle K vs Ca (0.98). The Br/Pb ratio in fine particles, approaching the ''ethyl ratio'' in fresh car exhaust, indicated that traffic was the dominant source of the fine particle Br and Pb. The positive correlations between most of the metals in fine particles indicated long distance transport from industrial source regions in Europe.
   The measured dry and wet deposition fluxes are reported for S, Cl, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb, and estimates of annual total deposition at the measurement site are given and compared with reference data. The general feature is that fluxes are smaller in the northeast part of the North Sea compared to the southern part.
   Average dry deposition velocities obtained in the present study are compared with reference data and also with the elemental coarse/fine particle ratios. These ratios give a rough estimate of what deposition rate to expect. The fine particle elements having coarse/fine ratios less than one (V, Ni, Zn, Pb and S) have lower dry deposition velocities than coarse particle elements (Mn, Fe, Cu, Cl).

AB  - Effective prevention of criminal offences in passenger road transport includes the development and implementation of safer infrastructure and modern modification of the safety features of vehicles. It is important to adopt and enforce legal initiatives to reduce the main risks that entail serious traffic accidents. One of the main priorities of appropriate prevention is to improve legal education of the public. The aim of the article was to consider the current state of prevention of criminal offences in passenger road transport on the territory of Europe. Observation and comparative law were the main methodological tools. The conducted research showed that the EU states apply a variety of approaches to the prevention of criminal offences in automobile passenger transport, such as Vision Zero and the systemic approach Safe System with its Sustainable Safety sub-topic. The need to adopt the experience of Sweden and the Netherlands, which have achieved impressive road safety indicators, in Ukraine seems justified. The eCall traffic accident detection and prevention system and the ESRA innovative prevention method can be examples for implementation in Ukraine. Belgium's school education program Road Safety Weeks is aimed at minimizing teenage drunk driving, speeding, driver fatigue and distraction. The idea of the programme can be implemented into the relevant preventive activities in Ukraine. A promising vector of further scientific research will be a comparative analysis of the implementation of crime prevention on passenger road transport in the EU countries.

AB  - The biomanipulation of Lake Vesijarvi in southern Finland putatively changed the lake ecosystem resulting in a clear-water state, but the dynamics behind the observed change remained unverified. We used a general analytical approach to identify abrupt transitions in the long-term monitoring data of Lake Vesijarvi. Methods included the identification of breakpoints in chlorophyll a (response variable), in total phosphorus (TP; key driver) and in large-bodied cladocerans (feedback mechanism of biomanipulation). In addition, we characterised the frequency distribution and temporal variance of the response variable, as well as the interaction between TP and chlorophyll a. According to long-term records, biomanipulation resulted in two distinct states: (i) a eutrophic state, where chlorophyll a and TP were linearly correlated and (ii) a mesotrophic state, where the key driver and response variables were not significantly correlated. The changed relationship between the key driver and response variables, together with the increase in the body size of cladocerans, suggested a hysteresis-type transition phase. However, the frequency distribution and the temporal variance of chlorophyll a agreed also with a threshold-type of transition. Zooplankton seemed to be more important in maintaining the clear-water state than previously reported. Our results highlight the role of long-term monitoring data and the characterisation of abrupt transitions in ecosystem interactions as tools for sustainable management of lake ecosystems.

AB  - This study conducts an integrated energy system assessment to evaluate pathways for using locally distributed sustainable biomass resources in the conversion to renewable gas and liquid biofuels in future integrated energy systems. A modelling framework with a detailed spatiotemporal representation is used, optimising the usage and transportation of local biomass resources for producing renewable gas and renewable liquid fuels through the OptiFlow model, along with the comprehensive power and district heating model Balmorel, integrating shortterm dynamics in the long-term planning horizon. Results for a fossil-independent Danish energy system by 2050 show that production of bio-jet fuel in Denmark would impose high pressure on national biomass resources. Electrofuels, such as biomethanol, have economic viability and promising potentials. The results regarding renewable gas production show that anaerobic co-digestion of a mixed feedstock to produce biogas, which is further upgraded to biomethane using water scrubbing for CO2 removal, would be the preferred option. Biorefineries are located near larger cities to benefit from economy of scale and access to large district heating networks, as excess heat from biorefineries could supply up to 21% of the national district heating demand. On the contrary, biogas plants would be located in the countryside, as the costs of transporting manure are a determining factor. Therefore, our study provides a novel modelling approach, which enables optimisation of geographical distributed resources for renewable gas and liquid fuel production, while taking synergies across energy vectors in account.

AB  - The study focused on the evaluation of probable changes in the severity of sea ice conditions occurring in 3 selected areas of the Baltic Sea: the Gulf of Bothnia, Gulf of Finland and the Southern Baltic Sea up to the year 2100. The areas have been chosen due to the high intensity of marine traffic (the Gulfs-of Bothnia and of Finland) and due to differences in sea ice conditions; winters in the Gulf of Bothnia were characterized as the most severe, whereas in the Southern Baltic were classified as the mildest ones. Consequently, three scenarios were taken into account in the study: A2 (slow rate of global economic development, market scenario), A1B (regional scenario, rapid economic development, with ecological priorities), B1 (sustainable, median economic development with strong ecological priorities), all three constructed on the basis of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES models of greenhouse gas emission). The probable changes of sea ice conditions expressed as severity index S were calculated from these models. The main results of the investigation are as follows, the variety of sea ice conditions occurring in specific regions of the Baltic will remain stable (i.e. the most severe winter conditions will still occur in Gulf of Bothnia, while the mildest in the Southern Baltic Sea). The most significant changes are likely to occur in the Southern Baltic, where some winters without ice cover in the Vistula Lagoon may happen. Nonetheless, some extremely severe winters will occur and also within specific seasons more winters with a lower number of days with ice will occur.

AB  - Enhancing adaptation of forest ecosystems to prospective climate change is a major challenge in current forest management. Beyond potential negative effects of climate change such as decreasing productivity due to an increasing number of drought periods and damages from intensified disturbance regimes, there is also a potential for increasing productivity due to prolonged vegetation periods and higher photosynthetic rates. Quantitative genetic variation is crucial for adaptability of species towards environmental changes. The use of suitable reproductive material for forest regeneration will be a key factor essential for both, mitigating negative effects and making the most of potential positive effects. Therefore, insights into intraspecific variation within and among tree populations in climate response are of paramount importance.
   In our study we investigated intraspecific variation in climate response among Norway spruce (Picea abies) populations in the eastern Alpine range. Results from a comprehensive Austrian provenance test, comprising tree heights at age 15 from 379 populations planted at 29 test sites across Austria. were used to calibrate climate response functions for groups of Norway spruce populations. Potential future changes in productivity for climate change conditions as represented by a regionalized A1B scenario were estimated using height at age 15 as a productivity proxy. Climate response functions were calculated for single populations and aggregated clusters of populations from climatically similar origins.
   Our results hardly revealed any declines in employed proxies for productivity of Norway spruce throughout its current distribution range in Austria. For most parts of Austria an increase of tree heights up to 45 percent can be expected until 2080. However, the impact of a warming climate is different for individual population groups. Generally, variation in climate response increases with higher temperatures and less precipitation. Thus, an optimized choice of seed material according to prospective future climate conditions has the potential for an additional increase of productivity up to 11 percent.
   In general, populations from currently warm and drought prone areas seem to be well adapted to respective climate conditions and may be appropriate candidates for extended utilization in future. Furthermore, populations showing the best productivity indices originate from regions, which are phylogenetically distinct from the core distribution area of Norway spruce, suggesting that population history might explain part of the variation in climate response among populations.

AB  - Averting climate change-induced forest diebacks increasingly relies on tree species planted outside of their natural range and on the addition of non-native tree species to mixed-species forests. However, the consequences of such changes for associated biodiversity remain poorly understood, especially for the forest canopy as a largely understudied forest stratum. Here, we used flight interception traps and a metabarcoding approach to study the taxonomic and functional (trophic guilds) composition and taxon richness of canopy arthropods. We sampled 15 monospecific and mixed stands of native European beech, native Norway spruce-planted outside its natural range-and non-native Douglas fir in northwest Germany. We found that the diversity of arthropods was lower in non-native Douglas fir compared with native beech stands. Taxon richness of herbivores was reduced by both conifer species. Other functional guilds, however, were not affected by stand type. Arthropod composition differed strongly between native broadleaved beech and monospecific coniferous (native spruce or non-native Douglas fir) stands, with less pronounced differences between the native and non-native conifers. Beech-conifer mixtures consistently hosted intermediate arthropod diversity and community composition compared with the respective monospecific stands. Moreover, arthropod diversity had a positive relationship with the number of canopy microhabitats. Our study shows that considering arthropod taxa of multiple functional groups reveals the multifaceted impact of non-native tree species on forest canopy arthropod communities. Contrasting with previous studies that primarily focused on the forest floor, we found that native beech hosts a rich diversity of arthropods, compared with lower diversity and distinct communities in economically attractive, and especially in non-native, conifers with few canopy microhabitats. Broadleaf-conifer mixtures did not perform better than native beech stands, but mitigated the negative effects of conifers, making such mixtures a compromise to foster both forest-associated diversity and economic yield.

AB  - Rainfall, stemflow, and throughfall were collected from 1996 to 1999 at two types of forest sites: (1) forests near the traffic roads and urban areas and (2) forests away from the urban areas at Mt. Gokurakuji, Hiroshima, western Japan in order to estimate the effects of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric deposition. Rainfall deposition for major ions showed small differences between the sites. The NO3- and SO42- concentrations in stemflow were higher at the urban-facing slope than at the mountain-facing slope. Throughfall deposition of NO3- and SO42- was also higher at urban-facing slopes. Net throughfall (NTF) deposition (throughfall minus rainfall) of NO3- and SO42- accounted for 77 and 50% of the total throughfall deposition on urban-facing slopes, respectively, while it accounted for 44 and 23% on the mountain-facing slopes, respectively. These results indicated a higher contribution from dry deposition on urban-facing slopes compared to mountain-facing slopes. Atmospheric N (NO3- + NH4+) deposition from throughfall was estimated to be around 17-26 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) on urban-facing slopes, which was greater than the threshold of N deposition that could cause nitrogen leaching in Europe and the United States. The high load of atmospheric N deposition may be one of the factors bringing about the decline of pine forests on urban-facing slopes of Mt. Gokurakuji.

AB  - To counteract the shortage of nurses in the workforce, healthcare organizations must encourage experienced nurses to extend their working lives. Intensive care (IC) has higher nurse-to-patient ratios than other settings, which includes a particular susceptibility to staff shortage. This qualitative study investigated how older IC nurses experienced their working life and their reflections on the late-career and retirement. Semi-structured interviews with 12 IC nurses in Sweden (aged 55-65 years) were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. The results showed that nurses planned to continue working until the age of 65 and beyond. When reflecting on their late-career decisions, nurses considered nine areas covering individual, work, and organizational factors as being central to their ability and willingness to stay. Overall, the nurses had good health and were very satisfied and committed to their job and to the organization. They mentioned having both the job and personal resources required to cope with the physical and mental job demands, which were perceived as motivational challenges, rather than hinders. They also reflected on various human resource management practices that may promote aging-in-workplace. These findings may inform organizations aiming at providing adequate conditions for enabling healthy and sustainable working lives for IC nurses.

AB  - Climate change creates a big challenge for forest science. One of several problems calling for urgent solution concerns the elaboration of the scientific foundations for determination of the species composition of forest stands under changing environmental conditions. This problem is particularly acute in case of declining Norway spruce stands in the Sudety Mountains (SW Poland). The paper presents the main principles used to develop a model allowing determination of the most desirable species composition for any given forest stand occurring in the Sudety region. These principles include: 1) an assumption that a basis for species composition planning should be a forest site type, corrected by means of site index of the currently existing forest stand, 2) a supposition that one should broadly consider present processes taking place in Sudety stands, particularly, an intense forest dieback caused by recurring drought periods and strong winds, 3) a postulate that one should consider the differences between tree species in respect to their reaction to particular abiotic factors, 4) an assumption that majority of stands should consist of several different tree species, 5) an assumption that introducing on a wide scale Douglas fir, well-adapted to the conditions of the Sudety Mountains, is allowed, 6) an idea that one should take into account differentiated production potential and varied timber quality of particular tree species, 7) an assumption that one should consider the main features of topography (altitude, exposition, slope) as well as 8) fine elements of micro-topographical situation, as a basis for introduction of different tree species. The results obtained by means of the model based on the above mentioned principles are presented on the example of two forest districts: Ladek-Zdroj (fig. 4a, b) and Szklarska Poreba (fig. 5a, b). In both cases, a necessity to diminish the share of Norway spruce and to increase the share of such species like common beech, silver fir, Douglas fir and European larch is demonstrated. One may expect that projected compositions, taking into account the most appropriate tree species and their most suitable localizations, will allow establishment of forest stands which will be more resistant to drought and wind and, thus, will be more able to fulfill several important forest functions (related to water and soil protection, protection of forest biodiversity and timber production).

AB  - Background There is an international public health interest in sustainable environments that promote human wellbeing. An individual's bond to places, understood as place attachment (PA), is an important factor for quality of life (QoL). The material environment, such as access to nature (AtN), access to amenities (AtA), or noise, and the social environment, such as social support or loneliness, has the potential to influence PA. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between these factors and QoL. Methods The study relied on data from 28,047 adults from 30 municipalities in Southern Norway obtained from the Norwegian Counties Public Health Surveys in 2019. Latent regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between the material and social environmental factors and QoL, mediated by PA. Results We found a relationship between social and material environmental factors and PA. Higher AtN and AtA scores were related to an increase in PA, whereas higher perception of noise problems was related to decreased PA scores. When social environment factors were added to the model, they were even stronger predictors of PA and, in turn, QoL through mediated effects. We also found a strong positive association between PA and QoL (unstandardized beta = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.87-0.90, p < 0.001). The whole model explained 83% of the variance in PA and 65% of the variance in QoL. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggest the relevance of material and social environmental factors for PA and QoL. Therefore, research on public health and QoL should include place-sensitive variables.

AB  - Forest structure is the result of past disturbances, regeneration establishment, competition, and mortality dynamics. Natural disturbances can create single dead tree to larger canopy gaps creating both small and large scale patterns and processes. The analysis of forest spatial pattern can provide information on these dynamics shaping forest ecosystems. Knowledge about primeval forest dynamics is relevant for their conservation and is an important reference for delineating sustainable forest management.
   The main aim of this research was to assess forest structure and understand spatial patterns and related disturbance processes in a mixed silver fir-Norway spruce-beech old-growth forest. The study site is the forest reserve of Lom, an old-growth forest located in Bosnia and Erzegovina. We analysed forest structure at different scales and with different approaches : a) landscape, b) forest, and c) single tree.
   A Kompsat-2 satellite image was used for forest canopy gaps delineation (a). The classification was based on an artificial neural network and allowed the identification of 297 canopy gaps (50-1776 m(2)). The size and spatial pattern of the gaps were found to be different between core area and buffer zone.
   Forest structure (b) in the core area was analysed applying a 120 m grid sampling design (40 plots). From this preliminary analysis we identified a stand with typical old-growth characteristics in the central part of the core area and a 1 ha intensive sampling plot was established (c). Inside the plot all trees were mapped, measured, and a core extracted to assess tree age. Spatial structure was investigated by means of Point Pattern Analysis and LISA (Local Indices of Spatial Autocorrelation). The three scales and approaches produced consistent results. The landscape approach confirmed the hypothesis that small-scale processes predominate at Lom especially within the core area of the reserve.

AB  - Despite realization that climatic changes and extreme weather events are ravaging the agriculture sector, climate change adaptation by farmers is slow in Europe. There are few studies that have explored the capacity of farmers to adapt to a changing climate, especially in the Nordic countries. A mix-method design i.e. a combination of action research and explorative research approaches was adopted. Perceptions of farmers was elicited using a questionnaire survey, which achieved a 33% response rate (81 out of 243) and in total 51 interviews were conducted with various stakeholders. Data was analyzed using one sample- and two sample t-test and ANOVA in a commercial software GraphPad Prism. In the article, both climatic and non-climatic drivers, affecting perception of farmers to adopt climate smart agricultural practices are presented and various short- and long-term interventions made by farmers to cope with climate change impacts, along with their positive and negative outcomes are discussed. It is found that stakeholders have poor understanding of land and water resources carrying capacity, are influenced by "post exposure-let down" mindset and are skeptical to climate change. Moreover, two kinds of apparent stakeholder systems that give rise to "passive" or "active" farmers, i.e. a top-down control system, and a bottom-up facilitating support system, were identified. It is recommended for authorities to consider farmers' expectations and education levels while designing advisory training programs, to introduce innovative, incentive driven, support policies for farmers and to consider shifting the current subsidies system to an outcome-based one.

AB  - The purpose of environmental legislation in the EU is prevention, minimization, and utilization of waste, respectively. When utilization is not possible, the purpose becomes the safe landfill disposal of waste, or disposal by other ecologically beneficial methods. In addition, material efficiency is an essential topic nowadays to promote the sustainable use of natural resources, waste materials, and industrial by-products, in agreement with the principle of sustainable development and LCA. To promote these goals, a four-stage sequential leaching procedure and determination of total concentrations was used in this research to determine the distribution of Cu, Pb, Zn, and V samples taken from waste rock material, originating from a Finnish zinc mine, and used as railway ballast in Northern Finland. The leaching procedure consists of the following five sequential fractions: (i) an acidic water-soluble fraction (H2O, pH = 4), (ii) an exchangeable fraction (CH3COOH), (iii) an easily reduced fraction (NH2OH-HCl), and (iv) oxidizable fraction (H2O2 + CH3COONH4). The results show that conditions and the size of ballast have a significant effect on the solubility of all heavy metals, and therefore on their mobility, bioavailability, and environmental risk. In addition, the total concentration of every element is much larger than its solubility in each four fractions (i)-(iv) or the sum of these concentrations - this sum can be called by the potential bioavailability - because the highest concentration is in the residual fraction. The leachability results determined here for waste rocks utilized as railway ballast show in good agreement with all earlier investigations determined for other waste or industrial by-products. Sequential leaching studies provide valuable information about the effect of conditions on the leachability/solubility, mobility, and bioavailability for risk assessment of harmful heavy metals. This information is necessary if we want to know the real environmental risk of metals in different conditions, possible in natural conditions now and in the future, i.e. not only in terms of the conditions pertaining to permission applications.

AB  - The relationship between urbanization, energy use, and CO2 emissions has been extensively studied in recent years, however little attention paid to the differences in urban forms. Previous studies implicitly assume that the urban form is homogenous across different urban areas. Such an assumption is questionable as urban form can have many different facets. This paper investigates the effects of urbanization on the road transport energy use by considering different urban forms from a dataset of 386 Norwegian municipalities from 2006 to 2009. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model with an energy use identity equation, the main findings (1) confirm the well-established result that urban density has a negative and significant influence on road transport energy use, and (2) demonstrate that the effect of urbanization partly depends on the level of urban density. These results imply that additional increases in urbanization in dense areas yield greater decreases in road transport energy use per capita. Additional findings posit that (3) there is a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between road energy use per capita and urban population. This implies that an increase in total municipality population over a specific turning point can result in a decrease in road energy use per capita. However, (4) the ratio of urban residential buildings with private gardens has a negative and significant influence on road transport energy use. This implies that there may be a trade-off between compact and sprawl city development strategies, highlighting that sustainable energy use requires further investigation.

AB  - Sustainable development is one of the key concepts in coastal management, and indicators are widely considered to be suitable communicative and easy-to-use tools in providing environmental information for management. However, the applicability of aggregate indicators still needs examination and discussion. In this study the Trophic Index TRIX was applied in the northern Baltic Sea, an environment different from where it has been elaborated (the NW Adriatic Sea). The results of TRIX were in accordance with the general classification scheme of Finnish coastal waters. The results indicate that TRIX, like other aggregate indicators, is site dependent and needs to be calibrated to the conditions of the area in question. TRIX can provide useful information for decision-making, but needs to be linked with other sources of information to draw a broader picture that is needed in adaptive management of coastal waters.

AB  - This article concerns the contested siting of a solar collector field in Torsng, Sweden, a designated area of national heritage. The contest is described as a 'planning drama' and a locally articulated controversy between two national policies and priorities: national heritage versus sustainable development. Two professional groups are at the centre of this drama: antiquarians at the County Administrative Board, and a group of employees at the municipally owned utility company. The article focuses in particular on the clash of two knowledge systems; how these are expressed, clarified and elaborated on when being confronted with one another in this specific situation. Temporal, horizontal and vertical scales are used to analyse the material. Contrary to what has previously been assumed to be the case for modern Western societies, the contested landscapes are shown to depend for their realization or destruction, not only on temporal and horizontal dimensions, but also on a vertical dimension including artefacts above and below the surface. The struggle to find a solution that everyone could agree on was not merely a matter of making two conflicting ways of perceiving this land come to terms. It was, in fact, an attempt to force two incommensurable landscapes into the same piece of land.

AB  - The tolerance of lynxes Lynx lynx to human presence and disturbance in a hunted population in Norway was studied using telemetry. Forest land within 200 metres from the nearest road or house was avoided by lynxes when resting (P < 0.01). The tolerance distance of resting lynxes towards intruding people was short (median 50 m), though strongly correlated with the horizontal vegetation cover (partial correlation, P < 0.02) and forest maturation stage (partial correlation, P < 0.02), but not with terrain inclination (partial correlation, P > 0.3). The lynxes did not enter steeper country (P > 0.4) or alter their daily walking distance (P > 0.7) after being disturbed. The data indicate that lynxes, even when suffering extensive, man-induced mortality, may tolerate high human activity within their range as long as sufficient stands of undisturbed, mature forest with dense horizontal cover are present.

AB  - This paper focuses on and analyses the potential hydrological impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regime of the Kelani River basin, Sri Lanka. In this research, future basin-wide hydrology is simulated by using downscaled temperature and precipitation outputs from the Canadian Earth System Model, version 2 (CanESM2), and the Hydrologic Engineering Centre's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). The research further evaluates the long-term behavior and trends of climate extremes based on observed historical temperature and precipitation data. The findings suggest that temperature and precipitation extremes are on the rise while the annual average precipitation in the basin is declining. It is also predicted with the application of statistical downscaling that temperature may rise annually for representative concentration pathways of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. A detailed modeling approach is applied to the Hanwella sub-watershed (1799.67km(2)) of the Kelani River basin to study subsequent water resource management options required to ensure the sustainable development alternatives with varying streamflow in the Kelani River basin under the effects of future (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) rainfall and temperature as impending climate change becomes manifested. This paper reviews the current state of the catchment as well as the suitability of applying GCMs rather than RCMs to Sri Lanka to assess this river basin, according to monthly, seasonal, and annual variations of the climatology. Further, a quantitative analysis of the change of amount of surface water in the selected river basin with respect to the expected variations in precipitation and temperature is also carried out. The findings of this research and overall outcome will be useful in identifying possible climate change impact on paddy and crop production, ensuing sustainable water management scenarios, best management options, and mitigation measures in land use, carbon emission management, etc., in a more meaningful manner in the future. This study will set the baseline for commencing and continuing quantitative studies incorporating the behavior of the basin-wide climatology and streamflow variability with the use of GCMs to achieve sustainable development goals.

AB  - Climate warming is affecting ecosystems worldwide, and slow-colonizing forest understorey species are particularly vulnerable if they are unable to track climate change. However, species' responses to climatic conditions in terms of growth, reproduction and colonization capacity may vary with the distance to their distribution range edge. Anemone nemorosa is known to be a slow colonizing forest herb dependent on forest cover in the southern and central part of its distribution range, whereas at its northern distribution range (and at higher elevations) it also occurs in open habitats. Here, we investigated the response of plant functional traits of Anemone nemorosa in central Norway (close to its northern distribution range edge) to a macroclimatic gradient (elevation), two microclimatic gradients (forest density and distance to forest edge) and a competition treatment (removal of neighbouring vegetation). We aimed to identify which environmental conditions (light, temperature, soil pH and/or soil organic matter) drive A. nemorosa's responses. In a total of 90 plots, we measured six functional traits of A. nemorosa (plant height, biomass, specific leaf area, seed number, seed mass,and germination percentage). We found stronger variation in environmental conditions along the macroclimatic elevational gradient, than along the microclimatic gradients of forest density and distance to forest edge, and this was also reflected in A. nemorosa's responses. Light availability, in interaction with temperature, was the key environmental variable driving plant performance, while soil conditions were less important. The competition release treatment had a negative effect on A. nemorosa in our study sites, indicating that the facilitative effect of the neighbouring vegetation may be stronger than the competitive effect. Our study suggests that A. nemorosa, close to its northern distribution range edge, has the capacity to cope with climate change through phenotypic responses, and that light and temperature are the key drivers of these responses.

AB  - Tree mortality is a complex process that exhibits great spatio-temporal variability. Long term mortality data is needed to understand this demographic parameter and how it is related to biotic, climatic, and anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we propose a Bayesian state-space model to estimate tree mortality time series in managed forests, where tree mortality is expressed as the annual proportion of the dead volume over the growing stock volume in a forest stand (subsequently, volume mortality rate). We argue that the volume mortality rate is an informative measure of tree mortality; and our simulations and field data suggests that the volume mortality rate is a good proxy of the demographic sense annual mortality rate (i.e. based on the number of trees), though the quality of the approximation depends on the particular management scheme. The proposed Bayesian state-space model combines two types of data: annual dead volumes from harvest reports and total growing stock volumes from periodic inventories. We illustrate the performance of the Bayesian state-space model using data simulated with an individual based and spatially explicit forest dynamic model (Samsara2). Then, we apply the Bayesian state-space model to field data from four forests in the French Alps and recover, unprecedented, century long, time series of annual volume mortality rate at the scale of a forest stand (10 ha) within each forest. We advocate the use of forest management data for future research, since temperate forests are managed in many countries since decades, thus many other unexploited data sets must exist.

AB  - The ongoing societal transformation triggered by the information and communication technologies revolution challenges many established forms of activity and tightens interconnections between activities. This historical transformation is a challenge for cultural-historical activity theory and highlights the importance of inter-activity connections. In this article, we claim that the key ideas of the theory that were first developed in the context of experimental psychology and education, namely the zone of proximal development, theoretical-genetic thinking, and formative intervention, should be extended and used in the analysis of developmental processes taking place "in the wild", focusing on how developmental challenges arise within one activity system and how potential tools are provided by another. In this context, supporting development calls for a chain of developmental interventions within an evolving inter-activity relationship. As an example, we analyze the co-development of the competence of an in-house developer and the work-development activity in a Finnish road-building company.

AB  - Given the limited resources available for conservation, it is important that the areas to preserve are selected in a cost effective manner. However, the cost effectiveness of the surrogate species strategy (the use of information on one or more species to identify areas of value for other species for which there is no, or more limited, available information) has seldom been evaluated.
   In this study, we investigate the opportunity cost of setting aside breeding sites of two forest raptor species (the surrogate species) by evaluating their individual and combined contribution to preserve diversity of polypores (wood-decaying fungi) and birds against the contributions of previously established nature reserves. We use numeric optimization models to compare different reserve selection strategies.
   Site selection based on nest sites of the dominant raptor species was more cost-effective than strategies using sites of the subordinate species or those processes previously used to select nature reserves in Finland. The inclusion of both raptor species in the reserve selection model further improved its performance relative to other approaches. This indicates that the means by which Finnish reserves are selected could be enhanced by including the breeding sites of these, and maybe other species, among the criteria used to select reserves in the future.
   These results show that information on charismatic and well-surveyed species could be a cost-efficient add-on to help enhance conservation endeavours. Where there is inter-specific competition for biodiverse sites, and using multiple species is costly, basing reserve selection primarily on breeding sites of a dominant species may be the best strategy. However, further work is required to establish the extent to which dominant species are typically better indicators of conservation relevance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the sorption behaviour of natural (N peat) and HCl-acid-modified peat (HCl peat) for contaminants in water collected at a mine site in northern Finland. Batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature and at 5 degrees C. Characterization of the sorbents by FTIR and XPS revealed no substantial change in the peat's functional groups due to the acid treatment. Generally, the N peat was a more efficient sorbent for the mine water, although the HCl peat exhibited better nickel uptake capacity (21 mg Ni/g) than the N peat (16 mg Ni/g) from synthetic water. This is attributed to the lower equilibrium pH in samples treated with the HCl peat as well as the water's different chemical composition. At room temperature, the N peat removed As(V) (80%) and Ni (85%) at low dosage (1-2 g/L), whereas the HCl peat presented good removal of As(V) (80%) at low dosage (1 g/L) but did not achieve satisfactory removal of Ni, even at a higher dosage (4 g/L). The performance of both sorbents was significantly affected by contact time. Ni removal by N peat increased substantially with contact time whereas removals achieved by HCl peat increased slightly up to 60 min, but decreased significantly at 24 h. Unlike with HCl peat, the N peat was less efficient in the experiments conducted at 5 degrees C. Overall, for both sorbents, As(V) and Ni were the most efficiently removed contaminants from the mine water. HCl peat had slightly better settling properties, however, both products settled poorly, thus rendering the studied mixing and settling system unsuitable for the proposed application. Nevertheless, both peat products, and especially the N peat, exhibited high contaminant removal potential and could represent a cost-effective and sustainable option for mine water treatment.

AB  - Waste management has developed in many countries and will continue to do so. Changes towards increased recovery of resources in order to meet climate targets and for society to transition to a circular economy are important driving forces. Scenarios are important tools for planning and assessing possible future developments and policies. This paper presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) model for environmental assessments of scenarios and waste management policy instruments. It is unique by including almost all waste flows in a country and also allow for including waste prevention. The results show that the environmental impacts from future waste management scenarios in Sweden can differ a lot. Waste management will continue to contribute with environmental benefits, but less so in the more sustainable future scenarios, since the surrounding energy and transportation systems will be less polluting and also because less waste will be produced. Valuation results indicate that climate change, human toxicity and resource depletion are the most important environmental impact categories for the Swedish waste management system. Emissions of fossil CO2 from waste incineration will continue to be a major source of environmental impacts in these scenarios. The model is used for analyzing environmental impacts of several policy instruments including weight based collection fee, incineration tax, a resource tax and inclusion of waste in a green electricity certification system. The effect of the studied policy instruments in isolation are in most cases limited, suggesting that stronger policy instruments as well as combinations are necessary to reach policy goals as set out in for example the EU action plan on circular economy.

AB  - This paper explores the author's experience of 'nomadic' organization [Deleuze, G., and F. Guattari. 1988. A Thousand Plateaus. London: Continuum] through the findings of an ethnographic study of an annual folk-culture community festival in a rural region of Sweden. The study concerned the practices of one small village community organizing group, of which the author was a member, in contributing to the festival. Using autoethnographic methods, the author brings together phenomenological theories of embodied knowledge [Merleau-Ponty, M. 1962. The Phenomenology of Perception. Abingon: Routledge; Kupers, W. 2011. "Dancing on the Limen - Embodied and Creative Inter-Places as Thresholds of Be(com)ing: Phenomenological Perspectives on Liminality and Transitional Spaces in Organisation and Leadership."

"On Organizational Becoming: Rethinking Organizational Change." Organization Science 13 (5): 567-582] to examine his experiences of nomadic 'journeying'. This highlights his movement in and through liminal spaces, both physical and metaphorical, as part of the research project, and his engagement with fellow participants in the co-construction of a place as part of the festival site organization. The impacts of these experiences on the author and their implications for the spatial relations of organizing are examined using fragments of reflexion, incorporating photographic and poetic elements.

AB  - Progress towards more sustainable societies requires moving from reactive responses to immediate problems, towards a more proactive focus on avoiding possible future problems and preparing for potential events. This requires that sustainability is endorsed by a group or opinion leader to be adopted by society. Organisations have been instrumental in fostering sustainability and can be such opinion leaders. During the last 10 years, there has been an increasing interest in organisational sustainability; however, research on civil society organisations (CSOs) has been scarce. Sports organisations (such as football clubs) are a particular type of CSO, and have been adopting sustainability, albeit slowly. Twelve interviews with representatives of Swedish football clubs (from which nine were male clubs and three were female clubs) were conducted between August and November 2021. The data were analysed using Grounded Theory's constant comparative analysis method. The findings show that football clubs have been undertaking several sustainability efforts (e.g. stakeholder collaboration, energy, health, gender and transportation) and have been connecting the sustainability dimensions throughout such efforts. The findings provide insights into the stages of sustainability awareness in football clubs, starting from the social dimension, then the environmental, economic and time dimensions. An important finding from the interviews was the potential that football clubs have in engaging and influencing society through their fans. This research provides insights into the contributions of football clubs to sustainability. Football clubs, and other CSOs, have the potential to become societal change agents and make societies more sustainable through a shared identity.

AB  - Due to the rising pressure from governmental regulations, the water recycling rate has increased significantly in mining operations over the last decades, resulting in a high variation of process water quality, which could potentially impact the plant performance. The current effort to assess water quality in mining is shifting from managing water to fulfill environmental regulations (focus on the effluents) to controlling water quality to maintain the operating performance (focus on the water within the process). However, minimal effort has been made to design a dedicated sampling procedure for process water. This study investigates the use of multivariate variography and principal component analysis (PCA) for improving the process water sampling procedure at the Kevitsa Mine, Finland. The aim is to design a sampling procedure for evaluating water quality using two different types of datasets and illustrating the impact of the dataset structure on the sampling design. The results showed that the common spot sampling procedure generated a very high sampling error and was not the best practice for process water. The weekly sampling frequency used at the mine site, suitable for fulfilling environmental regulations was too low to capture the process water variation. Therefore, it is not recommended to use environmental water datasets for operating control purposes. The multivariate variographic analysis revealed the hidden cyclic variation through its ability to summarize the time variations and the correlation between multiple variables that were not visible through the classical univariate variogram approach. However, the number of increments recommended by the global multivariogram became impractically high. Hence, an alternative approach combining PCA to the mutivariogram was used to filter noise from the data and keep the relevant information. This study highlights the benefits of using multivariate variography to improve water sampling procedures in the mining industry and to reduce both operational and environmental risks associated with water quality variability. Thus, this method has the potential to be used in worldwide mining operations as a standard procedure for sampling water to provide reliable results.

AB  - The article addresses the broader relationships between seaweed and algae as a marine resource, destination development, and sustainability. In many European countries, an industry around seaweed has emerged, ranging from high-end restaurants that provide their customers with local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients, to entrepreneurs offering "harvest your own seaweed"-tours. In this explorative study, we focus on different ways of experiencing this marine resource in a Swedish context, to better understand its economic and social potential. Taking a consumer perspective, we investigate through an online questionnaire and reviews from an online consumer-to-consumer travel-planning portal how seaweed and algae are validated. By exploring people's notions, the aim is to understand the potential and value of this marine resource better. Where is seaweed encountered and enjoyed? How is it used? What is experienced to be valuable about this resource? We identify possibilities for utilizing algae and seaweed in order to foster future business opportunities for local communities, as well as to integrate the resource more in our society. We show how algae and seaweed are experienced in diverse settings and dimensions, such as at home, while being a tourist, as part of everyday life, as a special treat, within nature, and as food.

AB  - We present evidence of a submerged early Holocene landscape off the Blekinge coastline in the Baltic Sea, dating to the Yoldia Sea and Initial Littorina Sea Stages when the water level was lower than at present. C-14 dated wood remains obtained by surveillance diving and new archaeological findings in combination with bathymetric analyses and interpolations between other sites across the Baltic Sea were used for refinement of the shoreline displacement history of the region. The new results reveal a Yoldia Sea lowstand level at 20 m b.s.l., a subsequent Ancylus Lake highstand at 3 m a.s.l., and then a period of relatively stable water level at about 4 m b.s.l. during the Initial Littorina Sea Stage, several metres lower than previously concluded. The refined shoreline displacement record was used for palaeo-reconstructions of the study area during four key periods, the Yoldia Sea lowstand phase, the Ancylus Lake transgression phase, the Ancylus Lake highstand phase and the Initial Littorina Sea lowstand phase, using elevation data and map algebra functions. A flow accumulation algorithm was used for reconstruction of the now submerged prehistoric river network in order to identify areas of high archaeological potential. Our revised shoreline displacement record, and especially its lowstand period during the Initial Littorina Sea Stage around 9500-8500 cal. a BP, raises future demands not only for specific archaeological shallow-water surveys down to 4 m b.s.l. in the area, but also for a renewed cultural heritage management strategy. The results of this study fill an important gap in the early Holocene part of the shoreline displacement history of Blekinge, contributing to its completion since the deglaciation, which is unique for the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The ectoparasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis has for decades plagued salmon aquaculture by decreasing profits and impacting wild salmon stocks. To protect migrating wild salmon stocks and avoid excessive cross-farm infections, authorities require treatments when sea lice level reach a given threshold. The treatment threshold is set to protect wild salmonid stocks but also to avoid costly lice infections on neighboring farms. Here we make a bioeconomic estimation of optimal treatment thresholds. We are particularly interested in identifying conflicts between the optimal threshold of the entire system of farms and for the individual farmer. We show that isolated individual farms can maximize profit by operating with a high threshold, while the maximum profit for an entire network of farms occurs with a threshold about 0.1 gravid female lice/salmon. These findings substantiate the Norwegian policy of lowering the lice treatment threshold below 0.5 gravid lice/salmon. The results also demonstrate that too low a treatment threshold results in high treatment rates. The difference between the optimal treatment strategy of individual farmers and that for the total system demonstrates that management of salmon lice infections operates in a tragedy-of-the-commons environment, where individual farmers may have an incentive to disregard legislation at the expense of the others in the network. This means that strong enforcement is needed to achieve optimal management of salmon lice infections.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change in geographically isolated, peripheral coastal communities holds particular challenges. In the CoastAdapt project a common approach was applied to support climate change adaptation in study sites in peripheral regions of Northwest Europe (Scotland, Ireland, Norway and Iceland). This involved a series of workshops at each site to describe the nature of future climate change, identify site-specific climate-change-related issues and explore adaptation options. While there are common issues related to the impacts of sea level rise, other aspects tend to be site and time-specific. The occurrence of recent high impact events (storms or floods), in particular, exert a strong influence on community perceptions. The studies reveal that availability of resources, knowledge of options (and their implications), and the particular governance framework in operation are major determinants of the adaptation options selected.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient emissions and associated eutrophication of urban lakes are a global problem. Future changes in temperature and precipitation may influence nutrient loadings in lake catchments. A coupling method, where the Generalized Watershed Loading Functions method was tested in combination with source quantification in a Substance Flow Analysis structure, was suggested to investigate diffuse nutrient sources and pathways and climate change effects on the loadings to streamflow in urban catchments. This method may, with an acceptable level of uncertainty, be applied to urban catchments for first-hand estimations of nutrient loadings in the projected future and to highlight the need for further study andmonitoring. Five lake catchments in Stockholm, Sweden (Racksta Trask, Judarn, Trekanten, Langsjon and Laduviken) were employed as case studies and potential climate change effects were explored by comparing loading scenarios in two periods (2000-2009 and 2021-2030). For the selected cases, the dominant diffuse sources of nutrients to urban streamflow were found to be background atmospheric concentration and vehicular traffic. The major pathways of the nitrogen loading were suggested to be from both developed areas and natural areas in the control period, while phosphorus was indicated to be largely transported through surface runoff from natural areas. Furthermore, for nitrogen, a modest redistribution of loadings from surface runoff and stormwater between seasons and an increase in the annual loading were suggested for the projected future climate scenarios as compared to the control period. The model was, due to poor monitoring data availability, only able to set an upper limit to nutrient transport by groundwater both in the control period and the future scenarios. However, for nitrogen, groundwater appeared to be the pathway most sensitive to climate change, with a considerable increase and seasonal redistribution of loadings. For phosphorus, loadings by different pathways were apparently less sensitive to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hematodinium is a type of parasitic dinoflagellate that infects marine crustaceans globally. The parasite lives mainly in the hemolymph or hemocoels of affected hosts, and results in mortalities due to malfunction or loss of functions of major organs. In recent years, the parasite had developed into an emerging epidemic pathogen not only affecting wild populations of economically valuable marine crustaceans in western countries but also the sustainable yield of aquaculture of major crabs in China. The epidemics of the parasitic diseases expanded recently in the coastal waters of China, and caused frequent outbreaks in aquaculture of major crab species, especially Portunus trituberculatus and Scylla paramamosain. In addition, the pathogen infected two species of co-cultured shrimps and multiple cohabitating wild crabs, implying it is a significant threat to the sustainable culture of commercially valuable marine crustaceans. In particular, the polyculture system that is widely used along the coast of China may facilitate the spread and transmission of the pathogen. Thus, to provide a better understanding of the biological and ecological characteristics of the parasitic dinoflagellate and highlight important directions for future research, we have reviewed the current knowledge on the taxonomy, life cycle, pathogenesis, transmission and epidemiology of Hematodinium spp. Moreover, ecological countermeasures have been proposed for the prevention and control of the emerging infectious disease.

AB  - Stand development after heavy diameter-limit cutting in spruce forests in southern Finland was addressed in this study. Tree diameter growth, regeneration and undergrowth, stand structure, and volume yield level were addressed with data from an experimental set of six stands. They were harvested once with a breast-height diameter limit of 21-23 cm and left to recover for 26-29 years until remeasured and studied. Spruce regeneration was abundantly present with an average of 5000 seedlings (height 3-129 cm) ha(-1). Additionally, there were some 500 saplings (diameter at breast height 0.14.0 cm) ha-1, which included both the regeneration established and developed after the harvest and included seedlings and saplings that were already present before the harvest. Trees in all size classes reacted to partial release with accelerating diameter increment without substantial lag. Trees with a high initial diameter had a consistently higher average growth rate than smaller trees. The stands had recovered quite well and evolved into fully stocked stands with a high number of trees in the lower canopy layers, implicating good prospects for the application of sustainable single tree selection. The average stand volume growth was 4.9 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), which was close to the level achieved in single tree selection with spruce in the area. Heavy diameter-limit cutting had not resulted in the depletion or destruction of stands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sweden's goals of contemporaneously reducing CO2 emissions and phasing out nuclear power will require a maximum utilization of biomass fuels. This would imply a significant shift from electricity and fuel oil to biomass generated heat, but must also be accomplished without a deterioration of the local air quality. The most suitable energy carrier seems to be pelletized biomass fuels with their associated low emissions and considerable residential conversion potential. Using an underlying statistical design, a parametric dispersion modeling study was performed to estimate and illustrate the combined effects of source-specific, meteorological and modeling variables on the ambient air quality in a typical residential area for different conversion scenarios. The work nicely illustrated the benefits of combining statistical designs with model calculations. It further showed that the concentration of combustion related ambient THC was strongly related to conditions affecting the source stength, but only weakly to the dispersion conditions and model variables. Time of year (summer or winter); specific emission performance; extent of conversion from electricity; conversion from wood log combustion; and specific efficiency of the pellet appliances showed significant effects in descending order. The effects of local settings and model variables were relatively small, making the results more generally applicable. To accomplish the desired conversion to renewable energy in an ecologically and sustainable way, the emissions would have to be reduced to a maximum advisable limit of 25 +/- 7 mg THC/MJ(fuel) (given as CH4). Further, the results showed the potential positive influence by conversion from wood log to low emission pellet combustion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Mixed Methods Approach to Exploring the Relationship between Norway Rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) Abundance and Features of the Urban Environment in an Inner-City Neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Urban rats (Rattus spp.) are among the most ubiquitous pest species in the world. Previous research has shown that rat abundance is largely determined by features of the environment; however, the specific urban environmental factors that influence rat population density within cities have yet to be clearly identified. Additionally, there are no well described tools or methodologies for conducting an in-depth evaluation of the relationship between urban rat abundance and the environment. In this study, we developed a systematic environmental observation tool using methods borrowed from the field of systematic social observation. This tool, which employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was then used to identify environmental factors associated with the relative abundance of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in an inner-city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada. Using a multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial model, we found that a variety of factors, including specific land use, building condition, and amount of refuse, were related to rat presence and abundance. Qualitative data largely supported and further clarified observed statistical relationships, but also identified conflicting and unique situations not easily captured through quantitative methods. Overall, the tool helped us to better understand the relationship between features of the urban environment and relative rat abundance within our study area and may useful for studying environmental determinants of zoonotic disease prevalence/distribution among urban rat populations in the future.

AB  - The interest in landrace cereals, i.e. genetically diverse varieties with historical origin, has increased in recent decades. While several studies exist on farmer's motivations to grow landraces in a Global South context, investigations are much less common in the Global North. Through an interview study with 32 Swedish farmers that cultivate landrace cereals on a commercial scale, farmers' motivations to grow landrace cereals were explored. The farms in the study ranged from medium sized to large. The majority were located in areas with marginal agricultural land and less fertile soil. All farms sold the landrace cereals at advantageous prices as niche products and all except one were certified organic. The farmers' motivations for growing landraces were grouped around three themes: i) sustainable farming systems; ii) suitable agronomic traits; and iii) economic incentives. The first and overarching theme was that cultivation of landrace cereals fitted well with the farmers' ideals on sustainable farming, with for example less intensive weed control and novel intercropping systems, as well as enabling production of wheat with baking quality on marginal agricultural land. Cultivation of landrace cereals was framed in contrast not only to conventional farming, but also to 'conventionalised' high input organic farming. The farmers regarded producing and marketing landrace cereals as an important foundation for more sustainable and multifunctional farming and food systems. This reflected the farmers' perception of a lack of modern varieties suited for these systems as well as the ability of landraces to buffer risks of crop failure on marginal land.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that spatial forest structure is a driving factor behind growth processes and that forest growth, in return, influences the structural composition of woodlands. Also any impact on forests is primarily a change of spatial forest structure. In the last few decades an impressive number of structural indices have been developed to quantify spatial forest structure and it has also been suggested that they can be used as surrogate measures for quantifying biodiversity [Pommerening, A., 2002. Approaches to quantifying forest structures. Forestry 75, 305-324]. Of particular interest in this regard is the development of a family of individual tree neighbourhood-based indices, which are measures of small-scale variations in tree positions, species and dimensions, developed by Gadow and Hui [Gadow, K.v., Hui, G., 2002. Characterising forest spatial structure and diversity. In: Bjoerk, L. (Ed.), Proceedings of the IUFRO International workshop 'Sustainable forestry in temperate regions', Lund, Sweden, pp 20-30]. Especially when expressed as frequency distributions these indices offer valuable information on spatial woodland structure. An important element of appraising the merits of such indices is a detailed evaluation of their performance for a specified purpose. One possible evaluation path is based on the idea that a successful quantification of spatial forest structure should allow the analysis to be reversed and enable the synthesis of forest structure from the indices derived. This idea is investigated here with a simulation model that uses the concept of cellular automata combined with further development of an approach by Lewandowski and Gadow [Lewandowski, A., Gadow, K.v., 1997. Ein heuristischer Ansatz zur Reproduktion von Waldbestanden (A heuristic method for reproducing forest stands). Allg. Forst- u. J.-Zeitung 168, 170-174]. The rules according to which the spatial pattern of tree positions "grows" in the stand matrix are deduced directly from the distributions of the structural indices of the input data. Different combinations of indices are used to assess and simulate the structure of four sample stands. The results show that simulations using species specific distributions of indices and a limit to the number of neighbours, used for index calculation to three or four neighbours are most successful at reconstructing the original stand structure. The specific sequence of simultaneous distributions of structural indices was not significantly superior to the use of marginal distributions. Contrary to the suggestion in Hui et al.

AB  - 1. Small populations of reward-producing plants are likely to be less attractive to animal pollinators than large populations. As a result, both the quantity and the proportion of compatible pollen deposited on receptive stigmas, and seed output per plant, may be lower in small than in large populations.
   2. We examined whether pollinator visitation, pollen deposition and seed set varied with population size in the self-incompatible, tristylous herb Lythrum salicaria, in the Skeppsvik archipelago, northern Sweden. We documented both the number of compatible and incompatible conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains received per flower, seed set and degree of pollen limitation of long-styled plants in 14 populations of different size in two consecutive years, and recorded the visitation rate to individual plants and the number of flowers visited per plant in eight of the populations.
   3. As predicted, the visitation rate tended to increase, while the number of flowers visited per plant tended to decrease with increasing population size. However, visitation rates were low overall and temporally highly variable, and these relationships only approached statistical significance. The proportion and absolute number of compatible pollen grains received increased with population size, while the total amounts of conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains received did not vary significantly with population size. The results of supplemental hand-pollinations indicated that the among-population variation in seed set was due to insufficient transfer of compatible pollen in small populations.
   4. Seed output increased with the receipt of compatible pollen grains up to about 200 compatible pollen grains received per flower. Between 73% and 98% of the L. salicaria pollen grains received were incompatible, and between 9% and 81% of the pollen grains deposited were heterospecific (population means). However, there was no evidence that the deposition of high numbers of incompatible conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains reduced seed set.
   5. In the study populations of L. salicaria, variation in seed output and pollen limitation are apparently governed primarily by factors influencing the transfer of compatible pollen. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in the efficiency of pollen transfer among compatible mating types may markedly reduce the reproductive output in small populations of self-incompatible plants. In light of the current rapid transformation and fragmentation of habitats, there is a pressing need both to clarify how the pollination success of plants with different pollination systems is affected by large-scale changes in population size, density and isolation, and to determine the demographic consequences of differences in pollination intensity.

AB  - Quantifying human impacts on the natural environment requires credible reconstructions of reference conditions. Anthropogenic acidification of surface waters is strongly influenced by total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations. Because both the degree of acidification and recovery are dependent on historical TOC concentrations, simple models to estimate changes in surface water TOC between reference conditions (1860) and the present day (2012) are needed. We used visible near infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) of lake sediments to reconstruct reference condition TOC and long-term monitoring data to predict recent changes. Two empirical models were developed to predict: (i) historical TOC trends between reference conditions (1860) and peak acidification (1980) and (ii) trends in TOC between 1988 and 2012. The models were statistically robust with adj. R(2) of (i) 0.85 and (ii) 0.71, respectively. Models were driven by lake and catchment area, wetlands, historical sulfur deposition and water chemistry. Present day TOC concentrations are similar to VNIRS-reconstructed and modeled reference condition TOC in Swedish lakes. The results are valuable for understanding drivers of TOC changes in lakes and for more credible assessments of reference conditions needed for water management in Europe and elsewhere.

AB  - Developing reliable methods for predicting advance of potentially harmful invaders in a novel environment remains a persistent challenge to epidemiological and ecological modelers. The dominating demographic approaches handle space only implicitly and the spatio-temporal variation in the resources for invaders growth, reproduction, and spread are widely missed.
   Here we introduce a geographic automata based spread model for Colorado Beetle that attempts to capture both the inter-seasonal variation in environment and the spread dynamics. Spread is modeled with active, wind-aided, and logistic-aided dispersals. With the model the resource base of the invader can be explored using the resource profiles of summers and winters, categorized by their temperature sums and regimes respectively. We use a case study of hypothetical aerial invasion of Colorado Beetle in Finland to demonstrate how the model can be used for exploration and prediction of invasion dynamics.
   The simulation model consists of a spatial seasonal resource array and of a spatial abundance level of beetles. During simulation several spatio-ecological metrics are updated. These metrics help the user to compare seasonal changes in location and area of invasion pattern, perforation rate of the pattern, and occurrence probabilities (OP) of the invading species. Occurrence probability gives an estimate of relative abundance of the invader in the situations where detailed individually based estimates are not feasible. Because an invader's impact is correlated with its abundance, a surrogate model is thereby generated by relating the invader's abundance to environmental variables and their inter-seasonal fluctuations. Hanski and Gilpin (1997; Hanski 1999) are in the same line finding that efforts to explain and predict occurrence patterns on the basis of species-specific resource requirements may have a high probability of success.
   Such a model, like the one we introduce here, could elucidate which part of the potential habitat will be most prone to permanent establishment of an invader. Lack of precision should not be a deterrent to developing predictive models where none exists. Crude predictions can be refined as additional data become available. Even though the problems of a priori modeling, such as validation and verification, do arise, in many cases it is the only approach we can use in order to get at least a glimpse to the future.
   These future events can be explored, for instance, by studying the differences in location, area, and perforation rate of the invasion pattern and by comparing occurrence probabilities of the species in multiple spatial and temporal scales in selected area. The user is also able to explore directional speeds with emerging primary and secondary progression zones for a selected area. The metrics aid the user in exploring the evolution of an invasion pattern at different scales and compare the regional differences in spreading rates between selected areas.
   Consequently, the aim of this study is to enter the field of a priori modeling and develop GIS-based software for exploration of the resource base of potential invader and for simulation of its potential spread in Finland. In addition our objectives are firstly to identify and rank the most risk prone areas where resource for growth, dispersal, and overwintering are most favorable from season to season. These are the areas where establishment of the beetle is most likely to happen if a mass migration takes place and the eradication measures fail. Secondly, our objective is to develop a model with which the resource base of the invader under current and future climates can be explored using the resource profiles of different temperature-categorized summers and winters at several scales. Thirdly, our objective is to provide the user with the metrics which would aid their exploration of the evolution of an invasion pattern at different scales and to compare the regional differences in spreading rates between selected areas.

AB  - Analyses of lifetime fitness in birds are typically based on estimates of breeding success, in particular the number of offspring fledged. Small and isolated bird populations often have a male-skewed adult sex ratio, so that male lifetime productivity depends to a large degree on pairing success, but few studies have focused on patterns of lifetime pairing success. The Norwegian population of Ortolan Buntings Emberiza hortulana is strongly male-skewed, such that in any year about half of all males are unpaired. Pairing success of first-year males (16-44%) was significantly lower than for older males (52-89%). Lifetime pairing success was correlated with lifespan and was strongly skewed, with a majority of males being paired only once or never, and only 11% paired three or more times despite a stable lifetime annual survival rate of 63%. Males that were paired in one year were more likely to be paired the next year than males that were unpaired in the previous year. The shortage of females caused even the older males to have a substantial probability of becoming unpaired, and 49% of long-lived males (known as adults for at least 4 years) were unpaired after years in which they were paired. Pairing success in the Ortolan Bunting therefore follows similar age-related and lifetime patterns in breeding success documented in other species. However, even the older males ran a high risk of not being paired, contrasting with earlier distinctions between pre-breeding and breeding lifespans. I discuss the importance of knowledge of pairing success for the management of endangered and declining populations.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to assess and compare EU countries in terms of the use of renewable energy sources in road transport. The following research tasks were undertaken to realize this aim: (1) a review of the literature concerning the negative externalities in road transport, the concept of sustainable development, and legal regulations referring to the utilization of renewable energy sources; (2) presentation of changes in energy consumption (both traditional and renewable) in road transport in EU countries in the years 2008-2019; and (3) identification of leaders among the EU countries in terms of consumption of renewable energy sources in road transport. The aim and tasks were realized using the literature review and TOPSIS method as well as descriptive, tabular, and graphic methods. The analysis was conducted for 28 EU countries according to the status for 2019. The period of 2008-2019 was investigated. Sources of materials included literature on the subject and Eurostat data. Although renewable energy sources accounted for as little as 6% of total energy consumption in road transport in EU countries in 2019, this is a significant topical issue. It results from the direction in which changes need to be implemented in terms of energy generation in this area of human activity. It turned out that blended biodiesel and blended biogasoline were the most commonly used fuels originating from renewable sources. The application of the TOPSIS method resulted in the identification of five groups of EU member countries, which differed in terms of the degree of utilization of renewable energy sources in road transport. Luxemburg, Sweden, and Austria were leaders in this respect. In turn, Malta, Estonia, and Croatia were characterized by very low consumption of renewable energy. The greatest progress in the utilization of renewable energy sources in road transport was recorded in Sweden, Finland, and Bulgaria (changes in the relative closeness to the ideal solution from 0.15 to 0.27), while the greatest reduction in relation to other countries was observed in Austria, Germany, and Lithuania (changes from -0.35 to -0.22).

AB  - Stumps of conifer trees are a prospective source of bioenergy and stump harvesting is a novel practice in forestry management in the Baltic and Nordic countries. However, as stump harvesting may cause possible environmental risks there has emerged a clear need for research focusing on sustainable forest management.
   Three Norway spruce (Picea abies) clear-cut areas on different soils in Estonia were selected for the present study. We analysed the effect of stump harvesting on net nitrogen mineralization (NNM) and on nutrient leaching. On dry and sandy Endogleyic Arenosol (Oxalis site type), stump harvesting reduced the annul NNM flux significantly; 134 and 202 kg N ha yr(-1) at the harvested and at the control site, respectively. In clear-cut area where Endogleyic Cambisol was dominating (Hepatica site type), stump harvesting had no effect on NNM (92 vs 88 kg N ha yr(-1)). However, in a clear-cut area where the soil type was Endogleyic Albic Podzol (Myrtillys site type), stump harvesting increased the total annual NNM flux: 102 vs 70 kg N ha yr(-1) at the harvested and at the control site, respectively. Stump harvesting affected also the proportion of nitrification and ammonification processes in NNM. At the Myrtillys site type stump harvesting increased the annual nitrogen (N) leaching flux. One year after stump harvesting, leaching at the harvested site was 11.7 vs 4.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at the control site. In the second year N leaching decreased and the difference levelled off. Increased N leaching was induced by a larger amount of water; average N concentration of the harvested and control sites did not differ. Although at the Oxalis site N leaching was larger at the harvested than at the control site, the total annual leached N flux was small (similar to 2 kg N ha(-1)). At the fertile Hepatica site type treatment had no impact on N leaching, which was only ca 1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Phosphorus (P) leaching was very small in all study areas, being below 0.1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1).
   The effect of stump harvesting on annual NNM as well as on N leaching was soil specific and highly variable. Stump harvesting affected also the proportion of the nitrification and ammonification processes in total NNM. Considering the first short-term results obtained from different site types, we can conclude that harvesting of spruce stumps does not induce serious environmental hazards in relation of N cycling.

CP  - 5th International Conference on Greenshouse Gas Control Technologies
AB  - The present study investigates the possibility for the Swedish forest industry to be a supplier of biomass for cogeneration of methanol, power and heat. Simulations have been performed in ASPEN PLUS(TM) to study the potential of different ways of using biomass from the pulp mills to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions. The biomass consists of waste wood, precipitated lignin and black liquor. Two different cases are estimated: case 1, where the pulp mill has a traditional recovery system, and the feedstock to the methanol plant constitutes of waste wood and some ligning precipitated from the black liquor; and case 2, where a new recovery system called black liquor gasification is introduced into the pulp mill. Case 2 permits a more flexible energy recovery and the available biomass increases. from 65 MW to 487 MW. In both cases, the process steam demand of the reference pulp mill will be fulfilled, and no fossil fuels are used in the mill.
   The methanol is further studied as an environmentally sustainable transportation fuel to replace gasoline. In case 1, with the lower amount of biomass used for methanol production, implementing the technology in all the Swedish chemical pulp mills results in a decrease of the carbon dioxide emissions by 465,000 t/y(1) when replacing gasoline with methanol. This figure corresponds to 4 % of the carbon dioxide emissions from the Swedish vehicles. In case 2, where a new technology is introduced, the same figures amounts to 1,932,000 t/y and 16 %, respectively.

AB  - This article examines the dynamics of knowledge in the valorisation of local food, drawing on the results from the CORASON project (A 'cognitive approach to rural sustainable development the dynamics of expert and lay knowledge'). It is based on the analysis of several in-depth case studies on food relocalisation carried out in 10 European countries (Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Poland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece). In the different fields of rural studies (rural sociology, geography, anthropology) there is currently a wide debate about the relocalisation of food production and consumption. Born out of a critique of the 'conventionalisation' of organic agriculture, attention to local food has grown in recent years to assume the features of a new orthodoxy or paradigm that is now undergoing, as is suitable to any orthodoxy, deep and critical scrutiny. Many points are discussed, from the definition of 'local' to its transformative role in the current agri-food system and rural community, whether relocalisation of food is a sustainable strategy and whether its character is radical or merely reformist. The perspective adopted here, which is relatively neglected in the literature, derives from the overall focus of CORASON on the role of knowledge in rural development. We look at the valorisation of local food as a knowledge-based practice that mobilises the various forms of knowledge embodied in both rural and non-rural actors. Following knowledge in the valorisation of food leads us to differentiate between patterns of food relocalisation across Europe and to analyse the interplay among knowledge forms and actors in the contested construction of the local food project.

AB  - A cluster analysis algorithm was applied to reduce the amount and complexity of 30 min aerosol number size distributions in a three year data set (2006-2008) at a urban background station in Helsinki, Finland. Only after objective validity tests to determine the appropriate number of clusters, a k-means cluster algorithm was applied to extract seven characteristic size distributions from the data set. The average total number concentrations of the clustered size distributions range from 6067 cm(-3) to 12,818 cm(-3) with modal diameters between 5 and 193 nm. The clustered size distributions were analyzed in terms of their physical properties (shape, log-normal modes, mode diameter), temporal occurrence (e.g. time of day, season) and their relation to local meteorology.
   Three different types of cluster distributions being represented by either three or two log-normal modes (in only one case) were characterized at the site: four clusters that were indicative for urban-type size distributions with different influence of anthropogenic and traffic activities occurring 69% of the study time, two maritime-type distributions (29% occurrence) and one nucleation-type size distribution (2% occurrence). We were able to relate the clusters to characteristic modal diameters, different temporal occurrence on the daily and annual cycle, e.g. urban clusters that occurred year round and those that were attributed to winter daytime situations specifically. Analysis of the daily patterns clearly reveals the influence of local traffic activity on three of the four urban-type cluster size distributions. The method offers the chance for a simple kind of source apportionment by establishing signature size distributions based on the physical properties of the aerosol size spectra.

AB  - Much research within risk has investigated risk perception and how risk behaviour is understood by the public. One goal of risk research is to understand how people perceive and interpret risk to facilitate safe behaviour. This is seen as important for many different reasons, one being because policy measures might be more effective when they address and understand individual differences in beliefs and perceptions of a target group (Steg, L., Sievers, I., 2000. Cultural theory and individual perceptions of environmental risks. Environment and Behavior 32 (2), 250-269). The main aim of this study was to investigate what is most important in regard to safety priorities. Three personality assets - anxiety, excitement-seeking and trust - were first examined. Further factors were driver optimism, worrying about transport risks, willingness to pay to increase safety, and negative attitudes toward traffic rules (as a driver). The results are based upon two questionnaire surveys carried out among a representative sample of the Norwegian public in 2004. The results showed that worry was the most important predictor of safety priorities. In addition, negative attitudes towards rules were also found to have an impact on priority. The proposed model explained 44% of the variance of safety priority. This knowledge gives additional information to improve the success of interventions because it will develop the ability to target those who consider safety to be of low priority and guide them to modify their attitudes. This may in turn increase their value of safety. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parasitic dinoflagellates of the genus Hematodinium are known to infect various marine crustaceans worldwide, especially crabs and several species of shrimp and lobster. Some of these species are new host species and components of commercial fishery products. These parasitic species are predominantly found in the hemolymph of the host and cause pathological changes and functional damage to organs and tissues, leading to death. In recent years, these parasites have infected important commercially valuable species, particularly in European waters, US waters, Australian waters, and recently in Shandong Peninsula in China. These Hematodinium pathogens were also reported to affect wild shrimp in Chinese waters and in the English North Sea. These rapid spreads affect crustacean aquaculture industries, where they are indeed a significant threat to the sustainability of the aquaculture of important crustaceans. The fishery products industries are also under pressure from the invasion of this pathogen, as the crab meat produced has a bitter taste, which may reduce its marketability. In response to these threats, this review was aimed at providing a broader understanding of the development of parasite distribution and ecological aspects of Hematodinium. In addition, the interaction of these pathogens with their hosts, the environmental drivers of Hematodinium disease, and future research perspectives were discussed.

AB  - Land use and development has a pivotal role in building sustainable future societies. Municipalities contribute to this effort by applying a set of land policy instruments to advance their selected policy objectives. The way in which a municipality chooses to activate these instruments is called a land policy strategy. The literature recognizes the diversity of land policy strategies within a single-country context, but as yet there has been no systematic and comprehensive examination of land policy practices to find out to what extent and how the municipalities' approaches to land policy differ from each other. To address this gap, this study examines the diversity of land policy strategies in Finnish municipalities by constructing an empirically grounded typology of municipalities' current strategies. Drawing on an extensive set of data on land policy practices in the 30 most populated Finnish municipalities, we identify five strategy types: land banking based active land policy, growth-oriented active land policy, regional vitality driven land policy, housing policy-oriented land policy and private development focused land policy. The strategy types are characterized by differences along six dimensions, namely land policy objectives, public land acquisition, public-private cooperation, public land allocations, economic incentives, and information steering and facilitation. The typology contributes to a deeper understanding of the variation and commonality in land policy strategies of local government authorities. Our findings support the view that current definitions of land policy strategies are too vague and ambiguous to portray the differences in strategies when the analytical focus is on municipality-level strategies.

AB  - Promotion of the circular economy (CE) has become one of the key policy objectives in the EU in the late 2010s. The power of the concept lies in the promise of decoupling economic growth from the increasing usage of virgin resources by closing the material loops. In this article, we investigate the material politics of the CE by means of an in-depth case study of how one pioneering biogas company in Finland struggled to undo a disruptive regional manure surplus by turning it into a resource in energy and fertilizer production. We treat this novel nutrient recycling business model as a political technology that aimed to rearrange existing metabolic relations in order to solve the problem of intensive pig farming that generated too much manure for sustainable utilization in the area. At the same time, their business model clashed with the various categorizations and technologies of governance that stabilized the status quo. These clashes embody the underlying societal tensions of the CE transition, which do not manifest themselves as open conflicts in public arenas. We claim that these obstacles point to challenges of unmaking material surplus with CE business models when the surrounding economy leans on a linear material flows and keeps growth on track.

AB  - Population viability analyses (PVAs) are based on basic demographic parameters such as breeding success, juvenile and adult survival. However, no PVAs have included the operational sex ratio (OSR). The Norwegian population of ortolan buntings (Emberiza hortulana) is characterized by a strongly skewed OSR (almost half of all males are unpaired). We assessed the effect of a skewed CSR on annual growth rate (2). Based on empirical data the deterministic growth rate was negative (lambda = 0.82), and mean time to extinction was 21.8 years. Model parameters had to be increased substantially compared to the empirical mean values to achieve lambda = 1.0 (clutch size from 4.25 to 8.06, juvenile survival from 17.6% to 33.5%, adult survival from 62.9% to 80.8%, and proportion of males breeding from 52.4% to 99.8%). Using low, mean and high empirical parameter estimates, we examined 36 scenarios for population development. only five resulted in values exceeding) = 1.0, of which four required an OSR of 1:1. Correlations between inter-annual population change and demographic parameters indicated that the proportion of males breeding matched the observed population trend best. Because breeding success, juvenile and adult survival were within the normal range seen among other bird species of similar body size, we suggest that the skewed OSR is the major factor limiting population growth. Skewed OSRs may be particularly common in small and isolated bird populations, because of female-biased natal dispersal, and should therefore be considered in all PVAs of endangered bird species.

AB  - In this manuscript we evaluate the potential of photovoltaic systems to meet some dedicated energy demand in specific geographic locations. Our approach is based on location-specific constraints rather than on pre-established, location-independent methodologies or assumptions. First, we propose that a thorough analysis of the socio-economic and technical possibilities of a location must act as the guide to optimize the deployment of renewables. This requires detailed knowledge of the area. Second, we propose that optimizing the exploitation of renewables by focusing on a particular location can also lead to successful outcomes with global impact. With this in mind we focus our attention on the Arctic region, known for its highly seasonal solar availability, and the challenge posed by increasing cruise ship tourism and corresponding air pollution. Our study targets Tromso city, Norway, and we show that solar energy generation could be a strong contribution for charging cruise ships in the summer with no need for generation and transmission investments. Our study opens the door to shifting to a location specific paradigm to seek sustainable energy solutions with the possibility to have a global impact. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Design of attractive services for the bus travel context is important because of the aim to increase the usage of sustainable travel modes of public transportation. In bus travel, both user experience of the digital services and the broader service design context of the public transportation need to be addressed. Experience-Driven Design (EDD) can be used to take the passengers' needs and experiences in the core of the design process. This paper presents a qualitative diary and interview study on bus travel experience with 20 passengers in two major cities in Finland. The aim of this study was to identify and communicate frequent bus passengers' needs, experiences, values and activities as user insights to support experience-driven service design in the public transportation context. Based on the data analysis, we derived ten Travel Mindsets: Abstracted, Efficient, Enjoyer, In-control, Isolation, Observer, Off-line, Relaxed, Sensitive, and Social. To communicate the study findings on bus passengers' travel experience, Travel Experience Personas were created. The personas include primary and secondary travel mindsets, specific needs related to bus travel, insights on mobile device usage, and target user experience (UX) goals that could enhance the personas' travel experience. We also discuss how the personas can be used as a communicative design tool that supports EDD of novel services in the bus context.

TI  - Building Mounds. Longhouses, Coastal Mounds and Cultural Connections: Norway and the Northern Isles, c AD 800-1200
T2  - MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - WHY WERE important Viking longhouses built on large mounds of sand and then repeatedly rebuilt in precisely the same apparently challenging location? Generations of Viking-late Norse people did so, on sandy bays along the coasts of the Northern Isles of the United Kingdom. These prominent, 'layered-up' longhouse complexes were landscape statements. They reflected, in their location and the detail of their construction and use, the social attitudes and arrangements of those who lived in and visited them. The settlements played a pivotal role in power relationships and in the organisation of the local economy. This article explores the meaning of these focal settlement mounds through landscape archaeology; investigates building practices, stratigraphic detail and place-name associations; looks at their cultural roots in Scandinavia; and considers the role they played in the development of local social and political structures in Orkney.

AB  - Knowledge about how weather conditions affect travel behavior in different user groups and contexts is relevant for planners and policymakers to facilitate sustainable transportation systems. We aimed to assess the influence of day-to-day weather on cycling for transportation among parents of young children with access to different bike types (e-bike vs non e-bike) in a natural study setting over nine months. We hypothesized less impact of weather variability on cycling when using an e-bike compared with a non e-bike. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Southern Norway. The intervention group (n = 18) was in random order equipped with an e-bike with trailer for child transportation (n = 6), a cargo (longtail) bike (n = 6) and a traditional bike with trailer (n = 6), each for three months. These 18 participants reported cycling on 832 out of 3276 person-days (25%). We used dynamic structural equation modeling for intensive longitudinal data to examine the relations between daily weather conditions, bike type (e-bike vs traditional bike), and cycling (dichotomized daily at yes or no). Air temperature (positively) and wind speed (negatively) were both credible predictors of cycling, whereas the other predictors (precipitation in the morning (yes or no) and presence of snow (yes or no) were not. We added interaction terms between bike type and weather conditions, but none of the interaction terms had a credible effect on cycling. Thus, the relations between weather conditions and cycling were not moderated by bike type among parents of young children.

AB  - An expanding body of research indicates that exposure to contaminants may impact marine mammal health, thus possibly contributing to population declines. The harbor seal population of the San Francisco Bay (SFB), California, has suffered habitat loss and degradation, including decades of environmental contamination. To explore the possibility of contaminant-induced health alterations in this population, blood levels of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were quantified in free-ranging seals; relationships between contaminant exposure and several key hematological parameters were examined; and PCB levels in the present study were compared with levels determined in SFB seals a decade earlier. PCB residues in harbor seal blood decreased during the past decade, but remained at levels great enough that adverse reproductive and immunological effects might be expected. Main results included a positive association between leukocyte counts and PBDEs, PCBs, and DDE in seals, and an inverse relationship between red blood cell count and PBDEs. Although not necessarily pathologic, these responses may serve as sentinel indications of contaminant-induced alterations in harbor seals of SFB, which, in individuals with relatively high contaminant burdens, might include increased rates of infection and anemia.

AB  - Premise of the Study: Seed banks may increase the effective population size (N-e) of plants as a result of elevated coalescence times for alleles residing in the populations. This has been empirically demonstrated in populations of the annual Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas comparable data for perennial species are currently lacking. We studied the contribution of seed banks to effective sizes of natural populations of the self-incompatible, perennial Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea, a close relative of A. thaliana.
   Methods: Fourteen populations of A. lyrata collected throughout the Norwegian distribution range were analyzed using micro-satellite markers.
   Key Results: The genetic composition of seed-bank and aboveground cohorts was found to be highly similar, with little genetic differentiation between cohorts in most populations. However, the proportion of private alleles was higher in aboveground than in seed-bank cohorts. The presence of seed banks significantly increased total N-e, but the contribution from seed banks to overall N-e were lower than the contribution from aboveground cohorts in most populations. Estimated historical N-e values, reflecting the effective sizes of populations throughout the history of the species, were considerably higher than estimates of contemporary N-e, reflecting number of reproducing individuals within the past few generations.
   Conclusions: The results show that the seed bank contributes to total N-e in the perennial herb A. lyrata. However, the contribution is similar to or lower than that of the above-ground fraction of the population and markedly weaker than that previously documented in the annual A. thaliana.

AB  - Identifying high-grade valuable wood resources by the visible individual traits of trees is a challenge for foresters and a requirement for sustainable resource management. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant phenotypic descriptors of the acoustic quality of Norway spruce standing timber. Two highly valuable Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands located in the Romanian Carpathians were selected for this purpose. A total of 27 tree, bole, bark, and crown variables and nine variables related to wood structure were statistically checked against the velocities of stress waves measured on standing trees at breast height, and the derived parameters: the radiation, the impedance, and the moduli of elasticity inLandRdirections. Principal component analysis was used for exploratory data analysis as well as mixed linear models were involved in explaining these acoustics. There were consistent variations in the measured acoustics from tree to tree, according to the age and social class. Wood acoustical parameters measured in theRdirection are better predicted by tree phenotype than the acoustical parameters measured in theLdirection. Bark thickness and branch width were the best predictors, while tree ring features were less predictive. At a given age, trees with high velocity had thinner and reddisher bark, thinner branches, and a narrower crown. Trees with high velocity anisotropy had narrower branches and wider sapwood. Furthermore, the phenotypic traits used had a poor explanatory power of the radiation ratio. In conclusion, spruce standing trees from the studied area bring forward certain outside features that enable us the multitrait identification of highly valuable wood for string instruments.

AB  - Background: The present study aims to increase bicycling and level of physical activity (PA), and thereby promote health in parents of toddlers, by giving access to different bicycle types. There is a need for greater understanding of e-bikes and their role in the transportation network, and further effects on PA levels and health. Moreover, longtail bikes could meet certain practical needs not fulfilled by e-bikes or traditional bikes, hence increased knowledge regarding their feasibility should be obtained. No previous studies have investigated whether providing an e-bike or a longtail bike over an extended period in a sample of parents of toddlers influence objectively assessed amount of bicycling and total PA level, transportation habits, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and blood pressure.
   Methods: A randomized cross-over trial will be performed, entailing that participants in the intervention group (n = 18) complete the following intervention arms in random order: (i) three months access to an e-bicycle with trailer for child transportation (n = 6), (ii) three months access to a longtail bicycle (n = 6), and (iii) three months access to a regular bicycle with trailer (n = 6), in total nine months. Also, a control group (n = 18) maintaining usual transportation and PA habits will be included. A convenience sample consisting of 36 parents of toddlers residing in Kristians and municipality, Southern Norway, will be recruited. Total amount of bicycling (distance and time), total level of PA, and transportation habits will be measured at baseline and in connection to each intervention arm. Cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and blood pressure will be measured at baseline and post-intervention. Main outcome will be bicycling distance and time spent cycling.
   Discussion: New knowledge relevant for the timely issues of public health and environmental sustainability will be provided among parents of toddlers, representing a target group of greatest importance. There is a call for research on the influence of e-bikes and longtail bikes on travel behavior and PA levels, and whether voluntary cycling could improve health. If the present study reveals promising results, it should be replicated in larger and more representative samples. Eventually, inclusion in national public health policies should be considered.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine citizens' perceptions of their preferred pro-environmental lifestyle choices in the future. We examined how these choices relate to different socio-demographic factors and moral foundations in a Finnish population survey sample (N = 1,020). Consistent with previous research, endorsing care and fairness foundations related positively to using plant-based food and local and natural food, as well as using sustainable energy, materials, housing and transportation solutions. However, also endorsing binding moral foundations, loyalty, authority and sanctity, related positively to using local and natural food and to using an electric car or biofuels. Most pro-environmental practices were related to being a woman, younger age and having higher education, but preferred choices differed according to living environment (urban or rural). We conclude that different pro-environmental choices are appealing to different socio-demographic groups with different moral views. Promoting different ways of contributing to ecologically sustainable future could be a way to reach different societal groups. In addition, re-framing more sustainable practices, such as plant-based diets, could contribute to such practices becoming a feasible option for more diverse groups. Individuals' preferred future lifestyles are those that align with their moral views, and therefore policymakers should embrace this (moral) diversity in the design of future policies.

AB  - Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems have generated a tremendous positive change in road safety and public transport operations. However, the literature reveals the need for a quantitative preventive risk evaluation from a microscopic approach, integrated with outcomes from accident-based and behavioral research, which is the primary purpose of this paper. Its scope includes five components: (1) a novel risk diagnosis and mapping for three selected signalized intersections of the BRT system of (Columbia) City, using an event-based exposure definition of encounters, the Swedish Traffic Conflict Technique, and T-Analyst. (2) Cross-comparison of risk outcomes between intersections, in search for risk factors. (3) Validation of encounters against traffic volumes. (4) Exploration of the relationship between the number of observed conflicts and the number of reported accidents, using an American predictive model. (5) Discussion of the microscopic findings against the behavior declared locally and the limitations of the literature. As a result, the method provides detailed risk verdicts from 61 h of video data. BRT turning buses, and risky pedestrian behavior, are risk factors. Many pedestrians crossed intersections, taking risks without evident cause. The findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that such behavior is caused by several sources of overstimulation. In conclusion, encounters define the conflict frequency, overcoming the limitations of aggregate indicators. Traffic volumes do not fully explain the risk because most events were due to disobedience. The number of reported accidents was much higher than expected, considering the number of conflicts observed as evidence of aggressiveness. Cars and taxicabs drivers declared risky attitudes coinciding with our observations. BRT drivers' behavior was acquiescent in most of the events observed, because the characteristics of BRT infrastructure. The findings comparison between signalized intersections and roundabouts allows for validating the methodology transferability.

AB  - Here, we review modeling predictions for Covid-19 mortality based on recent data. The Imperial College model trusted by the British Government predicted peak mortalities above 170 deaths per million in the United States, and above 215 deaths per million in Great Britain, after more than 2 months from the outbreak, and a length for the outbreak well above 4 months. These predictions drove the world to adopt harsh distancing measures and forget the concept of herd immunity. China had peak mortalities of less than 0.1 deaths per million after 40 days since first deaths, and an 80-day-long outbreak. Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, or Great Britain flattened the curve at 13.6, 28.6, 9.0, 10.6, and 13.9 deaths per million after 40, 39, 33, 44, and 39 days from first deaths, or 31, 29, 24, 38, and 29 days since the daily confirmed deaths reached 0.1 per million people, respectively. The declining curve is much slower for Italy, the Netherlands, or Great Britain than Belgium or Sweden. Opposite to Great Britain, Italy, or Belgium that enforced a complete lockdown, the Netherlands only adopted an "intelligent" lockdown, and Sweden did not adopt any lockdown. However, they achieved better results. Coupled to new evidence for minimal impact of Covid-19 on the healthy population, with the most part not infected even if challenged, or only mild or asymptomatic if infected, there are many good reasons to question the validity of the specific epidemiological model simulations and the policies they produced. Fewer restrictions on the healthy while better protecting the vulnerable would have been a much better option, permitting more sustainable protection of countries otherwise at risk of second waves as soon as the strict measures are lifted.

AB  - This paper describes various smart grid concepts, architectures, and details of associated technological demonstrations implemented worldwide. The survey is based on initiatives taken by EU and IEA (e.g. ETP, EEGI, EERA and IEA DSM) and description of projects conducted in Europe and US (e.g. FENIX, ADDRESS, EU-DEEP, ADINE, GridWise and SEESGEN-ICT). The report presents drivers, visions and roadmaps to develop smart grids worldwide including China and India. The survey encompasses various smart grid concepts, i.e. development of virtual power plant, active demand in consumer networks, DER aggregation business, active distribution network, and ICT applications to develop intelligent future grids. The comparison is carried out on the basis of commercial, technological, and regulatory aspects. In addition, the existing features of smart grid technology and challenges faced to implement it in Finnish environment are addressed. As a matter of fact, the implementation of smart grid is consisting of more than any one technology, therefore, this transition will not be so easy. In the end, a fully realized smart grid will be beneficial to all the stakeholders. Smart grid will be an outcome of an evolutionary development of the existing electricity networks towards an optimized and sustainable energy system.

AB  - A regional model for sustainable biogas electricity production was formulated and tested for a Finnish province, North-Savo. By using the model the aim was to support decision making for reducing green-house gas (GHG) emissions and increasing renewable energy (RE) production in the studied region in the biogas electricity production system. The system boundary of the model included transportation of waste, biogas production, heat and electricity production, as well as the delivery of heat and digestate to the end users. When electricity production was maximized in the studied region, the electricity production and GHG emissions were 20 GW h/year and 24 kt/year of CO2 equivalent, respectively. When GHG emissions were minimized, the electricity production and GHG emissions were 20 GW h/year and 23 kt/year of CO2 equivalent, respectively. By producing electricity of 20 GW h/year, the maximum GHG reductions were roughly 74% of the theoretical maximum GHG emissions of 90 kt/year of CO2 equivalent in both cases. The regional electricity production potential of 20 GW h/year was only 21% of the maximum electricity production potential of 94 GW h/year. The locations of biogas plants, regional relative GHG emissions, potential feedstocks and regional electricity production were optimized in both cases in the studied region. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Belowground communities support a great diversity of organisms, but the factors that maintain and regulate this diversity are poorly understood. Both abiotic and biotic factors affect the abundance, diversity and distribution of soil organisms, and the spatial heterogeneity in these factors is a key in explaining belowground biodiversity. However, a combined approach estimating the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors in small-scale structuring of soil communities is yet missing. Here, a semi-natural grassland in south-central Sweden with high diversity of plants was sampled at two spatial scales (10 and 60 cm intervals) with the aim to examine the relative roles of plant identity, abiotic environmental factors and spatial factors for the small-scale spatial patterns of nematodes. The data were analysed by variance partitioning with redundancy analysis. Space, vegetation and abiotics were of similar importance for variation in nematode community composition. However, the contribution of the different sets of variables differed between the different nematode feeding groups: plant-feeding nematodes were influenced more by spatial variables, fungal-feeding nematodes and omnivores/predators more by plants and bacterial-feeding nematodes more by abiotic variables. The ranges of spatial dependence for the different feeding groups were all of the same magnitude, around 1 m. The results add to the understanding of the factors that contribute to soil biodiversity, and they show that combining plant and abiotic variables into one set of environmental variables hide important information about the drivers for belowground community assembly.

AB  - The social and health care educator's role in educating future professionals need to be stronger emphasised and deserves international recognition. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an empirical model of social and health care educators' competence in higher and professional education. The presented research employed a cross-sectional study design. Data were collected using HeSoEduCo-instrument from 28 educational institutions in Finland. The model was empirically tested with confirmatory factor analysis through Structural Equation Modelling that applied the Full Imputation Maximum Likelihood estimator. A total of 422 social and health care educators participated in the study. The empirical model of social and health care educators including eight competence areas: leadership and management, collaboration and societal, evidence-based practice, subject and curriculum, mentoring students in professional competence development, student-centred pedagogy, digital collaborative learning, and cultural and linguistic diversity. All of the connections between concepts of the empirical model were found to be statistically significant. There were strong connections between most of the identified competence concepts; however, two weak connections were found, namely, the link between competence in evidence-based practice and competence in subject and curriculum, along with the link between competence in digital collaborative learning and competence in student-centred pedagogy. The presented empirical model can help stakeholders identify which areas of social and health care educators' curricula should be further developed. The model is also relevant for improving continuous education, allowing educators to assess their competence levels and evaluating educators' performance at the organisational level.

AB  - Background In species showing partial migration, as is the case for many salmonid fishes, it is important to assess how anthropogenic pressure experienced by migrating individuals affects the total population. We focused on brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the Guddal River in the Norwegian Hardanger Fjord system, which encompasses both resident and anadromous individuals. Aquaculture has led to increased anthropogenic pressure on brown trout during the marine phase in this region. Fish traps in the Guddal River allow for sampling all ascending anadromous spawners and descending smolts. We analyzed microsatellite DNA markers from all individuals ascending in 2006-2016, along with all emigrating smolts in 2017. We investigated (1) if there was evidence for declines in census numbers and effective population size during that period, (2) if there was association between kinship and migration timing in smolts and anadromous adults, and (3) to what extent resident trout were parents of outmigrating smolts. Results Census counts of anadromous spawners showed no evidence for a decline from 2006 to 2016, but were lower than in 2000-2005. Estimates of effective population size also showed no trends of declines during the study period. Sibship reconstruction of the 2017 smolt run showed significant association between kinship and migration timing, and a similar association was indicated in anadromous spawners. Parentage assignment of 2017 smolts with ascending anadromous trout as candidate parents, and assuming that unknown parents represented resident trout, showed that 70% of smolts had at least one resident parent and 24% had two resident parents. Conclusions The results bear evidence of a population that after an initial decline has stabilized at a lower number of anadromous spawners. The significant association between kinship and migration timing in smolts suggests that specific episodes of elevated mortality in the sea could disproportionally affect some families and reduce overall effective population size. Finally, the results based on parentage assignment demonstrate a strong buffering effect of resident trout in case of elevated marine mortality affecting anadromous trout, but also highlight that increased mortality of anadromous trout, most of which are females, may lower overall production in the system.

KW  - HYPOTHESIS
AB  - The two central paradigms of marine diversity are that there is a latitudinal cline of increasing species richness from poles to tropics and that species richness increases with depth to a maximum around 2,000 in and thereafter decreases. However, these paradigms were based on data collected in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Here I show that the 1960's data, are not representative and thus the paradigms need re-examination. New data from coastal areas in the northern hemisphere, record species richness as high as the highest recorded in the deep-sea. Whilst this suggests that the cline of increasing diversity from shallow to deep-sea does not exist, however, the database for the deep sea is not sufficient to draw such a conclusion. The basic problem with the data from the 1960s is that samples were taken on ecological scales and yet they are used to answer evolutionary questions. The questions that such data were to answer were why do the tropics have higher species richness than polar regions or why do deep-sea sediments have more species than coastal sediments? Evolutionary questions need data from much larger spatial areas. Recently, data representative of large scales have been collected from coastal areas in the northern hemisphere and show that there is a cline of increasing species richness from the Arctic to the tropics, but there does not yet seem to be a similar cline in the southern hemisphere. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the observed patterns in biodiversity. In terrestrial ecology the energy-productivity hypothesis has gained wide acceptance as an explanation for the latitudinal gradient. Here I examine this and other hypotheses critically. Finally an analysis of research priorities is made. Assessment is urgently needed of the spatial scales and dynamics of species richness from point samples to assemblages, habitats and landscapes, especially in coastal areas and in the tropics, where the threats to biodiversity are greatest. New technologies are available, such as side-scan sonar, acoustics, and under-water digital video cameras but as yet have been relatively little used. Conservation of marine biodiversity must be based on sound theory, yet marine diversity studies lag well behind those of terrestrial habitats.

AB  - Although farming practices are essentially situated in rural locations, they are also developing in urban environments and multiple rationalities underpin such initiatives. Urban farming practices are, among other things, recognized for their recreational and wellbeing effects (e.g., allotments) as well as to increase biodiversity and to mitigate flooding. More recently, food produced in digitally augmented and contained environments have become increasingly established in cities across the globe such as Stockholm, London, and New York. These ICT enabled farming practices are different from non-smart and outdoor farming. Specifically, indoor farming practices are founded upon the view that it can produce fresh food in urban settings all year round using fewer resources (e.g., land, water, and chemicals) and with reduced food miles. Since such knowledge claims may shape and structure the development and uptake of smart farming practices in urban environments they must be scrutinized. This paper begins to address this need for research by investigating the politics of smart farming expectations in relation to urban environments. Exploratory case study research was conducted on early formations of smart farming initiatives in Sweden. Drawing on the Sociology of Expectations, it explores the politics of knowledge claims embedded in smart farming initiatives at project level, and examines the performativity of these knowledge claims in envisioning more sustainable urban futures. The findings suggest that smart farming at the level of individual projects gives the appearance of change, but at the same time, it produces more of the same.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, there has been an increased interest in urban gardening. Queues for getting a gardening spot have grown, as many urban citizens seek a spot to cultivate vegetables, and studies have stressed how urban gardens can be one ingredient in creating more sustainable cities. Following the work of urban theorists Henry Lefebvre and Edward Soja, this study explores urban gardens as thirdspaces. Interviewing allotment gardeners and community gardeners in small Swedish cities, we explore allotments as 'lived places', where experiences, meanings and a sense of place are developed. Thirdspace suggests us to think beyond binary constructions of space and analysing narratives of urban gardening through that lens shows that allotment spots can be under-stood as places where certain dualisms have, if not a transgressed, at least a more flexible and expansive logic. The result illuminates how allotment gardens are a kind of nature-human crossing point and a practice con-necting city residents with countryside life and non-landowners with the land.

AB  - Do women with Turner karyotype have increased mortality and morbidity in the years after childbirth?
   No mortality occurred during pregnancy and follow-up in women with Turner karyotype, but a higher rate of circulatory and endocrine diseases and a high risk of aortic aneurysm were confirmed.
   Pregnancies in women with Turner karyotype are high-risk pregnancies with an increased risk of maternal mortality from aortic dissection and morbidity from hypertensive disorders.
   A retrospective Swedish population-based registry study of 124 women with Turner karyotype born between 1957 and 1987 and who gave birth between 1973 and 2010. Women with Turner karyotype without childbirth (n 378) were selected as controls. A second control group consisted of women from the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) (n 1230) matched for maternal age, number of children and year of birth of the first child.
   Women with Turner karyotype were identified in the Swedish Genetic Turner Register. Data were obtained by using the unique personal identification number with cross linkage to the Swedish MBR, the Cause of Death Register, the National Patient Register and the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95 confidence interval (CI) was used in the analysis of morbidity.
   No mortality occurred in women with Turner karyotype and childbirth. Diseases of the circulatory system occurred more often in women with Turner syndrome under the age of 40 years compared with the MBR control group (HR 4.59; 95 CI 2.757.66) but was similar at or above the age of 40 years. Morbidity from circulatory diseases was increased before pregnancy (HR 3.83; 95 CI 1.0214.43) and during pregnancy or within 1 year after (HR 5.78; 95 CI 1.9417.24), but was similar after 1 or more years after delivery (HR 1.91; 95 CI 0.744.96). Aortic aneurysm occurred in 11/502 (2.2) women with Turner karyotype and in three women (2.4) during pregnancy. The long-term follow-up showed that aortic dissection was a common cause of death in young women with Turner karyotype without childbirth. A thorough cardiac evaluation before pregnancy in women with Turner karyotype is of utmost importance.
   Although this was a population-based registry study performed over a period of more than 20 years, a much longer follow-up and larger series are needed to assess rare events. The study also lacks information on phenotype and mode of conception in women with Turner karyotype. Women who gave birth probably represent a selection of healthier women with Turner karyotype.
   The high risk of aortic aneurysm in young women with Turner karyotype is in agreement with the literature.
   No conflicts of interest exist.

AB  - Having a home is a central part of the everyday consumer experience. In our study, we focus on Finnish homeowners who have recently bought an apartment in a multi-family timber-framed building. With its merits in sustainability, the number of timber buildings in less-traditional urban applications is increasing, yet, research on living in a wooden home is scarce. To fill this gap, the study analyses how homeowners perceive the wooden material before and after living in a wooden home for one year. Thus, besides the acquisition of a home, the study examines the consumers' appropriation processes and aims to gain insight into the cultural sense-making behind the appreciation of wooden homes. The results of this qualitative study indicate that traditions and memories related to wood affect consumers' appreciations, for example, regarding the cosiness of a wooden home. The consumers discussed the weaknesses assigned to wood, such as fire and moisture susceptibility, yet, they considered them to concern all construction materials, not only wood. After habitation for one year, the usability of the home becomes particularly relevant, including the ease with which shelves can be mounted onto the walls, enjoying the echoless soundscape, and living with clicking sounds and vibrating floors. The study suggests that the meanings of consumers' daily experiences concerning the usability of wooden buildings are under negotiation and cannot be reduced simply into positive or negative but carry elements of both.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most important tree species in Eurasia. During the past centuries, it has been extensively introduced into artificial monocultures, but is currently experiencing a number of problems related to climate change and extreme droughts. There is a large-scale disintegration of its stands and, in addition to its replacement by other native trees, it is possible to use a wide range of introduced species of the same genus. The aim of the investigation was to compare production parameters, structure and diversity of pine stands at the age of 35 years in school Arboretum of Faculty of Forestry and Wood Science in Central Bohemia (320 m a.s.l., medium rich habitats, water deficit site). Seven species of pine were compared: ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex C. Hawson), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Ball.), black pine (Pinus nigra J.F.Arnold), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce Griseb.) and the only native Scots pine. The results showed that significantly (P < 0.001) highest height, diameter at breast height and mean stem volume were achieved in Pinus ponderosa and P. strobus stands, while these parameters were lowest in P. peuce and P. nigra. In contrast, the lowest stand volume was calculated for P. strobus (112 m(3).ha(-1)) due to the lower stand density, while the highest production was again in P. ponderosa (430 m(3).ha(-1)). In terms of structural variability, the highest diversity was found in P. jeffreyi and P. peuce. The introduced pine species, especially P. ponderosa, could therefore play an important role in terms of production and economic potential and even replace native P. sylvestris on suitable sites.

AB  - Changing lake water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations are of concern for lake management because of corresponding effects on aquatic ecosystem functioning, drinking water resources and carbon cycling between land and sea. Understanding the importance of human activities on TOC changes requires knowledge of past concentrations; however, water-monitoring data are typically only available for the past few decades, if at all. Here, we present a universal model to infer past lake water TOC concentrations in northern lakes across Europe and North America that uses visible-near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy on lake sediments. In the orthogonal partial least-squares model, VNIR spectra of surface-sediment samples are calibrated against corresponding surface water TOC concentrations (0.5-41 mg L-1) from 345 Arctic to northern temperate lakes in Canada, Greenland, Sweden and Finland. Internal model-cross-validation resulted in a R-2 of 0.57 and a prediction error of 4.4 mg TOC L-1. First applications to lakes in southern Ontario and Scotland, which are outside of the model's geographic range, show the model accurately captures monitoring trends, and suggests that TOC dynamics during the 20th century at these sites were primarily driven by changes in atmospheric deposition. Our results demonstrate that the lake water TOC model has multiregional applications and is not biased by postdepositional diagenesis, allowing the identification of past TOC variations in northern lakes of Europe and North America over time scales of decades to millennia.

AB  - In order to facilitate sustainable development, a shift from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning has been suggested. However, if we rely on the modern conceptualisation of accessibility, such a shift would have limited results. As an alternative, this paper proposes a relational reading of accessibility, which questions the divide between mobility and place upon which the modern definition is based. It argues that the accessibility of a place is characterised by a specific coordination of presences and absences that depends as much on boundaries and exclusions as on mobility. If accessibility changes, so does the place. This interpretation makes accessibility a matter of priorities and provides a critical perspective on arguments for time-space compressions and progress. This is illustrated here using the example of a regional strategy for transit-oriented development in Sweden (Region Scania). For that case, the discourse on accessibility revealed simplified arguments for densification, progress and metropolitan ideals, contradicting the initial inclusive intentions of the strategy. Thus, there is a need to put accessibility in place so that a shift to accessibility-based planning facilitates a move towards social and environmental sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As part of the transition to a sustainable future, energy-efficient buildings are needed to secure users' comfort and lower the built environment's energy footprint and associated emissions. This article presents a novel, realistic and affordable solution to minimize the footprint of smart building energy systems and enable higher renewable energy use in the building sector. For this, an intelligent system is being developed using a rule-based automation approach that considers thermal comfort, energy prices, meteorological data, and primary energy use. In order to lower the installation cost and part of the environmental footprint, batteries are not used, and the heat pump's size is decreased via component integration. Also, different renewable resources are effectively hybridized using photovoltaic thermal panels and an innovative biomass heater to increase the share of renewable energy, enhance reliability, and shave peak load. In order to secure feasibility, the suggested framework is assessed from the techno-economic and environmental standpoints for 100 residential apartments in Stockholm, Sweden. Our results show that 70.8 MWh of renewable electricity is transferred to the local grid, and the remaining 111.5 MWh is used to supply the building's needs and power the electrically-driven components. The biomass heater meets more than 65% of the space heating demand, mainly at low solar power and high electricity prices, illustrating the value of integration strategies to reduce the system's dependability on the local grid. The results further reveal that most energy purchases during the cloudy days and nights are repaid through the sale of excess renewable production during the warmer hours, with a bidirectional connection with the grid. The monthly energy cost is less than 140 $/MWh for most of the years. The cost can be held low due to the exclusion of batteries and minimizing the heat pump size. The proposed system has a low emission index of 11.9 kgCO2/MWh and can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 TCO2/year compared to using the supply from the Swedish energy mix.

TI  - Economic Ascendancy and Cultural Dominance in the Northern Areas of Pakistan: A Threat to the Existence of Burushaski
T2  - ENDANGERED LANGUAGES AND HISTORY
LA  - English
CP  - 13th International Conference on the Foundation-for-Endangered-Languages
AB  - Burushaski language is considered to be a unique and among the most ancient languages of the world. Despite new breakthroughs in ethnographic sciences, Burushaski defies classification and still remains a Language Isolate. (Dani, 1959) Presently it is spoken by the people living in three different valleys of Northern Areas of Pakistan: Hunza, Yasin and Nagar; and in parts of Kashmir India where a migrated minority resides. Two main dialects of Burushaski are spoken in the Hunza valley and the Yasin Valley. The former is divided into two closely related sub-dialects of Hunza and Nagar. Most of the languages spoken in Northern Areas of Pakistan i.e. Shina, Khwar, etc have their roots in Dardic languages (Dani, 2001) while Burushaski, together with Basque, Finnish and about a dozen other languages of the world, has been classified as a language isolate. The fact that its mother language has been lost and its sister languages have vanished make Burushaski an exceptionally unique part of the human heritage.
   After centuries of isolation, the society where this language was preserved is increasingly exposed to outside pressures and influences. With the opening of the area through the Karakoram Highway and other external influences, the language and culture face new challenges. Economic migration, increased awareness and influx of various cultures through travel and tourism have brought an immense cultural change. This economic ascendancy and cultural dominance has become a threat to Burushaski language. Since the phenomena of economic growth and cultural influx invariably go hand in hand, below I have narrated facts and examples, which cover both aspects simultaneously.
   In spite of the fact that the native inhabitants speak Burushaski as a means of communication, its inclusion in the school syllabus as a language is still missing. Urdu, being the national language, is the language of instruction and now with a flourishing tourism industry English has become another important language for the local people. Economic gains through trade have also encouraged the locals to learn and speak Chinese Turkish of the China border. Moreover, the political structure of the area necessitates the presence of army and government officials from the southern parts of the country, which entails the presence of other regional languages, which are mostly Pashtu or Punjabi.
   In this unending influx of other languages, Burusho have unconsciously started to drop their own ancient words and to use Urdu words instead. Due to the external influences, more than half the present-day Burushaski vocabulary is of Urdu, Khwar and Shina origin. In addition, over thirty thousand Burusho presently live in different cities of Pakistan for educational or economic purposes, whose environment forces them to use different languages. They have failed to retain Burushaski in their homes, and as a result a considerable number of these families, particularly children do not speak their mother tongue. All of these factors call for extraordinary measures to preserve and safeguard a language that not only represents the identity of a group of people but has scientific and heritage value globally.

AB  - The first aim of this two-study paper was to report psychometric properties of a brief 11-item measure of safety climate adapted to petro-maritime organizations. The second aim was to. examine potential indicators of predictive validity. Factor structure, internal consistency, and validity analyses were performed in two independent samples. The first sample consisted of 396 personnel working on offshore oil- and gas installations in the North Sea (response rate: 42%). The second sample comprised 594 crew members working on vessels belonging to two large Norwegian shipping companies (response rate: 73%). Data from both studies supported a three factor solution labelled Individual intention and motivation, Management prioritization, and Safety routines. The subscales had good psychometric properties. The validity indicators revealed correlations between the safety climate scales and transformational and authentic leadership, risk perception, health problems, intentions to leave, and job satisfaction in the expected directions. The present study indicates that this 11-item measure has a psychometrically sound factor structure that represents a theoretically meaningful and empirically anchored expression of safety climate in a petro-maritime organization.

AB  - Previous research on human fear of large carnivores has mainly been based on self-reports in which individual survey items and the objects of fear are measured, so whether a person fears attacks on humans or livestock and pets has not been identified. The objectives of this study were to differentiate between the objects of fear as well as capturing attitudes towards implementation of management actions and the potential for conflict index (PCI). These concern the implementation of a limited number of management actions currently used or discussed in Sweden that are aimed at reducing human fear of brown bears/wolves. 391 persons living in areas with either brown bear (n = 198) or wolf (n = 193) in Sweden responded to a questionnaire. The degree of self-reported fear varied between residents in brown bear areas and residents in wolf areas. The fear of attacks on livestock and pets was stronger than fear of attacks on humans in both brown bear and wolf areas. In brown bear areas, fear was strongest for livestock, while in wolf areas fear was strongest for pets. The fear of attacks on livestock and pets was significantly stronger in wolf areas, while the fear of attacks on humans was strongest in brown bear areas. In both brown bear and wolf areas, there was little acceptance of implementation of management actions that would allow people to carry pepper spray or a gun outdoors. Management actions aimed at setting a population cap for bear/wolf populations, information on how to act when encountering a bear/wolf, and providing information on local presence of bear/wolf had relatively high acceptability. This was especially true for respondents expressing high fear of attacks on humans.

AB  - In general, circular economy development is about a system-level change towards significantly enhanced circularity and sustainability encompassing both biological and technical cycles. This study aimed at exploring, identifying, analyzing and synthesizing how companies in the Kymenlaakso region perceive circular economy management, assessment and reporting. This study applied a qualitative research approach using a questionnaire survey as the specific method. The responding companies are of many sizes and represent multiple sectors such as industry, construction and various services. This study addressed a clear gap in research on company-level perspectives. The results indicate that recycling and recovery of materials are perceived as particularly important by companies. In addition, the principles of CE (10Rs) are considered to be important by most companies. Essential management approaches encompass, for example, CE strategy and goals, business ecosystems and development of markets for recycled and recovered products and parts. Companies considered that recycling, recovery, waste minimization and utilization of waste as a raw material, as well as an increase in recycled content in products, reduction in disposable products and prevention of premature obsolescence, are important CE assessment and measurement approaches. For example, continuous reporting of CE as a part of online communication of companies (i.a. sustainability and responsibility), the definition of best practices and best available techniques for CE, and reporting in the whole supply and value chain were perceived as important ways to report CE. However, it is noteworthy that many of the studied aspects of CE were not perceived to be important by companies. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the current state of and future outlook on circular economy development in the studied region and also highlights relevant management, assessment and reporting aspects from the perspective of local companies.

AB  - The biomonitoring properties of oak tree bark compared with the epiphytic moss Hypnum cupressiforme and the influence of the tree bark, as its growth substrate, on the content of heavy metals in moss were investigated. Samples of the epiphytic moss H. cupressiforme and oak tree bark (Quercus spp.) were collected in Eastern Romania at a total of 44 sampling sites. Parallel moss and bark samples were collected from the same sides of the trunk circumference. V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, and Bi were determined by ICP-MS. Principal component analysis was used to identify possible sources of metals in bark and moss. Six factors explaining 87 % of the total variance in the data set were chosen. The main factors represent long-range atmospheric transport of elements (Zn, Cd, (Pb), Bi, (Mo), (Tl)), local emissions from industrial sources (As, Cr, Ni, V), road traffic (Pb, Zn) and agricultural activities (Cu, (Zn)). The element concentrations in moss and bark samples are of the same order of magnitude. For almost all the elements, higher concentrations were obtained in moss. Significant correlations between concentrations in moss and bark samples were obtained for 7 of the 13 elements: V, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, In, and Bi, all typical anthropogenic pollutants. The use of tree bark for monitoring purposes might be an alternative in areas where there is a scarcity of mosses.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of the forty-year cultivation of Picea abies on the floristic composition, physical and chemical soil characteristics, and the intensity of organic matter decomposition in a zone of mountainous beech forest (Mt. Maljen, northwestern Serbia). The long-term cultivation of conifers in a deciduous habitat has caused a reduction in biodiversity, as well as changes in the soil which were most pronounced in the top soil layer. There were found to be lower soil moisture levels (p<0.05), lower active (p<0.01) and substitutional acidity (p<0.001), depletion of the adsorption complex in base cations (p<0.001), and lower levels of N, P and K (p<0.001) in the spruce stand in relation to the beech stand (control). The higher C/N ratio of spruce litter (p<0.001) caused its lower decomposition rate in comparison to beech litter (p<0.01). All these changes have led to degradation and a reduction in this ecosystem's productivity.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify and assess for the first time the variability of total mercury in urban soils at a European level, using a systematic sampling strategy and a common methodology. We report results from a comparison between soil samples from Aveiro (Portugal), Glasgow (Scotland), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Sevilla (Spain), Torino (Italy) and Uppsala (Sweden).
   At least 25 sampling points (in about 4-5 ha) from a park in each city were sampled at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm). Total mercury was determined by pyrolysis atomic absorption spectrometry with gold amalgamation. The quality of results was monitored using certified reference materials (BCR 142R and BCR 141R).
   Measured total mercury contents varied from 0.015 to 6.3 mg kg(-1). The lowest median values were found in Aveiro, for both surface (0-10 cm) and sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples (0.055 and 0.054 mg kg(-1), respectively). The highest median mercury contents in soil samples were found in samples from Glasgow (1.2 and 1.3 mg kg(-1), for surface and sub-surface samples, respectively).
   High variability of mercury concentrations was observed, both within each park and between cities. This variability reflecting contributions from natural background, previous anthropogenic activities and differences in the ages of cities and land use, local environmental conditions as well as the influence of their location within the urban area. Short-range variability of mercury concentrations was found to be up to an order of magnitude over the distance of only a few 10 m. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Substitution of fossil gaseous fuels with biomass-based gases is of interest to the iron and steel industry due to its role in the mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In switching from fossil fuels to biomass-based gases, a systems analysis of the full value chain from biomass supply to the production and supply of final gas products becomes crucial. This study uses process and heat integration methods in combination with a supply chain evaluation to analyse full value chains of biomass-based gases for fossil gas replacement within the iron and steel industry. The study is carried out as a specific case study in order to understand the implications of utilizing bio-syngas/bio-SNG as heating fuels in iron- and steel-making, and to provide insights into the most sensitive parameters involved in fuel switching. The results show a significant cost difference in the fuel production of the two gas products owing to higher capital and biomass use in the bio-SNG value chain option. When tested for sensitivity, biomass price, transportation distance, and capital costs show the most impact on fuel production costs across all options studied. Trade-offs associated with process integration, plant localisation, feedstock availability and supply were found to varying extents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The off-site effects of agricultural organic soils include the leaching of N, P, and organic carbon (OC) to watercourses and CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions into the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to quantify how the thickness of organic layers affects these loads. A 19.56-ha experimental field drained by subsurface pipes was established in Ruukki, northwestern Finland. Three plots had a 60-80 cm-thick sedge peat layer and three others had a thickness of 20 cm or less. The drainage pipes lie in mineral soil that, in this field, contains sulfidicmaterial. This study documents the experimental settings and reports on the leaching of substances in the first two years, as well as CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions during eight weeks in one summer. Total N (TN) and OC loads were higher from the thicker peat plots. The mean TN loads during a hydrological year were 15.4 and 9.2 kg ha(-1) from the thicker and thinner peat plots, respectively, with organic N representing 36% of TN load. Total P (TP) load averaged 0.27 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Dissolved P load represented 63 and 36% of TP in the thicker peat area and only 23 and 13% in the thinner peat area, and was thus increased upon peat thickness. These N and P loads through the subsurface drainage system represented roughly 83% of TN and 64% of TP loads from this field. There were no clear differences in greenhouse gas emissions among the plots during the eight-week monitoring period. Slowly oxidizing sulfide in the subsoil resulted in annual leaching of 147 kg S ha(-1), almost ten times that of non-sulfidic soils. Our first results emphasize the effect of the peat thickness on the leaching of substances and warn about considering all organic soils as a single group in environmental assessments.

AB  - Soil microflora can directly take up the amino acids (Aas) released by decomposing plants and use them, together with de novo synthesized Aas, as building blocks for their own structures, which are expected to have an Aa composition that differs from plant-derived structures. The degree of change in the Aa composition during OM decomposition should reflect the degree of N evolution. Here we apply this concept to the study of three litter decomposition sequences in European forests: boreal (Pinus sylvestris L., Jadraas, Sweden), cool Atlantic (Pinus sylvestris L., La Gileppe, Belgium), and warm Atlantic (Pinus pinaster L., Montemor, Portugal). Litter was sorted into six decomposition stages according to morphological features: from intact, light-brown needles to dark needle fragments with faunal perforations. At each stage, the Aa composition of the litter was studied by acid hydrolysis plus liquid chromatography of the hydrolysates. Both the Aa content of the litter and the unhydrolyzable/total OC ratio increased with decomposition, but this was not the case with the unhydrolyzable/total N ratio. There is no sole pattern of Aa change with decomposition: in Jadraas and Montemor most of the changes occur in the initial and final steps, while in La Gileppe the changes seem quite evenly spread throughout the decomposition. The fact that the Aa composition of the litter did not converge with decomposition suggests the existence site-specific biotas with contrasted Aa fingerprints. The abundance of a given Aa relative to the total differed among Aas and sites; but for some Aas it was possible to detect common patterns of decomposition behaviour (either a consistent increase or a consistent decrease). The aa/total ratio for Gly, Ala and Thr consistently increased with decomposition. These Aas were used to search for a numerical index, the Aa signature (Aa(SIG)), which would reflect the changes in Aa composition from fresh debris to highly decomposed organic materials. The change in the proposed AaSIG was found to correlate well with the mathematical distance from the starting point (calculated as the euclidean distance); this suggests that it could be potentially useful as an indicator of N evolution during litter decomposition, at least in its first stages.

AB  - The study aims to estimate the agricultural economic-environmental efficiency (eco-efficiency) for European countries. Eco-efficiency is obtained by the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using a generalized maximum entropy (GME) approach. Agriculture gross value added (GVA) is considered as the desirable output and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as the undesirable output. Capital, labour, land, energy and nutrients are regarded as inputs. The GVA/GHG ratio is the measure of eco-efficiency. The estimation was made for the years 2005 and 2010, which correspond to the year of commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the most recent year with information concerning all the variables in the study, and is a period that can allow us to see some changes after the agreement. The results show that in 2005, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Portugal revealed the higher levels of eco-efficiency; and countries such as Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Latvia and Slovakia are the group with the lowest levels of eco-efficiency. In 2010, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal are the group of countries with the higher levels of eco-efficiency, while Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Romania and the United Kingdom are the group with the lowest levels of eco-efficiency.

AB  - Evolving complex concepts, such as bioeconomy, cannot be applied without selecting (consciously or unconsciously) some definitions and excluding others. This process of selection may have a considerable impact on how bioeconomy is understood. This paper presents how the concept of bioeconomy took shape in a participatory development project that created foundations for new professional specialisation studies within the Finnish bioeconomy. Written documents (n = 21), produced in different phases of the project, were analysed with qualitative content analysis to find out how bioeconomy was A) understood as an activity, and B) conceptually linked with different global meta-discourses. Bioeconomy was primarily understood as an intensive use of diverse biomasses within a forest cluster, agriculture, the food industry, waste management and the energy sector, whereas many other bioeconomy sectors were marginalised or excluded. The idea that biomasses should be saved was very rare, and the concepts that prioritise some biomass uses over others, such as the cascade principle, were excluded. Bioeconomy itself was understood as a societally and globally influential new way of thinking i.e. as a meta-discourse. Strong associations were also made to nationalistic and statist meta-discourses. Conceptual transformation during the project was most distinct in the sustainable development meta-discourse: sustainability turned from a self-evident characteristic of bioeconomy into a consciously reflected and desirable goal. The results illustrate how a common consensus of bioeconomy is built through exclusion and inclusion in a participatory development project. Project organisers should be conscious about this process and explicitly state how and why some aspects, actors and activities are emphasised while others are downplayed or excluded in their bioeconomy projects. Only then we can create far-reaching policies and considered actions to guide societies toward the desired and defined future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is going to present a new tool that can determine the area of necessary innovations, evaluate innovations as well as their impacts on companies' three sustainability pillars which has been developed within an international research project EFORWOOD with focus on traditional forest based industries. Study has been carried out in Sweden, Spain and Finland, and in four following sectors - furniture, pellets, printing and publishing, and packaging. However, this presentation is dedicated printing and publishing sector. The importance of consumption as an innovation-driver must be taken into account when investigating fields of innovation that can secure sustainability of printing and publishing industries. There is of highest importance for forest-based industries to become aware of needs, perceptions, attitudes and demands of the buyers of fibre-based products in order to recognise which innovations are necessary to implement. Companies should also have high quality information concerning how buyers' actions, behaviour, preferences and changing demands together with those innovations can influence three pillars of sector sustainability: economic sustainability, social sustainability and environmental sustainability. Studies recognized a great necessity to develop a tool that can convert traditional qualitative results into quantitative and measurable results giving direct answer regarding required innovations and their impacts on sustainability. The tool is composed of three parts that can be used separately depending on stage of innovation process that company would like to carry out: Gathering information and data in a qualitative research process. This will give a description of buyers' actions, behaviour, preferences and changing demands Identifying "hot spots". This results in determination of necessary innovations areas and their linkage to sustainability pillars (quantitative result) Identifying required innovations and estimating their importance level and value of impact regarding sustainability pillars (strategic and sustainable result)

AB  - Aalto New Campus Complex (ANCC) is a recently inaugurated educational facility at Aalto University, located in Otaniemi (Espoo), Finland. Within over 40,000 m(2), it comprises two faculties, a shopping center, recreational areas, and a metro station. ANCC is also a large-scale application of Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP)-Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) in Finland, comprising an irregular BTES field of 74 boreholes with an overall length of roughly 23 km and 4 million m(3) of energy storage. Therefore, accurate monitoring of the GSHP-BTES energy system is crucial for sustainable and efficient long-term operation. Due to the fundamental issues affecting the accuracy of all thermal energy meters, a novel methodology adjusting for consistency of the measured data (in order to accomplish daily energy balance on both sides of the GSHP) is developed. The proposed methodology is used also in conjunction with reconstruction of missing relevant data before April/May 2020 by applying linear regression techniques. The developed data management is considered essential due to its capability to handle measured data with high uncertainty (thermal meters) by using highly accurate data regarding the GSHP power demand. Additionally, operational data and relevant GSHP performance indicators for the 18-month period starting from July 2019 is presented and analyzed.

AB  - The growing concern of the impact of climate change in forestry has prompted tree improvement programs and regulatory agencies to integrate climate change adaptation in the production and use of tree seed. In support of such adaptation strategies, we conducted a case study for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) in Alberta, Canada. We compared the tree height for populations and families planted across 37 progeny and provenance trials when transferred among six physiogeographically and climatically distinct breeding regions. Based on these results we infer how lodgepole populations and families are adapted to current climate conditions and how they might respond to future changes in climate. Interestingly, in almost all regions we found that local populations grew better than introduced sources, suggesting that in the current climate the use of local populations is still an appropriate reforestation strategy with some exceptions. Notably, in cool and wet higher elevation environments (between 1050 and 1650 m), local populations were outgrown by populations originating from warmer lower elevation regions. Moreover, these higher elevation populations were always outgrown when transferred to other regions. A number of transfers among regions were identified that ensure productivity gains under recent climate conditions, and simultaneously represent a short term adaptation measure for warming of about +0.5 degrees C. Further, we provide a database for selection of families within breeding populations to enhance their resilience to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we examine sustainable consumption from a ski area perspective by using the exploratory sequential mixed-method approach. We apply a cross-national approach to investigate how customers' preferences for sustainable service alternatives translate into willingness-to-pay, comparing results from Norway and Switzerland. The results show that alpine skiers in general report being willing to pay more for a day pass if the ski area is either environmentally-certified, carbon-neutral, or uses only natural snow. The positive effects are reported even stronger among environmentally-friendly skiers and skiers from Switzerland. We discuss the implications our results have for ski area managers wanting to incorporate sustainability in the overall pricing strategy.

AB  - In a companion paper (Xian et al., 2022, part 1 of the study), we present an Arctic aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatology and trend analysis for 2003-2019 spring and summertime periods derived from a combination of aerosol reanalyses, remote-sensing retrievals, and ground observations. Continued from the previous discussion and as the second part of the study, we report the statistics and trends of Arctic AOD extreme events using the U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System ReAnalysis version 1 (NAAPS-RA v1), the sun photometer data from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites, and the oceanic Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. Here, extreme AOD events are defined as events with AOD exceeding the 95th percentile (denoted "AOD(95)") of AOD distributions for given locations using 6-hourly or daily AOD data. While AERONET and MAN data estimate the Arctic median 550 nm AOD value to be 0.07, the 95th percentile value is 0.24. Such extreme events are dominated by fine-mode aerosol particles, largely attributable to biomass burning (BB) smoke events for the North American Arctic, the Asian Arctic, and most areas of the Arctic Ocean. However, extreme AOD events for the lower European Arctic are more attributable to anthropogenic and biogenic fine particles. The extreme-event occurrence dominance of sea salt is largely limited to the North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea. The extreme AOD amplitudes of anthropogenic and biogenic fine-mode and sea salt AOD are, however, significantly lower than those regions where extreme smoke AOD is dominant. Even for sites distant from BB source regions, BB smoke is the principal driver of AOD variation above the AOD(95) threshold. Maximum AOD values in the high Arctic in 2010-2019 have increased compared to 2003-2009, indicating stronger extreme BB smoke influence in more recent years. The occurrence of extreme smoke events tended to be more equally distributed over all months (April-August) during the 2003-2009 period while being more concentrated in the late season (July-August) during the 2010-2019 period. The temporal shift of the occurrence of AOD extreme events is likely due to improved control of early-season agriculture burning, climate-changerelated increases in summertime lightning frequencies, and a reduction in anthropogenic pollution over the 2010-2019 period.

AB  - This paper gives a review of several studies where the effects of different forest management methods on polyporous fungi and beetles, and the importance of woodland key habitats (WKHs) for polypore diversity were investigated in different zones of boreal forest in Finland. The total species richness of beetles was relatively well maintained in the seed-tree cut pine forests over the time span of 15 years, but the proportion of rare species had decreased, obviously because the lack of suitable substrate. In the clear-cut spruce forests which were planted for pine the beetle community had changed considerably due to the change of the major tree species and changes in microclimate. Proportion of rare species was low on clear-cuts. The polypore diversity in the seed-tree cut pine forests was relatively well maintained on the pre-logging CWD still 40 years after logging, but on the logging waste only about half of the total species richness was found. In the selectively logged spruce forests neither the forest structure nor the diversity of polypores had returned to natural level in 60-100 years. The results show that there is a time lag of several decades before the real effects of logging are detectable in the saproxylic and saprotrophic communities. WKHs selected on the basis of rich vascular plant flora maintained poorly the characteristic polypore flora of boreal forests. Small (0.2 ha) WKHs covered only about 20% the detected total species richness of polypores. Leaving large-diameter retention trees and CWD in regeneration areas would benefit many saproxylics. It seems, however, difficult to maintain in managed forests the diversity of those saproxylics, which have adapted to the steady, moist microclimate of old-growth spruce forests. Relatively large (0.5-1 ha) unlogged patches of typical old-growth forests would help to maintain both polypore and beetle. diversity of spruce stands.

AB  - Productive Norway spruce forests in mountainous growing areas are expected to be affected by increasing climate-driven disturbances, which will most likely result in a reduction of their economic performance. This study seeks to compare the potential of currently discussed management options aiming to maintain the economic performance on typical sites of spruce under a changing climate. For this purpose, we used a combined approach of tree mortality simulation and portfolio optimization to assess the management options: (1) including a deciduous species, (2) establishing mixed stands, (3) shortening the rotation periods, (4) forest protection measures focusing on bark beetles and (5) introducing another highly productive species. As a novel feature, we also compared the effect of combined management strategies on the return and risk of stand management. In our simulation and optimization approach, the inclusion of an alternative, highly productive tree species, such as Douglas fir, into the tree species portfolio outcompeted the forest protection measure of intensive bark beetle monitoring with timely sanitation fellings in terms of balancing risks and returns. The adaptation gain of introducing Douglas fir was further enhanced when combined with additional management options such as adapted rotation periods. The resulting synergies were able to overcompensate for the adverse economic effects of climate change. On the contrary, including beech did not only reduce the risks but also the return in a magnitude which was clearly outcompeted by Douglas fir, even with the assumption of high mortality risks for Douglas fir. These results prove the importance of a proactive tree species selection in relation to more reactive forest protection measures for climate change adaptation. They also advise a careful consideration of expected market demands when selecting an additional species for the portfolio.

AB  - Forests in Germany cover around 11.4 million hectares and, thus, a share of 32% of Germany's surface area. Therefore, forests shape the character of the country's cultural landscape. Germany's forests fulfil a variety of functions for nature and society, and also play an important role in the context of climate levelling. Climate change, manifested via rising temperatures and current weather extremes, has a negative impact on the health and development of forests. Within the last five years, severe storms, extreme drought, and heat waves, and the subsequent mass reproduction of bark beetles have all seriously affected Germany's forests. Facing the current dramatic extent of forest damage and the emerging long-term consequences, the effort to preserve forests in Germany, along with their diversity and productivity, is an indispensable task for the government. Several German ministries have and plan to initiate measures supporting forest health. Quantitative data is one means for sound decision-making to ensure the monitoring of the forest and to improve the monitoring of forest damage. In addition to existing forest monitoring systems, such as the federal forest inventory, the national crown condition survey, and the national forest soil inventory, systematic surveys of forest condition and vulnerability at the national scale can be expanded with the help of a satellite-based earth observation. In this review, we analysed and categorized all research studies published in the last 20 years that focus on the remote sensing of forests in Germany. For this study, 166 citation indexed research publications have been thoroughly analysed with respect to publication frequency, location of studies undertaken, spatial and temporal scale, coverage of the studies, satellite sensors employed, thematic foci of the studies, and overall outcomes, allowing us to identify major research and geoinformation product gaps.

AB  - Introduction: Promoting inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable communities is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals ratified in 2015 by 193 UN member states, not least in Sweden. Social sustainability involves preserving particular societal values (e.g., local identity) as well as developing values (e.g., social cohesion) that are perceived as needed. Socially sustainable development also implies promoting integration and preventing segregation. Social capital is one important indicator to measure how socially sustainable an area is. This project aims to explore how social capital can be used as a conceptual tool in developing housing policy for social sustainability in Umea Municipality.
   Methods: The three sub-studies in this project combine quantitative and qualitative methods. We will conduct a review of the municipality's documents to understand how the ideas of social sustainability have influenced political declarations and implemented social and housing policies and interventions during the period 2006-2020. The quantitative study includes a longitudinal follow-up to the 2006 survey's respondents to assess the longitudinal impacts of neighborhood social capital on health and well-being; as well as a new repeated cross-sectional survey to investigate how social capital has changed in local neighborhoods from 2006 to 2020. The qualitative study includes case studies in neighborhoods with different social capital dynamics to understand how different resident sub-groups perceive their neighborhoods and how implemented social and housing policies have influenced the social capital dynamics and responded to the needs of different sub-groups. The project is run in close collaboration with the Commission for a Socially Sustainable Umea.
   Discussions: This project will create new and unique perspectives on long-term structural changes of relevance for a socially sustainable housing policy; knowledge that is highly valuable for continuous municipal planning; and will outline recommendations to guide local housing policies for social sustainable neighborhoods in Umea Municipality.
   Ethics: This study has been assessed and approved by the Swedish Ethics Review Authority (Dnr: 2019-04395; Dnr: 2020-00160; Dnr 2020-02757).
   Dissemination: The dissemination goals of this project are (1) sustained engagement of key stakeholders throughout the project and (2) dissemination of the research findings through popular science, conferences, and scientific papers.

AB  - As an alternative to the car, the bicycle is considered important for obtaining more sustainable urban transport. The bicycle has many positive effects; however, bicyclists are more vulnerable than users of other transport modes, and the number of bicycle related injuries and fatalities are too high. We present a clustering analysis aiming to support the identification of the locations of bicyclists' perceived unsafety in an urban traffic network, so-called bicycle impediments. In particular, we used an iterative k-means clustering approach, which is a contribution of the current paper, and DBSCAN. In contrast to standard k-means clustering, our iterative k-means clustering approach enables to remove outliers from the data set. In our study, we used data collected by bicyclists travelling in the city of Lund, Sweden, where each data point defines a location and time of a bicyclist's perceived unsafety. The results of our study show that 1) clustering is a useful approach in order to support the identification of perceived unsafe locations for bicyclists in an urban traffic network and 2) it might be beneficial to combine different types of clustering to support the identification process.

AB  - Nationalism is frequently considered as an extreme, 'hot' phenomenon related to often violent nation/state-building processes. Billig's Banal Nationalism turned the attention to how nationalism is also 'flagged' and routinely reproduced in existing states. This article studies the mobilization of these forms of nationalism and suggests that independence is a useful notion in bridging the hot/banal divide and for tracing the 'hot in the banal'. Whereas for separatist movements independence is primarily a goal aspired to, in existing states independence/sovereignty is used to bring together hot and banal forms of nationalism which are mobilized in reproducing the discourses/practices related to the purported national identity. This paper first outlines a heuristic framework for conceptualizing independence and its key dimensions in relation to hot and banal nationalism as well as state-territory building. Secondly, the paper will study empirically the merit of the notion of independence regarding nationalism research via four themes: (1) the role of independence in Finland's state/nation-building process, spatial socialization and in mixing hot and banal nationalism; (2) the use of the 'independence card' by (nationalist) parties; (3) the mobilization of nationalist practices/discourses in the performativity of Finnish Independence Day; and (4) the resistance that the independence celebrations have incited. This study shows that the idea of independence in this context is inward-looking, draws on Othering, and is flagged in media and spatial socialization (e.g. education) using particular iconographies, landscapes, events, and memories related above all to wars. Rather than expressing hot or banal nationalism these discourses/practices effectively merge the two, challenging any simple dichotomy between them. The performativity of Independence Day in particular displays this blending. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The politics of dark ecologies in Deepan Sivaraman's <i>Peer Gynt</i>
T2  - PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - This article analyses Deepan Sivaraman's 2012 production of Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt (1876) and argues that the production's scenography evoked scepticism toward the Indian nation-state. This scepticism came as a direct consequence of the scenography's ability to alienate the audience through the formation of dark ecological environments, with the help of three characters: the elf princess, the son of the elf princess, and a hell hound, a concept invented by Sivaraman while adapting the verse play of the Norwegian playwright into Malayalam and English. The dark ecological aesthetics of the production functioned like Bertolt Brecht's Gestus and Verfremdungseffekt, offering a dialectical point to the audience to reterritorialize their understanding of the Indian nation-state and its ecology. In the first part of the article, I analyse the Indian dramatic form of bhana used by Sivaraman to articulate the discourse of what Timothy Morton calls 'dark ecology,' and argue that the bhana's satirical narrative remained central to writings of Otherness. In the second part of the article, I demonstrate how the production mounted imbricated narratives of ecological awareness on the stage through the figures of the elf princess, her son, and a hell hound that relentlessly witnessed the capitalist journey of Peer. By offering an active agency to these figures through the scenography, Sivaraman's production interrogated the Indian nation-state's definition of ecology. Significantly, in its choice of a non-human witness, the production destabilized the human centre and pointed towards a post-human ecological turn. Although Ibsen's aesthetics have been used countless times in India to stage the anxieties of the female gender and minority communities, this was the first time they were employed in India to stage dark ecology; Sivaraman's production began where Ibsen's play ends. In the first scene itself, the audience members found themselves face to face with Peer's spirit - rather than the flesh and blood Peer of Ibsen's play - begging God for another chance at life so that he could become a better man. When Peer is offered a second chance, he uncannily uses it to become a non-resident businessman involved in mining. The performance showed how scenography could be used to articulate a dark and depressing ecological awareness.

AB  - The raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, a medium-sized canid, is a representative of the East Asian fauna and has been introduced to Europe during the years 1928-1953. Today, this alien carnivore is a widespread species in Eastern Europe, Finland and Germany. In our study, we determined home range sizes of raccoon dogs in an agricultural landscape in Northeast Germany between 2001 and 2004 by very high frequency radio tracking. Those data are useful for estimation of predator densities in respect to conservation of biodiversity and also to develop models for disease and parasite transmission. Yearly average home range sizes were calculated as 95% fixed kernel: 1.83 km(2) +/- 1.54 and as 50% fixed kernel (=core areas): 0.50 km(2) +/- 0.49. We documented seasonal differences in home range sizes as well as overlapping of home ranges from 0.65% up to 67%. Some individuals' home ranges recorded during the same season showed a clear shifting between different years. Abandoned badger dens, located in the core areas of raccoon dogs home ranges, were important during the whole year and particularly used in the winter period. Therefore, distribution of those dens had some influence on the spatial distribution of raccoon dogs in the study area. Based on mean annual home range size, we estimated the mean local population density during winter as 1.1 individuals per square kilometre and during summer as 4.90 individuals per square kilometre.

AB  - The main trend during tire last 60 years is from segregation via integration towards inclusion. Throughout the whole period there has been a debate on what is best for the pupils involved. By a literature study of ca. 70 books or articles published in either Denmark, Norway or Sweden and registered in Scandinavian databases I have enlightened the research question: What do research and experts point out as the best road towards inclusion ? The findings reveal (1) there are few and a bit controversial results so far, (2) slowly the inclusion ideology influences the practical organisation and implementation of education in primary and secondary schools; (3) there are pupils, parents and professional still believing that a segregated track will produce more well-being, better self-esteem and more societal inclusion for a child with certain dysfunction like some levels of mental retardation. These stakeholders are able to find research and expert support for their view; and (4) certain factors seem to be particularly promising for promoting inclusion. Tire validity of these findings can be affected by weaknesses linked to changeability of concepts' content over years and geographical/cultural context. The attitude of the researches and the readers of the published literature in the field will most likely colour how fire research results are understood. That causes reliability problems. So do the problems of controlling of all the factors involved in studies comparing what gives most inclusion for whom: a segregated or an integrated track

AB  - The sustainable use of natural resources is critical for addressing the global challenges of today. Strategies for sustainable harvesting need to consider not only harvested species, but also other non-harvested species interacting with them in the same ecosystem. In addition, environmental variation needs to be considered, with climate change currently being one of the main sources of this variation. Understanding the consequences of complex interactions between different drivers and processes affecting dynamics of species and ecosystems across spatial scales requires large-scale integrative research projects. The Norwegian research initiative "Sustainable management of renewable resources in a changing environment: an integrated approach across ecosystems" (SUSTAIN) was launched to fill knowledge gaps related to the sustainable management of populations and ecosystems experiencing climate change. SUSTAIN investigated terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems in boreal and Arctic regions, using both theoretical developments and empirical analyses of long-term data. This Climate Research Special contains both synthesis articles and original research exemplifying some of the approaches used in SUSTAIN. In this introduction we highlight 4 key topics addressed by SUSTAIN: (i) population structure, (ii) interactions between species, (iii) spatial processes, and (iv) adaptive management. These topics are fundamental to the understanding of harvested species from an ecosystem perspective, and to ecosystem-based management approaches, which we are striving to work towards.

AB  - Due to the acceleration of urbanization, the municipal waste (MW) problem has transformed into a global challenge for urban sustainability. To elucidate historical trends, current focal points, and future directions in MW research, we conducted a bibliometric analysis and employed knowledge graph visualization to scrutinize a total of 34 212 articles, which were published between 1991 and 2021 in the Web of Science (WoS) core database. The results indicated that current major research themes encompass waste classification and recycling, waste management and public behavior, waste disposal methods and technologies, as well as environmental impact and evaluation. There has been a shift in the research focus from the environmental impacts of waste incineration to sustainable management related issues. A comparison of research from six typical countries revealed the differences in research priorities and techniques advantages. Scholars from the USA and Britain initiated MW research earlier than other countries and investigated management issues in depth, such as public behavior and willingness to pay. Meanwhile, Japanese, German, and Swedish scholars conducted extensive studies on advanced waste treatment technologies, such as disposal and recycling, risk assessment, and waste-to-energy techniques. Chinese scholars placed particular emphasis on end-of-pipe treatments and their associated environmental impacts. Hotspots and potential future frontiers were identified by burst detection analysis. Keywords with high value of burst index (BI) worldwide are food waste and circular economy. Chinese scholars have put great efforts on waste environmental impact and its recycling technologies, while we' re expecting to further investigating vulnerable population. Furthermore, this study contributes to bridging the regional gap of scientific research among different countries and fostering international collaboration.

AB  - Across Scandinavia, we witness an increased interest in making provisions for urban cemeteries to evolve as recreational landscapes. However, this development comes with its own set of challenges when uniting its pri-mary function as a place for disposal of human remains with active and passive urban recreation. In this paper, we explore varying perspectives on recreational use of cemeteries to give a nuanced picture of the possibilities and limitations for recreation at cemeteries in a multicultural society, most often positioned within a context of densifying urban areas. The empirical data consists of interviews with cemetery users (N = 24) from various faiths and belief systems in three towns in Norway and Sweden. Findings reveal that passive recreational ac-tivities like strolling, having a cup of coffee on a bench in the cemetery etc. are in general perceived as acceptable behaviour. However, opinions differ on 'active' undertakings like running, biking and walking a dog. How people perceive or use cemeteries is partly dependent on beliefs and cultural traditions, but other factors such as the purpose of using the cemetery for recreation and the type or character of the cemetery also impact the extent to which activities are perceived as appropriate or not. Respect and intensity are two key aspects that emerged in our analysis. The study concludes that the existing peaceful atmosphere at cemeteries should be preserved and nurtured. With correct design and zoning, some recreational activities can be integrated at cemeteries, benefiting both mourners and recreational visitors.

KW  - V Master Plan of the Spanish Cooperation 2018-2021
AB  - The link between security and development has been widely debated in recent years. New cooperation instruments such as the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa have focused on the use of cooperation mechanisms for purposes that differ from the classic objectives of development cooperation such as the fight against poverty or those currently included in the Sustainable Development Goals. That fact has been a controversial situation in political and academic field and among the cooperation experts'.
   This document provides an analysis of the links between development and security. Within this framework, it is worth highlighting how, from a general approach, preventing violent extremism (PVE) and terrorism can be tackled tangentially through some global development objectives such as conflict prevention or the strengthening of the rule of law. The position of international organisations on this issue, including the initiatives of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the institution which, within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), monitors and evaluates the development policies of its member countries, and of the European Union, will make it possible to reflect further on possible ways of collaboration between the prevention of terrorism and radicalisation and development cooperation.
   In addition, examples are given of countries that have incorporated interventions in this area as part of their development policy, such as Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden. In conclusion, it analyses Spain's position in this regard, specifically following the approval of the V Master Plan for Spanish Cooperation 2018-2021. The study of the prioritized goals and the lines of action included in the Master Plan will allow assessing whether terrorism prevention can be considered in development cooperation planning and identifying specific proposals for action that contribute to minimizing favourable contexts for radicalization and terrorism.

TI  - Vulnerability and adaptive capacity in Hammerfest, Norway
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - This article focuses on vulnerability assessment and climate change adaptation strategies in the city of Hammerfest (Northern Norway). The analysis is based on the CoastAdapt framework and will be looking at both current and future climate. Vulnerability is split into "natural vulnerability", "socio-economic vulnerability" and "institutional vulnerability". Historically, Hammerfest has been vulnerable to avalanches and landslides, and has over time built up considerable climate adaptive experience. Hammerfest is now undergoing deep transformation. The petroleum industry descended on Hammerfest in 2002; ten years later it provides employment for more than 1 000 people in a town with a total population of approximately 10 000. Over this period, new property taxes and other sources of income have made Hammerfest an affluent community. The result is considerable investment in urban development and new infrastructure (schools, a culture center, new sewers and a streets renovation scheme, etc.). In terms of climate adaptation the impact of the oil industry may be seen as a double edge sword. On the one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have rocketed. One the other hand, the economic development has boosted the municipality's revenue and population, thus enabling Hammerfest to consider, and spends money on, local climate adaptive projects that are far beyond the realm of possibility for neighbouring municipalities. The article will look at the instruments employed by Hammerfest in this process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many football epidemiological studies have been performed but only two of them have investigated injury risk in a national football team. In the present study, the senior male Qatar national football team was followed prospectively for two seasons. All injuries that were incurred during training and matches were recorded, together with match and training exposure time. Principal findings were (i) a higher injury incidence during matches than during training, (65.9 vs 4.3/1000 h, P<0.001), (ii) a high incidence of muscular strain during matches (23.2/1000 h) and (iii) a greater severity of injury in games than in regular training or camp situations (19.5 vs 8.4 vs 6.7 days, P<0.05). Despite the unique environmental, social and cultural setting in the Middle East, these findings are consistent with previous data from European football, suggesting that international guidelines on injury prevention and management may be applied in this region.

AB  - Two methods that can help to reduce the distances involved in transportation of cattle to slaughter are presented, route optimization and spatial redistribution of slaughter capacities. In a comparison of three route optimization techniques we show that RuttOpt is the most effective and that the number of stops on routes can be reduced compared to what is the case today. We also find that transport distances can be reduced by 40 % compared to the real transports of 2008 if animals are sent to the closest available facilities. We believe that the methods highlighted here can help improve the sustainability and animal health in both organic and conventional farming.

AB  - Seaweed cultivation and processing industries could contribute to sustainable blue growth and the European bioeconomy. This article contributes a case study evaluation of environmental sustainability of preserved brown seaweed Saccharina latissima by means of environmental life cycle assessment of a pilot facility in Sweden. The study accounts for nutrient bioremediation and carbon capture and includes two alternative hatchery processes, a 2-ha longline cultivation, and four alternative preservation methods (hang-drying outdoors, heated air-cabinet drying, ensiling, and freezing). The study found that as a result of carbon capture and nitrogen and phosphorus uptake (bioremediation) by seaweed, more CO2 and PO4 equivalents are (temporarily) absorbed than emitted by the supply chain. The extent of emissions is most affected by preservation methods undertaken. Impact profiles of the supply chain show that the greatest impact shares result from freezing and air-cabinet drying, both the two most energy-intensive processes, followed by the cultivation infrastructure, highlighting strategic optimization opportunities. Hatchery processes, harvesting, and the low-energy ensilage and hang-drying outdoors were found to have relatively small impact shares. These findings presage the environmentally friendliness of seaweed-based products by documenting their potential to mitigate eutrophication and climate change, even when taking a life cycle perspective.

AB  - Urban nature is and will be the most common provider of nature interactions for humankind. The restorative benefits of nature exposure are renown and creating human habitats that simultaneously support people's wellbeing and ecological sustainability is an urgent priority. In this study, we investigate how the relationship between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems influences restorative experiences combining a place-based online survey with geographical data on ecosystem health in Stockholm (Sweden). Using spatial regression, we predict the 544 restorative experiences (from 325 respondents), with people's environmental attitudes, natural land covers, ecosystem health, and the statistical interactions among these variables as predictors. Our results show that restorative experiences can happen anywhere in the urban landscape, but when they occur in natural environments, the combined levels of biodiversity and ecological connectivity are better predicting factor than the mere presence of nature. That is, healthy ecosystems seem to be more important than just any nature for restorative experiences. Moreover, the statistical interaction between one's environmental attitudes and natural environments predict almost all restorative experiences better than when these variables are independent predictors. This suggests that there is synergistic compatibility between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems that triggers restorative processes. We call this synergy regenerative compatibility. Regenerative compatibility is an unexploited potential that emerges when people's attitudes and ecosystems are aligned in sustainability. We consider regenerative compatibility a valuable leverage point to transform towards ecologically sustainable and healthy urban systems. To this end, we encourage multifaceted policy interventions that regenerate human-nature relationships holistically rather than implement atomistic solutions.

AB  - The commercial apple production in Norway is limited to the small regions along the fjords in the southwest part of the country and around lakes or near the sea in the southeast with favorable climate. Due to the rapid rate of climate change over the recent decades, it is expected that suitable heat conditions for apple growing will expand to the areas that were previously too cold. This study analyses the heat suitability of future climate (2021-2100) under the RCP8.5 scenario for 6 common apple varieties in Norway: Discovery, Gravenstein, Summerred, Aroma, Rubinstep and Elstar. Previously established heat requirement criteria (based on the temperature threshold for the full blooming and growing degree days sum between the full bloom and harvest) are applied to the temperature outputs of the regional climate models downscaled to 1 km resolution. The assessment indicates that as temperature rises, heat conditions suitable for cultivation of all 6 apple varieties will expand. According to the ensemble median value, areas with the favorable heat conditions for growing at least one of the considered apple varieties will increase 25 times in the period 2021-2040 and 60 times in the period 2041-2060, compared to the referent period 1971-2000. At the same time, areas suitable for all 6 apple varieties will increase 3 times in the first, and 3.8 times in the latter period. The favorable areas will advance from south and southeast northwards and inland in the eastern region, along the west and northwestern coastline towards higher latitudes, and along continental parts of fjords. The fastest expansion of heat suitable conditions is expected for Discovery and Gravenstein. The findings of this study are relevant for zoning apple production future potential and for strategical planning of climate change adaptation measures within the sector. Weather-related risks, such as risks from winter low temperatures, spring frost, drought and extreme precipitation were not considered.

AB  - Mixed forest ecosystems show effects of risk compensation similar to diversified portfolios of stocks. Other than portfolios of stocks, the composition of long-lived forests cannot be adjusted at short notice to current market developments. Thus, the financial robustness of tree-species portfolios is very important. However, it is still an open question, which financial approaches are appropriate to evaluate the financial robustness of mixed forests compared to single-species forests.
   This paper analysed various possibilities to assess portfolios of tree species, namely, the mean-variance (MV) approach applied for the selection of optimal portfolios, the second order stochastic dominance (SSD) criterion and the information-gap approach. For the numerical analysis existing financial data on Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were used which were generated by Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS) under risk.
   Regardless of the analysed approach, in all cases pure forests did not outperform mixed forests. The MV approach was restricted by the assumption of normally distributed financial returns. It had the tendency to favour larger proportions of the high-risk species Norway spruce. SSD was only able to distinguish between the efficient and the inefficient portfolios. It showed that forests with less than 20% (financial returns generated by MCS) or less than 30% (normally distributed financial returns) of Norway spruce were inefficient. Under information-gap modelling the advantages of risk compensation in mixed forests became clearest. Under the given assumptions, the financial robustness of a mixed forest (50% European beech and SO% Norway spruce) was between 4 and 18 times greater than that of pure Norway spruce.
   Modern information-gap modelling is very similar to the well known safety first rules and as such it is not that novel to financial optimisation as it seems at the first glance. Although the information-gap theory resulted in the same rankings as the minimisation of the estimated probability of failure, it nevertheless proved to be useful as a supplement to the other methods. Against the background of severe uncertainty inherent in long-term decision-making in forestry, information-gap modelling is based on appropriate assumptions. It favours a decision, which promises the greatest tolerance to possible errors in the available information, while still guaranteeing a minimal acceptable financial result. In principle, classical safety first rules do the same. However, the information-gap model is able to quantify the immunity of a decision against errors in the estimated financial data. From a theoretical point of view, this approach provides a supplementary and methodologically sound opportunity to incorporate severe uncertainty in decision-making. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is increasing interest in utilizing fishers' knowledge to better understand the marine environment, given the spatial extent and temporal resolution of fishing vessel operations. Furthermore, fishers' knowledge is part of the best available information needed for sustainable harvesting of stocks, marine spatial planning and large-scale monitoring of fishing activity. However, there are difficulties with integrating such information into advisory processes. Data is often not systematically collected in a structured manner and there are issues around sharing of information within the industry, and between industry and research partners. Decision support systems for fishing planning and routing can integrate relevant information in a systematic way, which both incentivizes vessels to share information beneficial to their operations and capture time sensitive big datasets for marine research. The project Fishguider has been developing such a web-based decision support tool since 2019, together with partners in the Norwegian fishing fleet. The objectives of the project are twofold: 1) To provide a tool which provides relevant model and observation data to skippers, thus supporting sustainable fishing activity. 2) To foster bidirectional information flow between research and fishing activity by transfer of salient knowledge (both experiential and data-driven), thereby supporting knowledge creation for research and advisory processes. Here we provide a conceptual framework of the tool, along with current status and developments, while outlining specific challenges faced. We also present experiential input from fishers' regarding what they consider important sources of information when actively fishing, and how this has guided the development of the tool. We also explore potential benefits of utilizing such experiential knowledge generally. Moreover, we detail how such collaborations between industry and research may rapidly produce extensive, structured datasets for research and input into management of stocks. Ultimately, we suggest that such decision support services will motivate fishing vessels to collect and share data, while the available data will foster increased research, improving the decision support tool itself and consequently knowledge of the oceans, its fish stocks and fishing activities.

AB  - In many industries it has become common to implement safety programmes aimed at improving safety behaviour and culture; however, in general little research has been conducted to understand the dynamics and causality of such programmes. This study sought to explore the effects of a large-scale safety programme implemented by a Norwegian petroleum company using a combined methodological approach; results from qualitative interviews and fieldworks were used to develop a hypothetical structural model tested on questionnaire data (n-1221) using structural equation modelling (SEM). Five theoretical concepts were validated before they were included in a hypothetical structural model: ( 1) participation in a two-day kickoff; ( 2) personal programme commitment; ( 3) effectiveness of programme implementation; ( 4) safety behaviour change; and ( 5) safety culture change. SEM indicated that the suggested structural model fitted the data, but two of the hypothesised structures were not significantly supported. Based on this, a modified version of the model was developed and estimated, resulting in a more robust model in which all hypothesised influences were supported. Results are discussed in light of the qualitative and quantitative results, programme characteristics, and previous research. This study demonstrates the significance of developing worker commitment to programme implementation and the importance of a comprehensive implementation of programme activities to increase the likelihood of cultural and behavioural effects concerning safety.

AB  - This article investigates how governmental agricultural R&D expenditure affect economic prosperity and sustainable development, attempting to verify the hypothesis that agricultural research and development expenditures are among the key factors influencing the farmers' income, as one of the sustainable development indicators. Statistical data were retrieved from European international databases for the period of 2004-2020 and were analyzed using the regression model. The results of the study indicate positive effects for most of the EU member states. The countries where the results validate the hypothesis are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Croatia, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom, as a former member state of the EU. Further, the model confirms that a significant portion of farmers' income growth is explained by the governmental R&D expenditure. These findings may change the methods and directions regarding the agricultural R&D expenditure, underpinning the macroeconomic policy and agriculture in rural areas along the pathway to achieving the sustainable development goals.

TI  - OpenMRG: Open data from Microwave links, Radar, and Gauges for rainfall quantification in Gothenburg, Sweden
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA

KW  - ERROR
AB  - Accurate rainfall monitoring is critical for sustainable societies and yet challenging in many ways. Opportunistic monitoring using commercial microwave links (CMLs) in telecommunication networks is emerging as a powerful complement to conventional gauges and weather radar. However, CML data are often inaccessible or incomplete, which limits research and application. Here, we aim to reduce this barrier by openly sharing data at 10 s resolution with true coordinates from a pilot study involving 364 bi-directional CMLs in Gothenburg, Sweden. To enable further comparative analyses, we also share high-resolution data from 11 precipitation gauges and the Swedish operational weather radar composite in the area. This article presents an overview of the data, including the collection approach, descriptive statistics, and a case study of a high-intensity event. The results show that the data collection was very successful, providing near-complete time series for the CMLs (99.99 %), gauges (100 %), and radar (99.6 %) in the study period (June-August 2015). The bandwidth consumed during CML data collection was small, and hence, the telecommunication traffic was not significantly affected by the collection. The gauge records indicate that total rainfall was approximately 260 mm in the study period, with rainfall occurring in 6 % of each 15 min interval. One of the most intense events was observed on 28 July 2015, during which the Torslanda gauge recorded a peak of 1.1 mmmin(-1). The variability in the CML data generally followed the gauge dynamics very well. Here we illustrate this for 28 July, where a nearby CML recorded a drop in received signal level of about 27 dB at the time of the peak. The radar data showed a good distribution of reflectivities for mostly stratiform precipitation but also contained some values above 40 dBZ, which is commonly seen as an approximate threshold for convective precipitation. Clutter was also found and was mostly prevalent around low reflectivities of -15 dBZ. The data are accessible at (Andersson et al., 2022). We believe this Open sharing of high-resolution data from Microwave links, Radar, and Gauges (OpenMRG) will facilitate research on microwave-based environmental monitoring using CMLs and support the development of multi-sensor merging algorithms.

AB  - Time series from an extensive research survey of juveniles of cod Gadus morhua, pollack Pollachius pollachius and whiting Merlangius merlangus sampled from 1919 to 1994 at 38 stations along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast were investigated. Spatial and temporal analyses were performed to study the spatial pattern of the temporal dynamics of the 3 fish species. Spatially consistent variations were detected in abundance, year-to-year fluctuation as well as in periodicity. The spatial heterogeneity occurred at a mesoscale (differences between fjords) and at a local scale (differences between stations within a fjord) for the 3 gadoids. However, the magnitude of the spatial heterogeneity differed between species. Cod and whiting, which were more abundant in sheltered areas, showed higher spatial variability than pollack, which was more abundant in exposed locations. In this way, the spatial pattern of abundance appeared to be linked to the scale of variability of the species. All 3 species exhibit periodic fluctuations of 2 to 2.5 yr in their optimal habitats, which probably resulted from intrinsic interactions in age-structured populations, such as density-dependent competition and cannibalism. In addition, all the species exhibited long-term trends possibly due to extrinsic forces, such as environmental changes or anthropogenic influences.

AB  - The mining industry is a common source of environmental metal emissions, which cause long-lasting effects in aquatic ecosystems. Metal risk assessment is challenging due to variations in metal distribution, speciation, and bioavailability. Therefore, seasonal effects must be better understood, especially in boreal regions in which seasonal changes are large. We sampled 4 Finnish lakes and sediments affected by mining for metals and geochemical characteristics in autumn and late winter, to evaluate seasonal changes in metal behavior, the importance of seasonality in risk assessment, and the sensitivity and suitability of different risk assessment methods. We compared metal concentrations in sediment, overlying water, and porewater against environmental quality guidelines (EQGs). We also evaluated the toxicity of metal mixtures using simultaneously extracted metals and an acid volatile sulfides (SEM-AVS) approach together with water quality criteria (US Environmental Protection Agency equilibrium partitioning benchmarks). Finally, site-specific risks for 3 metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) were assessed using 2 biotic ligand models (BLMs). The metal concentrations in the impacted lakes were elevated. During winter stratification, the hypolimnetic O-2 saturation levels were low (<6%) and the pH was acidic (3.5-6.5); however, abundant O-2 (>89%) and neutral pH (6.1-7.5) were found after the autumnal water overturn. Guidelines were the most conservative benchmark for showing an increased risk of toxicity in the all of the lakes. The situation remained stable between seasons. On the other hand, SEM-AVS, equilibrium partition sediment benchmarks (ESBs), and BLMs provided a clearer distinction between lakes and revealed a seasonal variation in risk among some of the lakes, which evidenced a higher risk during late winter. If a sediment risk assessment is based on the situation in the autumn, the overall risk may be underestimated. It is advisable to carry out sampling and risk assessment during periods in which metals are assumed to be the most environmentally harmful. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of China's diplomacy, specifically its transition from a peaceful and low-profile approach to the assertive and confrontational wolf warrior style, and its implications for international relations, regional politics, and global governance. With China's growing influence on the global stage, understanding the dynamics of its diplomatic strategy is crucial for navigating the complexities of contemporary international relations. The paper examines the underlying motivations for adopting the wolf warrior approach, using three case studies during the COVID-19 pandemic: the Twitter spat between Zhao Lijian and the U.S. State Department, the diplomatic conflict between China and Australia, and the confrontation between China and Sweden. These incidents provide valuable insights into the various dimensions of China's wolf warrior diplomacy, including its assertive rhetoric, challenge to traditional diplomatic norms, and the leveraging of economic power for political ends.

AB  - In the late 1970s, the construction of weirs in Norwegian regulated river systems for aesthetic reasons was common. However, today, the focus of river restoration has shifted towards improving biological functionality and biodiversity. In the present study, two weirs, originally built to create a stable water level, were removed on a residual flow reach in a Norwegian regulated river as a measure to restore river connectivity and to re-establish the local population of Atlantic salmon. The removal design was based on hydraulic modelling, and biological monitoring was implemented before and after the weir removal to evaluate the biological response to weir removal. The results demonstrated that salmon spawning sites were recreated in the old bed substratum and were occupied immediately the first season after weir removal, when water velocities increased to more suitable levels for spawning. Accordingly, mortality of Atlantic salmon eggs was reduced and the densities of juveniles showed a marked increase after weir removal. Conversely, pike and cyprinids in the reach were found in the samples before weir removal but not after removal, indicating that the desired shift in fish community in response to habitat alteration was obtained. Furthermore, enumeration of migrating adult salmon at a fishway upstream of the study reach showed that the migration peak, on average, was 1?month earlier in the 3?years after removal as compared with the 5?years before removal. Finally, the use of hydraulic modelling represented a useful method for designing physical habitat adjustments and assessing their influence on fish biology. The model results also supported a rapid process in planning and execution of construction works. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We used the Delphi method to assess possible outcomes of three scenarios based on the strength of mitigation policy. The scenarios scrutinised were (1) Baseline, (2) Tight Control and (3) Energy Plus Food. These scenarios create different adaptive needs and measures on farms. Baseline scenario follows the present and forthcoming development in agriculture and Tight Control scenario, in turn, constitutes all possible mitigation measures recently introduced in the scientific discussion. In Energy Plus Food scenario, farms increasingly produce renewable energy in addition to food and, therefore, have new opportunities to develop their businesses. The Delphi panel estimated how the farms would cope with different future developments represented by the scenarios. Based on our results, it is evident that interdisciplinary analysis in research and inter-sectoral cooperation between agricultural and energy policies are required.

AB  - Sustainable tree resource management is the key to mitigating climate warming, fostering a green economy, and protecting valuable habitats. Detailed knowledge about tree resources is a prerequisite for such management but is conventionally based on plot-scale data, which often neglects trees outside forests. Here, we present a deep learning-based framework that provides location, crown area, and height for individual overstory trees from aerial images at country scale. We apply the framework on data covering Denmark and show that large trees (stem diameter >10 cm) can be identified with a low bias (12.5%) and that trees outside forests contribute to 30% of the total tree cover, which is typically unrecognized in national inventories. The bias is high (46.6%) when our results are evaluated against all trees taller than 1.3 m, which involve undetectable small or understory trees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that only marginal effort is needed to transfer our framework to data from Finland, despite markedly dissimilar data sources. Our work lays the foundation for digitalized national databases, where large trees are spatially traceable and manageable.

AB  - 1. Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce (2013) and others to Adler et al.'s (2011) report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. (2011) argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding.
   2. Pierce (2013) disputes Adler et al.'s (2011) conclusion that bivariate productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) are 'weak and variable'. He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime 1979) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here, we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers.
   3. We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modelling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (i) clarifies possible hypotheses, (ii) permits explicit testing and (iii) provides more powerful and useful predictions.
   4. Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared with structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints.
   5. A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed-model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity-richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable.
   6. We urge ecologists to consider productivity-richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.

AB  - This paper presents an open-source spatial analysis model (Biomasfor) that can quantify the availability of forest wood-energy biomass in the light of ecological and economic sustainability. Several multi-functionality parameters were evaluated to highlight the potential impact of biomass extraction on different forest functions. The multistep approach used and the model's internal structure permit the use of the model with highly differentiated input datasets. The introduction of biomass demand evaluation allows the quantification of the wood-energy supply/demand. The analysis is focused on the province of Trento (northeastern Italian Alps). The results are based on a scenario evaluation characterised by several degrees of biomass extraction and by a sensitivity analysis of biomass price, as well as on a typology of mechanisation. The model outputs define a reduction in biomass availability with the introduction of technical, economic and multi-functionality parameters. Furthermore, considerations on territorial characteristics outline the importance of woodchip production as a means of avoiding carbon dioxide emissions and achieving low-impact reductions of the risk of fires. The model appears to be an effective tool in bioenergy planning, particularly for the following purposes: (i) the estimation of the biomass supply/demand ratio under different scenarios; (ii) a preliminary analysis of biomass quality; and (iii) the influence of local environmental, economic and logistical characteristics on biomass production.

AB  - We are currently witnessing significant global changes in climate conditions. We cannot change the natural conditions, but with regard to sustainable landscape management, we can increase our knowledge of tree species and adapt forest management to them. Surprisingly, one of the most affected tree species in Central Europe today is Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The following literature review summarizes over 200 studies from 1952-2022 regarding Scots pine across its entire range while addressing various topics in the ecology and management of this taxon. It is a tree species with a large natural range, nearly covering the entire Eurasian area. In the Czech Republic, it is the second most important tree species in terms of industrial wood production. Scots pine is characterized not only by a significant genetic variability of its populations but also by its wide ecological plasticity. Typically, it grows on sandy soils, poor habitats, and stony scree-but also in peat bogs. The wide habitat valence justifies the economic significance of this species, both in terms of its high production potential (mean annual increment of up to 10.8 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)) but also its wide range of use. However, in the light of climate variations, the practices of Scots pine silviculture are also gradually transforming from the traditional reforestation by clear-cutting to a more natural system-shelterwood felling. In view of climate change, its range of distribution is changing, as with other species, but Scots pine remains a very resistant tree species, depending on the habitat.

AB  - An increasing number of researchers stress the importance of national planning institutions' role with respect to promoting an "effective" decision-making process in terms of bringing about sustainable energy. Impact assessment (IA) procedures are seen as having strong potential in supporting environmentally conscious energy production. This article discusses criteria for sustainable wind power planning and compares the centralised planning systems for wind energy in two countries - Norway and Scotland - as illustrating cases. We ask the following: What key criteria should be present to secure sustainable wind energy planning, and what are the critical institutional conditions to fulfil these criteria? A review of relevant IA literature reveals four key criteria for promoting sustainable wind planning: (i) clear and integrated political priorities, (ii) stakeholder involvement, (iii) strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and (iv) stringent permission and assessment requirements. We also determined that critical institutional 'conditions exist that effectively promote sustainable energy production: (a) coordinated energy policy institutions, (b) legitimate planning procedures, (c) that SEAS are followed in the decision-making process and (d) statutory planning regulations.

AB  - Mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa is the main treeline species in northern Europe, and the recent increase in treeline elevation in Fennoscandia due to climate change and land use has made mountain birch an important bioindicator. Birch seedlings from 10 populations were therefore transplanted to 3 northern Fennoscandian sites (1 oceanic, 1 continental mountain and 1 Arctic coastal site). Annual measurements were carried out on growth parameters and phenology (date of budbreak) from 1992 onwards. At the coastal site, measurements covered the whole period 1993 to 2010, while at the 2 other sites measurements covered only the period 1993 to 1997 (mountain site) and 2010 to 2014 (both sites). During the last period (2010 to 2014), measurements were made on a new set of seedlings, transplanted in 2002. The plants suffered a temporary transplantation stress because of root damage. In general, budburst occurred earlier in populations from northern and continental sites than from southern and coastal sites. Survival rates were dependent on climate and were generally higher at the oceanic than at the mountain site, due to more autumn frost and insect damage at the latter. At the mountain site, survival rates were lowest in oceanic and southern populations; at the Arctic site, survival rates were lowest in continental populations; while at the oceanic site, only small differences were found between populations. The present results seem to indicate that climate is an important driver of change at the mountain birch treeline, although land-use changes may be more important in the short term. In the future, when a warmer climate is predicted, plants that are adapted to a coastal climate may expand their range, and increased winter temperatures are expected to favour insect-resistant polycormic birch inbreeding with dwarf birch Betula nana.

AB  - Sediments polluted by historical emissions from anthropogenic point sources are common in industrialized parts of the world and pose a potential threat to the function of aquatic ecosystems. Gradient studies using fish as a bioindicator are an option to assess the ecological impact of locally polluted areas. This study investigates the remaining effects of historical emissions on sediments outside ten Swedish pulp and paper mills using perch (Perca fluviatilis). The aim has been to obtain a general picture of the impact area of local deposits of cellulose fiber-rich sediments containing elevated levels of trace metals, e.g., Hg, and organochlorines, e.g., dioxins. In addition to analyzing contaminant levels in muscle and liver tissue, morphological measures in the fish that constitute biomarkers for health and reproductivity were measured. Another aim was to augment existing historical data sets to observe possible signs of environmental recovery. Overall, the results indicate only a minor elevation in contaminant levels and a minor impact on the fish health status in the polluted areas, which in several cases is an improvement from historical conditions. However, exceptions exist. Differences in the ecosystems' responses to pollution loads are primarily explained by abiotic factors such as water turnover rate, bottom dynamic conditions, and water chemistry. Weaknesses in the sampling methodology and processing of data were identified. After minor modifications, the applied survey strategy has the potential to be a management tool for decision-makers working on the remediation of contaminated areas.

AB  - The decline in emergent reed beds in eutrophic shallow lakes in Europe has been linked to multiple factors, such as adverse water and sediment quality, shoreline development and fixed water level preventing recolonisation, recreational disturbances and herbivory by geese and muskrat. This study analyses the relative importance of these factors in a historical context and tests experimentally what currently may prevent the re-establishment of emergent reed beds. We examined the historical extent of emergent reed stands (1925-2013) in relation to long-term time series of lakeside housing development (1920-2013), abundance of greylag geese (Anser anser) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) as well as water quality (1977-2013) for the shallow lowland peat lake district of Reeuwijk in The Netherlands. In addition, we carried out a comparative survey to generalise our results and an exclosure experiment to test whether current muskrat grazing pressure may hamper restoration efforts. A steady, linear decline in the extent of emergent reed beds over time corresponded significantly with a similar increase in lakeside house density. We found no correlation with herbivore stocks or water quality parameters. In the exclosures, rapid expansion of common reed (Phragmites australis), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum) and submerged pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) occurred, suggesting muskrat herbivory as a factor-limiting emergent reed re-establishment in the foreshore. A combined understanding of the different roles of slow, long-term pressures (such as housing development) and present constraints (the continuous grazing pressure by muskrat despite a culling program) is crucial to the successful restoration of reed beds in shallow lakes.

AB  - The increasing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow down climate change requires more effective and versatile methods for producing energy. In Finland, common reed and forest biomass are used for energy production. There are efforts to increase the utilisation of renewable energy resources. The potential intensification of renewables utilisation may result in changes to the landscape's structure and functions. The objective of this study was to develop a method for energy biomass mapping in landscapes using high-resolution remote sensing data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The images were obtained from UAVs in Ojalahti, Lipperi, Finland, and a point cloud was calculated from the overlapped images. Individual plants were automatically identified using object-oriented image processing. The size of the individual plants was measured from orthophotographs and the point cloud. It was possible to develop an accurate three-dimensional model of the biomass distribution within the landscape. The error in height measurements of common reed plants and forest trees was 0.044 m. The root-mean-square deviation in common reed biomass measurements using the UAV data obtained was 0.096 m(3). The new method developed in this study could be used as a cost-effective solution for common reed biomass resources assessment. This would allow for the mobilisation of common reed biomass for sustainable energy production.

AB  - The bulk of the erosion and phosphorus (P) loading from agriculture to surface waters originates in Finland outside the growing season. The annual loading starts after the harvest in autumn and increases cumulatively during winter and spring, while loading during summer remains low. In terms of loading, the condition in which the fields remain after the growing season is crucial. When the (i) the tillage intensity is reduced, (ii) the tillage date is postponed till next spring, or (iii) when the cultivation practice is changed from tillage to no-tillage, the field surface begins to increasingly resemble a permanent crop cover and, consequently, both erosion and particulate P loading strongly decrease when compared with intensive autumnal tillage. On the other hand, the loading of dissolved P tends to increase in such a transition. The effect of annual hydrological variation on the loading is substantial. The suspended solids and particulate P concentrations may double in hydrologically disadvantageous (wet autumn followed by mild and rainy winter) years, thus greatly increasing the erosion and phosphor-us loading when compared with "normal" years. A possible increase in runoff will further increase the difference. The levels of suspended solids and particulate P concentrations in fields under permanent crop cover are, particularly during hydrologically disadvantageous years, substantially lower than in fields under intensive tillage. The dissolved P concentrations showed minor variation and remained at their characteristic level regardless of hydrological year or tillage treatment. The annual distribution of loading was similar at the catchment and field scales. The differences among the flow-weighted annual mean concentrations of suspended solids and particulate P tended to strongly even out when the runoff waters from fields were mixed with those from the parts of the catchment with other land-uses. At catchment- scale, it seems that the increase in total runoff rather than in concentrations govern the increases in total loading. The catchment-scale phenomena may, however, cause misconceptions about the character of the loading from fields and the possibilities of mitigation. While it is possible to efficiently reduce the loading from fields, the gained benefit is hard to prove on the base of catchment-scale measurements and, moreover, it often disappears in the variation caused by hydrological conditions. This will pose major challenges for the mitigation measures in a warmer future climate, particularly if the autumn and winter precipitation will increase and the winters will turn milder.

AB  - Boreal forests are sensitive to climatic warming, because low temperatures hold back ecosystem processes, such as the mobilization of nitrogen in soils. A greening of the boreal landscape has been observed using remote sensing, and the seasonal amplitude of CO2 in the northern hemisphere has increased, indicating warming effects on ecosystem productivity. However, field observations on responses of ecosystem productivity have been lacking on a large sub-biome scale. Here we report a significant increase in the annual growth of boreal forests in Finland in response to climatic warming, especially since 1990. This finding is obtained by linking meteorological records and forest inventory data on an area between 60 degrees and 70 degrees northern latitude. An additional increase in growth has occurred in response to changes in other drivers, such as forest management, nitrogen deposition and/or CO2 concentration. A similar warming impact can be expected in the entire boreal zone, where warming takes place. Given the large size of the boreal biome - more than ten million km 2 - important climate feedbacks are at stake, such as the future carbon balance, transpiration and albedo.

AB  - Purpose The study identifies the variation of change strategies used in a complex large scale change program in health and social services in Sweden, aimed at changing professionals' health promoting practices. The purpose is to investigate the change strategies used over time and describe the potential variation in key change agent views, using a framework inspired by De Caluwe and Vermaak's multi paradigm change typology.
   Design/methodology/approach - The first six years of the regional multi-sector program are examined. Results are based on content analyses of interviews with key change actors, and archival data describing program activities. Respondents belonged to either the strategic or the operational program management team, representing different sectors of health and social services in a region.
   Findings - Multiple strategy paradigms showed varying influence over the program's different phases, partly due to program progress, change agent influence and/or varying contextual demands. Respondents' views on strategies and program focus varied depending on their program roles. Respondents expressed insights about the varying conditions for change and on the conflicting expectations within and between program management teams.
   Originality/value - This study introduces the application of a new framework on a large scale, complex change program. The framework sheds light on a number of basic assumptions and change strategies that can be further compared with content and context factors, barriers, facilitators, outcomes, and in turn with other programs.

AB  - At many levels of society-in regions, corporations, and among citizens-awareness is increasing, and actions towards more sustainable energy are being taken. The key drivers of this transition have been climate change, the scarcity of resources, and environmental consciousness. The speed of change and its impacts on the energy system transition are still unknown. It is therefore important to anticipate probable, preferable, or avoidable future paths that will contribute to the discussion of the direction and conditions of such futures. In this article, five energy scenarios are presented for Finland until 2030. The scenarios are based on a two-round Delphi application, in which energy experts were first interviewed and then a survey phase was conducted. We used cluster analysis to construct the scenarios and arranged the responses to open-ended questions as narratives to deepen the scenarios. Based on the cluster analysis, five clusters were constructed, namely, (1) business as usual, (2) energy saving and decarbonisation, (3) climate-friendly transformation, (4) green growth, and (5) degrowth. These scenarios illustrate how varying sets of drivers of change in society, and a set of energy policy measures, are connected with energy futures. Expert information thus organised can be used to advise policymakers when designing future climate and energy policy.

AB  - Aim Available theories suggest that the species number increases with island size, but the relationship between island size and species density, the number of species per unit area, is less understood. Moreover, mechanisms connecting island size and species density are not always evident because small and large islands differ in physical characteristics other than island size. The purpose here was to disentangle direct and indirect effects of island size and wave exposure on the species density of arthropods from herb-dominated shore habitats.
   Location Islands in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden.
   Taxon Spiders (Araneae) and beetles (Coleoptera).
   Methods We collected spiders and beetles on vegetated shores on islands of varying sizes, and used structural equation models to disentangle direct and indirect island size and wave exposure effects on species density.
   Results Island size affected diversity of web-building spiders, predatory beetles and other beetles (detritivores and omnivores), direct and indirectly. Indirect effects arose because large islands have more trees and steeper slopes than small islands, both of which affected species occurrence. Because height above the sea level reduces the effect of wave exposure, there were effects of these variables on the forest cover and on the diversity of web-building spiders. Finally, surrounding forest cover and diversity of flowering plants within sites increased diversity of herbivore beetles and cursorial spiders, likely because these sites provide more diverse resources.
   Main conclusions The result that predictors for species density vary between functional groups, with mechanisms that may or may not relate to island size, suggest potential developments in island biogeography theories. Future studies of island size effects should also attempt to quantify indirect effects, and not only total effects.

AB  - The microbial control agent Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) has been successfully used worldwide to reduce abundances of biting Nematocera (Diptera), often with little direct impact on non-target organisms observed. However, the potential for additional indirect effects on other ecosystem properties, including on trophic linkages within food webs, is poorly known. We investigated the effects of multiple-year mosquito control treatments using the Bti product VectoBac((R))-G on the stable isotope composition of epigeal and soil-based consumers inhabiting replicate floodplains along the River Dalalven, Sweden. We observed significant changes in the isotopic composition of detritivores feeding at the base of floodplain food webs. Enchytraeid worms were characterised by 3.5% higher delta C-13 values in treated floodplains, suggesting increased consumption of delta C-13-enriched food. The overall range of community-wide delta N-15 values was 56% greater in the treated floodplains, whilst delta N-15 values of oribatid mites were elevated by 97%. These results suggest extra fractionation in the transfer of nitrogen through floodplain food chains. We conjecture that the ecological mechanisms driving these food web shifts are (1) the mass mortality of high delta C-13 A. sticticus larvae, which leaves high concentrations of dead mosquito biomass deposited on soils at local scales, after the floodwaters have receded and (2) incorporation of the very high delta C-13-enriched corn particles comprising the bulk of the VectoBac((R))-G product into floodplain food webs. Our results suggest that repeated applications of Bti might have wider, still largely unknown implications for nutrient and energy cycles within floodplain ecosystems.

AB  - Animal husbandry contributes to roughly 15% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions, of which the majority originates from methane emissions associated with ruminant enteric fermentation. Recent studies have shown that methane emissions from ruminants can be heavily reduced (up to 90% reduction) by introducing the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis in the feed composition. The largest hurdle in implementing a wider use of the seaweed feed supplement is to scale up the production. Today most of the production is performed in extensive ocean farming systems. In the small coastal city Lysekil, located on the Swedish west coast, an initiative for a land-based seaweed production system is currently in progress. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to assess the environmental impact of this production system. The assessment included all important stages in the seaweed production system, from cradle to farmgate. The results showed that a large part of the assessed impacts were attributed to the salt (NaCl) sourcing needed to increase the salinity to achieve optimal growing conditions. In the default scenario, the salt input contributed to 48% of the total GHG emissions. The scenario analysis showed that lower emissions could be obtained by changing the salt source from rock salt, sourced in Denmark, to sea salt sourced by using evaporation ponds in France. Moreover, increasing the water recycling rate could reduce salt demand and consequently the environmental impact. The results also displayed a large thermal energy demand used to increase the temperature in the water to more fitting conditions. Despite this, the environmental impact from thermal energy was relatively low, causing 16% of the total GHG emissions. The reason for this was explained by the use of low-impact district heating, mostly reliant on the excess heat from the local oil refinery. The scenario analysis showed that choices regarding thermal energy source and allocation method significantly impacted the overall results of the assessment. Furthermore, we argue that although the environmental impact from the excess heat from the oil refinery displayed low impact, the seaweed farm should consider using other thermal energy sources, since it is difficult to foresee the impact of the excess heat from the petrochemical industry as its main products are being phased out in decarbonization and climate neutrality schemes. An alternative thermal energy source with promising results was electric heat pumps powered by wind. We concluded that LCA methodology could be an important tool to optimize production systems before they are brought into operation.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose The study seeks to shed light on the generative principles of enterprising by examining the practices of enterprisers in six lifestyle enterprises in Sweden. It presents a fresh approach to the study of lifestyle enterprises, resolving a nuanced treatment of the concepts of capital and habitus as often drawn upon in studies using the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a grounded theory approach to examine enterprising practices in six lifestyle enterprises in Sweden. Study materials are derived principally from ethnographic observations and active interviews. The analytical procedure follows that of grounded theory, the analysis proceeding from the first field contacts and developing iteratively as the corpus expanded, with empirical themes giving way to formative concepts and sensitizing to the theoretical architecture of Pierre Bourdieu. Findings The findings offer insights into lifestyle enterprising, revealing how resourcing practices of capital deployment give shape to its practice. The findings reveal that capital deployment practices are not simply about conversion but may also involve practices, without substantive change to capital forms. Furthermore, the findings highlight that habitus significantly influences capital deployment practices. Research limitations/implications - Although the findings are limited to the study context, the study offers theoretical implications for study of enterprising. One is to highlight the importance of cultural capital in enterprising practices. Another is to highlight the variable construction of capitals, arising in connection to habitus. In pointing to the central generative role of habitus, the study suggests that cultural capital may underpin the formation of social capital. Overall, the findings indicate that researchers need to consider the mediating effects of habitus when investigating enterprising practices. More widely, this study responds and lends weight to, recent calls for more holistic and integrated treatments using Bourdieu's theory to further understandings of entrepreneurship as practice. Practical implications - This study offers implications for policy relating to enterprising practice. In particular, findings suggest that it might be wise to consider the alignment of habitus between those who provide and receive support, or in other words, having providers with the right cultural competence to offer useful help. It may be important for policy agents to be able to relate to the worldviews of those they seek to support. Originality/value The study directly responds to recent calls for more holistic and integrated approaches to the nascent line of inquiry using Bourdieu's theory to gain insight into entrepreneurship as a practice, particularly in relation to the undertheorized phenomenon of lifestyle entrepreneurship. In doing so, the study serves to advance the practice-oriented conceptualization of lifestyle entrepreneurship as lifestyle entrepreneuring. The paper also offers a conceptual framework to assist researchers investigating enterprising practice.

TI  - RENEWABLE ENERGY AT SUSTAINABLE COST USING A COMBINED HEAT AND POWER WTE-FACILITY IN THE PAPER INDUSTRY
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN WASTE TO ENERGY CONFERENCE

CP  - ASME 18th Annual North American Waste to Energy Conference
AB  - In March 2008, Keppel Seghers started the engineering, supply, construction and commissioning of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant in Amotfors (Sweden). When completed in 2010 the plant will process close to 74,000 tons per year of household waste (average LHV = 10.5 MJ/kg) and limited quantities of (demolition) wood resulting in a yearly production of about 108,700 MWh of steam, 12,100 MWh of heat and 13,400 MWh of electricity. Herewith, the Amotfors WtE-CHP is sized to meet the joined energy needs of the local paper production, neighboring industries and buildings at an overall net plant efficiency of almost 65%.
   The WtE-CHP will offer state-of-the-art combustion and energy recovering technology, featuring Keppel Seghers' proprietary Air-Cooled Grate, SIGMA combustion control and integrated boiler. Waste is fed into the combustion line with an automatic crane system. To surpass the stringent EU emission requirements, a semi-dry flue gas cleaning system equipped with Keppel Seghers' Rotary Atomizer was selected as economic type of process for purifying the combustion gas from the given waste mixture. Furthermore a low NOx-emission of 135 mg/Nm(3) (11%O2,dry) as imposed by Swedish law is achieved by SNCR.
   The plant engineering is described with a focus on the overall energy recovery. As stable steam supply to the paper mill and the district heating system needs to be assured under all conditions the design includes for supporting process measures such as combustion air preheating, steam accumulation, turbine bypassing, buffering of the main condenser and back-up energy supply from an auxiliary fuel boiler. Additionally, external conditions can trigger distinct plant operation modes. A selected number of them are elaborated featuring the WtE-plant's capability to conciliate a strong fluctuating steam demand with the typical intrinsic inertia of a waste-fired boiler.
   With prices for fossil fuels increasing over the years, the cost for generating process steam and heat has become dominant and for paper mills even makes the overall difference in viability. As will be documented in this paper, the decision to build the Amotfors WtE-CHP was taken by Nordic Paper after a quest for significant cost-cutting in the production of process energy. Moreover, the use of industrial and household waste as fuel brings along the advantage of becoming largely independent from evolutions on the international oil and gas markets. By opening up the possibility for a long-term secured local (waste) fuel supply at fixed rates, WtE-technology offers a reliable alternative to maintain locally based industrial production sites. The Nordic Paper mills in Amotfors are therefore now the first in Sweden to include a waste-fired CHP on a paper production site.

AB  - Aiming for sustainable development of food value chains several assessment methods arc developed, however it seems challenging to go from assessment to actual change. A solution proposed is increased stakeholder involvement also in the assessment phase. The perspective on sustainability varies depending on several variables, among which the geographical context where the producers are located. The perspective of the latter is of paramount importance as these are the actors on who, ultimately, possible changes towards sustainability depend. In this article, we applied a qualitative approach to investigate the farmers' perspective on sustainability, in the horticultural production in Arctic Norway. We found that many of the premises for sustainable food production are present. The main challenges are lack of long-term planning, dependency of rented land as well as fluctuating yield and income. Producer's network is essential for development as well as introduction of technical improvements. The study shows the importance of contextualisation of sustainability, as well as pointing at concerns about trade-offs between sustainability dimensions and themes in the proposed model. The research contributes to method development by demonstrating how a qualitative approach is a fruitful method to unravel the complexities of sustainability in food production.

AB  - Arable weeds are generally distributed in patches, while herbicides are applied uniformly. Herbicides can be saved if only the patches are sprayed, i.e. patch spraying (PS). Bottlenecks for cost-effective PS are weed monitoring technology and valid technology-based decision rules for PS (thresholds). The novel machine vision algorithm Weedcer has been developed as an efficient weed monitoring tool for PS. Weedcer estimates the proportions of young weed leaves and cereal leaves in high resolution red-green-blue images. We conducted field trials to test relative weed cover (RWC) and relative mayweed cover (RMC) estimated by Weedcer as decision rules for PS. RWC is the total weed cover divided by the total plant cover and RMC is the mayweed cover divided by the total plant cover. The main criterion for evaluation and basis of these thresholds was the measured grain yield. Images (about 0.06-m(2)) were acquired with a GPS guided autonomous field robot in spring, the normal time for spraying seed-propagated broadleaf weeds in both winter - and spring cereals in Norway. Three map-based trials (weed monitoring and spraying in two separate operations) showed that mean RWC per management unit (12.0 x 12.5-m) was generally adequate. In winter wheat heavily infested with scentless mayweed (Tripleurospermum inodorum (L) Sch.Bip.) and/or scented mayweed (Matricaria recutita L.), the mean RMC per management unit was more adequate. Progress during the project allowed three additional trials conducted in real-time (weed monitoring and spraying in the same operation). These were conducted with the robot in spring cereals, and showed that a weighted moving average of RWC per image was adequate. The sprayed and unsprayed management units in these trials were minimum 3.0 x 3.0-m and 0.5 x 3.0-m, respectively. Results indicated that the Weedcer-based thresholds should be lower in wheat (Triticum aestivum) than in barley.(Hordeum vulgare). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emissions of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, need to be greatly reduced to avoid the risk of a harmful climate change. One powerful way to mitigate emissions is to switch fuels from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as biomass. In this paper, we systematically investigate several bioenergy processing options, quantify the reduction rate and calculate the specific cost of reduction. This paper addresses the issue of which option Sweden should concentrate on to achieve the largest CO2 reduction at the lowest cost. The results show that the largest and most long-term sustainable CO2 reduction would be achieved by refining the woody biomass to fuel pellets for coal substitution, which have been done in Sweden. Refining to motor fuels, such as methanol, DME and ethanol, gives only half of the reduction and furthermore at a higher specific cost. Biomass refining into pellets enables transportation over long distances and seasonal storage, which is crucial for further utilisation of the woody biomass potential. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fine-scale spatial patterns of trees and their interactions are of paramount importance for controlling the structure and function of forest ecosystems; however, few management techniques can be employed to adjust the structural characteristics of uneven-aged mixed forests. This research provides an accurate, efficient, and impersonal comprehensive thinning index (P-index) for selecting candidate harvesting trees; the index was proposed by weighting the commonly used quantitative indices with respect to stand fine-scale structures, competition status, tree vigor, and tree stability. The applications of the proposed P-index in evaluating and simulating the process of thinning operations were examined using four 1-ha mapped plots with different forest types, namely, natural secondary forest, natural pine-broadleaved mixed forest, natural larch-birch mixed forest, and natural oak forest, which were widely distributed across the Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China. The results indicated that the proposed P-index could effectively affect the structural differentiations between different forest types and alternative thinning intensities. The marginal benefits of alternative thinning intensities on the integrated forest structure indicated that removing 10% of the trees from the plots might be the optimal thinning intensity from the perspective of optimizing stand structure, in which the P-index values could be increased by approximately 5%-11% for the four tested plots. The main conclusion from this paper was that the proposed P-index could be used as a quantitative tool to manage uneven-aged mixed forests.

AB  - The situation resulting from the Chernobyl fallout in 1987 was compared to that in 2000-2001 in Finland and NW Russia and that in 2003 in the Baltic countries. 786 humus (0-3 cm layer) samples were collected during 2000-2001 in the Barents Ecogeochemistry Project, and 177 samples in the Baltic countries in 2003. Nuclides emitting gamma-radiation in the 0-3 cm humus layer were measured by the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority-STUK in Finland.
   In 1987 the project area was classified by the European Commission into four different fallout classes. Cs-137 inventory Bg/m(2) levels measured in 2000-2003 were compared to the EU's class ranges. Fitting over the whole project area was implemented by generalizing the results for samples from the Baltic countries, for which Bq/m(2) inventories could be calculated. A rough estimation was made by comparing the mass of organic matter and humus with (CS)-C-137 concentrations in these two areas. Changes in (CS)-C-137 concentration levels are illustrated in both thematic maps and tables.
   Radionuclide (CS)-C-137 concentrations (Bq/kg d.w.) were detected in the humus layer at all the 988 sampling sites. Cs-134 was still present in 198 sites 15 years after the nuclear accident in Chernobyl. No other anthropogenic nuclides emitting gamma-radiation were detected, but low levels of Co-60, Sb-125 and Eu-154 isotopes were found in 14 sites. Fifteen years after the Chernobyl accident, the radioactive nuclide Cs-137 was and still is the most significant fallout radionuclide in the environment and in food chains. The results show that the fallout can still be detected in the uppermost humus layer in North East Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) occurred rarely at submountain alti-tudes before reaching its present position as the most important economic tree species in Central Europe. Spruce cultivation outside of natural sites is under constant threat from harmful agents. In this study, we focused on the indication of potentially suitable planting sites for Norway spruce in areas of protected submountain (< 700 m a.s.l) populations using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of soil properties in oak-beech, mixed and spruce stands in the territory of the Czech Republic. The soil A-horizon properties in mixed stands were more similar to those in spruce than in broadleaved stands; stand mix-tures resulted in lower soil property separability than the localization of indi-vidual populations (57% and 85%, respectively). The suitable sites were de-fined by acid phosphomonoesterase > 151 & mu;g hour-1, soil porosity > 63%, aera-tion > 53%, bulk density < 0.86 g cm-3, cation exchange capacity < 18 cmol+ kg-1, Corg< 9% and Ntot< 0.5% in clusters comprising the Bohemian highlands, North Bohemian rock cities and the Outer Western Carpathians. The LDA of soil properties offered a useful tool for assessing both naturalness and forest threats to support sustainable management.

AB  - In the Finnish sawmill industry, inter-firm collaboration has often been brought up as a means of creating a competitive edge in global markets by achieving economies of scale. According to the resource-based view (RBV), a firm can evaluate its current or potential partners by considering firm-level collaboration as a portfolio of complementary strategic resources. The specific focus of the study is on examining the types and forms of sawmill co-operation, how the co-operation emerged and which firm-specific resources are mainly related to cooperation. Based upon this, we can see how the managers of medium-sized sawmills perceive network co-operation as facilitating the achievement of a sustainable competitive advantage. The empirical data for this study were collected by interviewing 16 managers and employees in medium-sized non-integrated sawmills, a joint-venture marketing company and other cooperative partners. The findings of the study show that meaningful and beneficial co-operation partnerships exist in the Finnish sawmilling industry, but the sawmill managers do not perceive this collaboration as a strategic resource. The marketing company was the only firm in this study that relied on its co-operative networks in seeking a sustainable competitive advantage. To make more of co-operative partnerships, the principles of co-operative networking should be understood better in the sawmilling industry in order to know what to expect from cooperation. Furthermore, the managers should have the courage to engage in more extensive co-operation in order for strategic rents to materialize. Since the selection of the right partners is fundamental, further studies could be conducted on the reasons behind failed or terminated co-operative arrangements to gather further empirical knowledge in this subject area.

AB  - This paper investigates options for highly efficient SOFC hybrid systems of different sizes. For this purpose different models of pressurised SOFC hybrids systems have been developed in the framework of the European Project "LARGE SOFC - Towards a Large SOFC Power Plant". This project, coordinated by VTT Finland, counts numerous industrial partners such as Wartsila, Topsoe and Rolls-Royce FCS ltd.
   Starting from the RRFCS Hybrid System [1], considered as the reference case, several plant modifications have been investigated in order to improve the thermodynamic efficiency. The main options considered are (i) the integration of a recuperated micro gas turbine and (ii) the replacement of the cathodic ejector with a blower.
   The plant layouts are analysed in order to define the optimum solution in terms of operating parameters and thermodynamic performances
   The study of a large size power plant (around 110 MW,) fed by coal and incorporated with SOFC hybrid systems is also conducted. The aim of this study is to analyse the sustainability of an Integrated Gasification Hybrid System from the thermodynamic and economic point of view in the frame of future large sized power generation.
   A complete thermoeconomic analysis of the most promising plants is carried out, taking into account variable and capital costs of the systems. The designed systems are compared from the thermodynamic and the thermoeconomic point of view with some of the common technologies used for distributed generation (gas turbines and reciprocating engines) and large size power generation (combined cycles and IGCC).
   The tool used for this analysis is WTEMP software, developed by the University of Genoa (DIMSET-TPG) [2], able to carry out a detailed thermodynamic and thermocconomic analysis of the whole plants.

AB  - Reliable data on SOC stocks in forest soils is required in the context of climate change and soil health assessments but still limited by input data availability (e.g., bulk density) and methods used for stock calculation. Relatively few studies have investigated the stability of SOC in forest soils. We investigated SOC stocks and fractionation in soils beneath Norway spruce forests and grasslands in the montane zone along a gradient of mean annual precipitation (MAP). We sampled soil cores volumetrically to 40 cm depth and measured SOC in the fractions <2 mm (fine earth), >200 mu m and 200-20 mu m (coarse and fine POM), and <20 mu m (MAOM) along with potential pedogenic controls. Total SOC stocks beneath forests in the study region, calculated by the equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach to 40 cm depth, amount to 79.0 +/- 29.9 (mean +/- standard deviation) Mg ha(-1) (n = 20) in the mineral soil, and to 92.9 +/- 30.6 Mg ha(-1) including the litter layer, with a share of 55 % associated with POM. MAOM makes up similar to 41 % of SOC in the uppermost mineral layer (0-5 cm) and increases to 71 % in the subsoil (20-40 cm). Multiple regression models show that MAOM is largely controlled by ammonium oxalate extractable Al (Al-o) in the forest subsoils (20-40 cm), and increases with MAP in the topsoil layers (0-20 cm). Soils on carbonate rock stand out with similar to 80-100 % larger shares of MAOM in the uppermost soil layers (0-10 cm) which is likely connected to higher soil pH and MAP, supporting microbial transformation and subsequent stabilisation of organic matter, which is reflected in narrower C:N ratios in MAOM and SOC.
   Including the litter layers, ESM-based total SOC stocks in forest soils tend to exceed those beneath grassland (80.2 +/- 21.9 Mg ha(-1); n = 31) by 16 %, but only by 6.4 % if calculated by the conventional fixed-depth (FD) approach. In contrast to the forest soils, SOC stocks beneath grasslands are dominated by MAOM (75.6 %).
   We conclude that (coniferous) forest soils are a poor reference for establishing sequestration potentials for stable SOC. The observed large proportion of POM in forest topsoils and its increase with declining MAP (indicating water availability) suggests a risk of SOC losses in response to increasing droughts due to climate change.

AB  - The frequency, strength and sources of long-range transport (LRT) episodes of fine particles (PM(2.5)) were studied in southern Finland using air quality monitoring results, backward air mass trajectories, remote sensing of fire hot spots, transport and dispersion modelling of smoke and chemical analysis of particle samples (black carbon, monosaccharide anhydrides, oxalate, succinate, malonate, SO(2)(-), NO(3)(-), K(+) and NH(4)(+)). At an urban background site in Helsinki, the daily WHO guideline value (24-h PM(2.5) mean 25 mu g m(-3)) was exceeded during 1-7 LRT episodes per year in 1999-2007. The 24-h mean maximum concentrations varied between 25 and 49 mu g m(-3) during the episodes, which was 3-6 times higher than the local mean concentration (8.7 mu g m(-3)) in 1999-2007. The highest particle concentrations (max. 1-h mean 163 mu g m(-3)) and the longest episodes (max. 9 days) were mainly caused by the emissions from open biomass burning, especially during springs and late-summers in 2002 and 2006. During the period 2001-2007, the satellite remote sensing of active fire hot spots and transport and dispersion modelling of smoke indicated that approximately half of the episodes were caused partly by the emissions from wildfires and/or agricultural waste burning in fields in Eastern Europe, especially in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Other episodes were mainly caused by the LRT of ordinary anthropogenic pollutants, e.g. from energy production, traffic, industry and wood combustion. During those 'other episodes', air masses also arrived from Eastern Europe, including Poland. The highest concentrations of biomass-burning tracers, such as monosaccharide anhydrides (levoglucosan + mannosan + galactosan) and K+, were observed during open biomass-burning episodes, but quite high values were also measured during some winter episodes due to wood combustion emissions. Our results indicate that open biomass burning in Eastern Europe causes high fine particle concentration peaks in large areas of Europe almost every year. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim
   Over the last two decades, thousands of northward migrating ruffs (Philomachus pugnax) have disappeared from western European staging sites. These migratory ruffs were partly temperate breeding birds, but most individuals head towards the Eurasian Arctic tundras where 95% of the global population breeds. This regional decline may represent either: (1) local loss of breeding birds in western Europe, (2) a global decline, (3) shift(s) in distribution or (4) a combination of these.
   Location
   Northern Eurasia.
   Methods
   To put the declines in western Europe in context, we analysed Arctic monitoring data from the last two decades (Soloviev & Tomkovich, 2009) to detect changes in regional breeding densities across northern Eurasia. We used a novel approach applying generalized additive modelling (GAM) and generalized estimations equations (GEE).
   Results
   We show that the global breeding population of ruffs has made a significant eastwards shift into the Asian part of the breeding range. In the European Arctic, ruffs decreased during the last 18 years. At the same time, in western Siberia, ruffs increased. In eastern Siberia, no significant population changes could be detected. These changes corroborate the finding that during northward migration, growing numbers of ruffs avoided staging areas in the Netherlands and Sweden and started migrating along a more easterly route leading into western Siberia.
   Main conclusions
   We detected an unprecedented large-scale population redistribution of ruffs and suggest that this is a response to loss of habitat quality at the traditional staging site in the Netherlands.

AB  - The last glacial period had a strong influence on the population genetic structure of boreal species in southern and central Europe. In addition, recent and current human impact on the boreal environment has led to habitat loss, which also has a large influence on population genetic structure of species. Here we present the spatial genetic structure of the boreal dragonfly Leucorrhinia dubia using ddRAD sequencing. We sampled individuals from nine locations in Europe, three in Asia (Russia and Japan) and one location of L. intermedia in Japan. Results showed three distinct genetic clusters in Europe. One genetic cluster consisted of individuals sampled from the locations in the Swiss Alps, a second consisted of individuals sampled in the United Kingdom, and a third cluster consisted of individuals from the rest of the seven sampled locations in Europe covering a latitudinal gradient from the French Pyrenees to the north of Finland. There was also a week support that the French Pyrenees and Austrian Alps samples differentiated from the cluster of the five samples from central and north Europe. We suggest that these clusters reflect historical recolonization patterns since the last glaciation. The L. dubia individuals sampled from locations in Asia formed one cluster referring to L. dubia orientalis separated from the individuals sampled in European and from the L. intermedia locality sampled. Our result suggests that aquatic insects in the fragmented boreal landscape in south central Europe and United Kingdom need conservation consideration.

AB  - Microbial communities are major players in the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning of river networks. Despite their importance in the ecosystem, biomonitoring tools relying on prokaryotes are still lacking. Only a few studies have employed both metabarcoding and quantitative techniques such as catalysed reported deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) to analyse prokaryotic communities of epilithic biofilms in river ecosystems. We intended to investigate the efficacy of both techniques in detecting changes in microbial community structure associated with environmental drivers. We report a significant correlation between the prokaryotic community composition and pH in rivers from two different geographical areas in Norway. Both CARD-FISH and metabarcoding data were following the pattern of the environmental variables, but the main feature distinguishing the community composition was the regional difference itself. Beta-dispersion analyses on both CARD-FISH abundance and metabarcoding data revealed higher accuracy of metabarcoding to differentiate regions and river systems. The CARD-FISH results showed high variability, even for samples within the same river, probably due to some unmeasured microscale ecological variability which we could not resolve. We also present a statistical method, which uses variation coefficient and overall prevalence of taxonomic groups, to detect possible biological indicators among prokaryotes using metabarcoding data. The development of new prokaryotic bioindicators would benefit from both techniques used in this study, but metabarcoding seems to be faster and more reliable than CARD-FISH for large scale bio-assessment.

AB  - In regulated rivers, canalization and reduced water discharge may lead to loss or impairment of salmonid spawning areas, and thereby negative effects on stock recruitment. We discuss the possibility of mitigating such effects through establishing new spawning areas by addition of gravel. We monitored the occurrence of nests in seven gravel deposition sites in five different Norwegian rivers. The total area covered by each of the depositions spanned from 25 m 2 to 300 m(2). The areas were examined for nests during a 2-5 year period following the addition of gravel, that is, a total of 27 spawning periods. The fish were found to spawn at all localities and years with the exception of two occasions when gravel was lost during floods. Spawning success measured as egg survival was generally high (>80%). These results show that the additions met the criteria for successful spawning. Nests of Atlantic salmon were found to be aggregated in the area with the highest water current. However, successful nests were also found in areas with added gravel where the water current was much reduced. This unusual selection of spawring site most likely reflects the lack of other, more favourable spawning areas. The results therefore suggest that gravel additions can be successful even if the only available areas are suboptimal with respect to water flow and water depth. Three of the seven localities were unsuitable as the gravel was partly or totally displaced downstream during floods. At two of these localities, nests were probably lost because the floods occurred after the spawning season. This shows that large floods can be a major drawback. Monitoring of the spawning success and displacement of gravel is therefore essential to evaluate the method. Subsequently, stable areas, favoured by the spawners, can be expanded by supplementary addition of gravel. In sum, the results show that the careful addition of gravel areas can be used to provide suitable spawning locations for salmonids in regulated rivers. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Modification of forest attributes and structural components like downed wood (DW) during forest harvest can lead to local species loss. Epixylic bryophytes have been proposed as good indicators of such changes. Unharvested control, variable canopy retention, and single pass harvest represent a gradient in forest harvest impact and can be used to test the response of epixylic bryophytes to different levels of environmental change. The objective of this study was to see if variable canopy retention attenuates environmental change associated with harvesting, consequently maintaining an epixylic community more similar to unharvested stands than single pass harvesting. Environmental conditions and DW characteristics were sampled on 225 DW pieces distributed in 45 permanent plots. Results showed that treatment affected epixylic richness through its impact on canopy openness and DW diameter and decomposition class. Fewer species were found in more open habitats and more species were found on bigger and more decomposed DW. Most epixylic species were more commonly found on the forest floor than on the DW. In conclusion, variable canopy retention harvest offered microclimatic conditions and DW availability and quality more suitable for epixylic species than single pass harvest, which was less suitable for epixylic species.

AB  - The moss biomonitoring technique was used in 2002, 2005, 2010 and 2015 in a potentially toxic elements study (PTEs) in Macedonia. For that purpose, more than 70 moss samples from two dominant species (Hypnum cupressiforme and Homalothecium lutescens) were collected during the summers of the mentioned years. Total digestion of the samples was done using a microwave digestion system, whilst mercury was analyzed by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS). The content of mercury ranged from 0.018 mg/kg to 0.26 mg/kg in 2002, from 0.010 mg/kg to 0.42 mg/kg in 2005, from 0.010 mg/kg to 0.60 mg/kg in 2010 and from 0.020 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg in 2015. Analysis of the median values shows the increase of the content in the period 2002-2010 and a slight reduction of the air pollution with Hg in the period 2010-2015. Mercury distribution maps show that sites with increased concentrations of mercury in moss are likely impacted by anthropogenic pollution. The results were compared to similar studies done during the same years in neighboring countries and in Norway-which is a pristine area and serves as a reference, and it was concluded that mercury air pollution in Macedonia is significant primarily in industrialized regions.

AB  - Aim To study the present-day olive stands and their ecology in the eastern part of the territory of the ancient city of Sagalassos, to study the variation of olive pollen production and dispersal near the olive stands, to establish a modern pollen reference model, and to compare Hellenistic-Roman pollen data from two wetlands with this modern reference model.
   Location Eastern part of the territory of the ancient city of Sagalassos, western Taurus mountain range in south-west Turkey.
   Methods The study is based on field survey, pollen analysis of surface samples, multivariate statistics of modern pollen data and the use of 'modern analogues' in comparison with Hellenistic-Roman pollen samples.
   Results A field survey revealed the presence of 35 olive stands in the study area. These are mainly small-scale stands. The olive pollen representation in the surface samples is highly variable. Two groups of modern 'olive' pollen spectra could be distinguished: (1) a group representing mainly olive stands from lush and moist mixed orchards; and (2) a group representing mainly olive stands from open small-scale olive stands in combination with annual crop agriculture. Although no 'perfect' modern analogue was found for the Hellenistic-Roman pollen data, the fossil pollen data show similarities with modern spectra from the second group, due to the presence of relatively high pollen values for secondary anthropogenic indicators.
   Main conclusion A well-organized and diverse, but time- and energy-consuming, agricultural system was maintained nearby the wetlands of Canakli soils, presumably to maximize the yields in both valleys.

AB  - The coastal marine environment in the 8-fjords area on the Swedish west coast has been subjected to various stakeholder co-management initiatives since 1999. Stakeholders and authorities have acted by supporting and implementing gradually stricter fishing restrictions following the collapse in the 1970s of several demersal fish stocks and their apparent lack of recovery. Moreover, concerns have been raised regarding a locally sharp depletion of eelgrass meadows, in addition to an apparent increase in the number of seals and cormorants. The present 8-fjords initiative applies a cross-sector approach to environmental management and thus also addresses various types of environmental pollution. This study has compared the environmental work around the 8-fjords to 15 principles regarding the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). The main strength that has been identified among the EAF principles is the continuous involvement of stakeholders. Among weaknesses in the EAF is the scarcity of suitable indicators that are necessary for appropriate monitoring, especially biomasses of functional groups as well as economic and social indicators. Many environmental problems in the fjords remain and it is possible that improved adherence to EAF principles will facilitate solving some problems and alleviating others. Moreover, the application of the EAF in practice in the 8-fjords can serve as a guiding example for co-managing other aquatic ecosystems towards ecological, economic, and social sustainability. The experiences from the 8-fjords initiative, including its extensive stakeholder involvement, may serve as a practical EAF example to be studied by researchers and managers globally.

AB  - Citizen Scientists together with an increasing access to technology provide large datasets that can be used to study e.g. ecology and biodiversity. Unknown and varying sampling effort isa major issue when making inference based on citizen science data. In this paper we propose a modeling approach for accounting for variation in sampling effort due to accessibility. The paper is based on an illustrative case study using citizen science data of moose occurrence in Hedmark, Norway. The aim is to make inference about the importance of two geographical properties known to influence moose occurrence; terrain ruggedness index and solar radiation. Explanatory analysis shows that moose occurrences are overrepresented close to roads, and we use distance to roads as a proxy for accessibility. We propose a model based on a Bayesian Log-Gaussian Cox Process specification for occurrence. The model accounts for accessibility through two functional forms. This approach can be seen as a thinning process where probability of thinning, i.e. not observing, increases with increasing distances. For the moose case study distance to roads are used. Computationally efficient full Bayesian inference is performed using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach for spatial modeling. The proposed model as well as the consequences of not accounting for varying sampling effort due to accessibility are studied through a simulation study based on the case study. Considerable biases are found in estimates for the effect of radi-ation on moose occurrence when accessibility is not considered in the model.

AB  - This study seeks to overcome the gap between institutions and technology in the literature of the commons. It emphasises the importance of inviting and testing different technologies as actors that are of importance for resolving social dilemmas. In this study, a test is carried out to see if a certain accounting technology mediates factors that facilitate the sustainable management of commons. The technology that is tested in this study regards 'notched sticks' that were used as accounting in self-governed farming villages during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, especially in upper Dalarna, Sweden, when organising 'new urban commons'. The findings are that the notched sticks did function as mediators, connected in a network that did affect several factors, or conditions, for sustainable management of commons. As such, the technology of sticks was an actor that served in mediating relations, decision-making and transparency. For example, as accounting technology the sticks did change situations with possible individual bounded rationality through the construction of social entities and methods for balancing rights and obligations. Considering how accounting technology can be integrated into institutions, this implies that awareness is needed when changing and implementing technological solutions.

AB  - The extremely low rates of females compared to men, enrolled at Computer Sciences (CS) and Information Systems Universities result not only in a massive loss of talent for companies and economies but also perpetuate gaps in gender inequality in the ICT field. To face this, Universities and Research Organizations are gradually taking initiatives to address such gender imbalance, trying to intervene and raise the awareness on a complex set of rooted cultural/societal gender stereotypes, including gender bias and linking ICT with masculinity that are permeating early school education, STEM teaching practices and parents' attitudes. This approach is based on several studies on the current students that highlight how female bachelor students in CS have lower levels of self-confidence compared to their male counterparts which can negatively impact on their plans to continue their studies. Towards this direction, the Horizon 2020 EQUAL-IST (Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions) project supports six Universities across Europe (Italy, Lithuania, Germany, Ukraine, Finland, Portugal) to design and implement actions towards gender equality, with a specific focus on the ICT/IST area. The Universities have settled up several concrete initiatives to attract female students towards ICT studies. Specifically, this paper presents the best practice implemented at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, (UniMORE) the Summer Camp namely Ragazze Digitali (Digital Girls). The summer camp offers to female students of third and fourth grade of the high schools a first-hand experience based on a learn-by-doing approach to coding applied to creative and innovative fields, as well as inspiring female role models from the academia and the industry. For its scope, nature (free for the girls to participate) and duration (four entire weeks), the Summer Camp Ragazze Digitali represents a unique experience not only in Italy but also in Europe and, at the best of our knowledge, in the world. The paper describes the Summer Camp experience, highlighting the impacts of this experience on the female students, with particular attention to changed attitudes and plans for their future studies and careers.

AB  - A new species of arbuscularmycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomeromycota) was isolated from the rhizosphere of isoetid vegetation, namely of Littorella uniflora and Isoetes lacustris, in the freshwater lake Avsjoen (Central Norway), and propagated on bait cultures on Zea mays and L. uniflora, respectively. The fungus is distinguished by chestnut brown to dark brown, triple- layered spores, (137-)165-226(-285) mu m in diameter, and 1-2 concolorous subtending hyphae that regularly form multiple septae within 100600 mu m from the spore base, each approximately 10-25 mu m apart, while the pore directly at the spore base is open. It can easily be differentiated from all other species in the Glomeraceae by the combination of spore size, spore color, and the characteristics of the subtending hyphae. Phylogenetic analyses of the partial SSU, ITS, and partial LSU nrDNA sequences placed the fungus in the genus Rhizoglomus, well separated from all other species in the genus. The fungus described here as Rhizoglomus melanum was hitherto only found in lake sediments which might suggest its specificity for aquatic environment. It is the first new AM fungus ever, isolated and propagated from submerged, aquatic vegetation.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are having profound impacts on species interactions, with further consequences for populations and communities. We investigated the influence that anthropogenic eutrophication has on the prevalence of the parasitic tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus in threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus populations. We caught stickleback from four areas along the coast of Finland, and within each area from one undisturbed and one eutrophied habitat. We found the prevalence of the parasite to be lower in the eutrophied habitats at the start of the breeding season, probably because of fewer piscivorous birds that transmit the parasite. However, while the prevalence of the parasite declined across the season in the undisturbed habitat, it did less so in eutrophied habitats. We discuss different processes that could be behind the differences, such as lower predation rate on infected fish, higher food availability and less dispersal in eutrophied habitats. We found no effect of eutrophication on the proportion of infected stickleback that entered reproductive condition. Together with earlier findings, this suggests that eutrophication increases the proportion of infected stickleback that reproduce. This could promote the evolution of less parasite resistant populations, with potential consequences for the viability of the interacting parties of the host-parasite system.

AB  - P>1. The European eel population has decreased drastically during recent decades, and new EU-legislation calls for measures to change this negative trend. This decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including habitat fragmentation by structural barriers that prevent eels moving between freshwater and the sea. The success of downstream migrating adult silver eels migrating past a hydroelectric plant (HEP) in Sweden was examined by radio-telemetry, and the results were considered in a historical context by analysing catch data from the river for 1957-2006.
   2. The choice of routes and passage success were quantified for three treatment groups and one control group of silver eels. The first treatment, the reservoir group (n = 50), was released into the reservoir upstream of the HEP, and these fish could proceed downstream by passing through the HEP (20 mm rack and turbines) or by entering the spill gates into the former channel, bypassing the HEP. The second treatment group (inside rack, n = 15) was released downstream of the 20-mm rack and had to pass through the turbines to continue migration to the sea. The third treatment group consisted of dead radio-tagged eels (n = 6) that were released into the turbines to study the extent of drifting by dead individuals. Finally, the control group (n = 50) was released downstream of the HEP to test for effects of confounding factors.
   3. Most live individuals displayed migratory behaviour and continued to proceed downstream after release. Only 8% of the fish released in the reservoir or downstream of the HEP (control) did not migrate. The probability of reaching the next HEP, 24 km further downstream, was high for the control group (96%) and the reservoir-released individuals that passed the HEP via the spill gates and the former channel (83%). Survival was low and size-dependent for the individuals that passed the turbines (40%) and even lower for the individuals that had to pass through the rack and the turbines (26%). The overall passage success for eels released in the reservoir was 30%, including both routes.
   4. Annual catch data from 1957 to 2006 showed that the number of eels in the River Atran has decreased. Despite this decrease, escapement biomass has remained unchanged, because of the fact that the mean size of eels has doubled. Passage data from 2007 show that changes in size and abundance have resulted in a reduction of relative escapement to the sea to values that are 21-24% of what they were in 1957-66. However, this low level of escapement could potentially be rectified if appropriate measures facilitating HEP passage are successfully implemented, since the potential escapement biomass in the river, owing to the large size of the eels, has changed little since the 1950s.

AB  - Sustainable waste management is becoming a common goal in most countries. The national legal framework largely determines the waste management practices, the socio-demographic characteristics, and the economic level of the country and, in the case of businesses, the type of business, the industry in which it operates, and the sector-specific regulations to which it is subject. This paper aims to examine the importance that firms worldwide place on waste management by analyzing the evolution over time of waste management practices used by firms and how this evolution has varied across countries and sectors. The X-STATIS technique is applied to conduct a multivariate analysis using data from seven-hundred and eighty firms from twenty-eight countries and eight sectors from 2016 to 2020 (3900 observations). The results show that waste management has become more important worldwide over time. In terms of waste management practices, the management of the impacts of generated waste occupies the first place in the ranking, performed by 97.5% of the sampled firms in 2020; this is followed by the methods of the disposal of non-hazardous waste (66%) while waste prevention policies occupy the last place in the ranking (30.6%). At the country level, the most committed countries are Taiwan (74.3%) and Finland (70.6%), followed by France, Spain, Russia, Italy, and the United States (60.0-66.9%); meanwhile, the least committed countries are the United Kingdom, Australia, and Ireland (35-36%). At the sector level, consumer goods (63.7%) and oil and gas (63.0%) lead the ranking while the least committed sectors are technology and telecommunications (50.0%) and real estate services (49.3%). The evolution of companies' commitment to waste management is gradual in all sectors, with oil and gas at the top, with a percentage variation of 21.4%, and consumer goods at the bottom, with 5.2%. In addition, our results suggest that the sector influences waste management practices more than the country of origin of the firms.

AB  - The negotiations between Norway and Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, on the maritime delimitation in the Barents Sea have been going on for more than 30 years. Despite a declared will on both sides to reach an agreement, the prospect of an early settlement seems slight. Formally the delimitation problem concerns the distribution of the important economic resources in the area, i.e. petroleum and fish. In practice, however, the strategic importance of the area and impact of the international context on the bilateral relationship have played an important role in the negotiations. As a result, the parties have clearly different preferences for a solution. Because there is no practical need for a solution and because the parties do not see the boundary dispute as a strain on the relations between the two countries, the prospect of an early settlement is dependent on a political will on both sides to put this long standing conflict to an end.

AB  - Objective Physical healthcare has dominated the patient safety field; research in rnental healthcare is not as extensive but findings from physical healthcare cannot be applied to mental healthcare because it delivers specialised care that faces unique challenges. Therefore, a clearer focus and recognition of patient safety in mental health as a distinct research area is still needed. The study aim is to identify future research priorities in the field of patient safety in rnental health.
   Design Semistructured interviews were conducted with the experts to ascertain their views on research priorities in patient safety in mental health. A three-round online Delphi study was used to ascertain consensus on 117 research priority statements.
   Setting and participants Academic and service user experts from the USA, UK, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore were included.
   Main outcome measures Agreement in research priorities on a five-point scale.
   Results Seventy-nine statements achieved consensus (>70%). Three out of the top six research priorities were patient driven; experts agreed that understanding the patient perspective on safety planning, on self-harm and on medication was important.
   Conclusions This is the first international Delphi study to identify research priorities in safety in the mental field as determined by expert academic and service user perspectives. A reasonable consensus was obtained from international perspectives on future research priorities in patient safety in mental health; however, the patient perspective on their mental healthcare is a priority. The research agenda for patient safety in mental health identified here should be informed by patient safety science more broadly and used to further establish this area as a priority in its own right. The safety of mental health patients must have parity with that of physical health patients to achieve this.

AB  - Purpose - IT governance has become the recognized norm system for chief information officers. The purpose of this paper is to understand how CIOs relate to these norms, by studying how they legitimate incompliance with the norms.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses an interpretive, qualitative, structured interview study with 18 CIOs in large Swedish organizations regarded as having excellent IT governance practice, using motive talk as analytical lens to identify the informants' relationship to norms.
   Findings - The study identifies norm-specific patterns for how CIOs legitimate incompliance with IT governance, finding that CIOs use a combination of excuse and justifications as strategies of legitimation. The study also finds that CIOs display a tendency of not contesting IT governance-related norms unless these are in conflict with neighboring professional jurisdictions. This is regarded as an identification of the "margins" of IT governance.
   Research limitations/implications - The study illustrates how the theory of motive talk is a viable road ahead for future studies of IT professionals. The generalizability of the identified patterns of legitimation is limited by the selection of large organizations with solely male CIOs, as well as the selection of solely organizations that have succeeded in establishing external legitimacy concerning IT governance and the organizations being Swedish.
   Practical implications CIOs aspiring to increase their legitimacy should avoid direct conflicts with neighboring professions. In addition to this, they should also aspire to be clear in a separation of motive talk and actual practice, since full norm compliance may be detrimental to their factual operations.
   Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the methodological approach of combining motive talk and speech acts to investigate CIO legitimation practices.

AB  - Offshore wind energy is increasingly becoming an important part of European and global low-emission power systems. The aims of this paper are to create a shared understanding on the major drivers of offshore wind development in Finland and to explore how these drivers, and opportunities for the entire industry, may develop over the twenty-first century, under different global futures. This research develops extended shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) narratives for the offshore wind industry by using a virtual participatory workshop with expert stakeholders. According to our results, the five key drivers shaping the prospects of offshore wind development are public acceptability of offshore energy, global and national demand for low-emission energy, technological development and relative competitiveness of offshore energy, availability of space and wind resources, and energy markets and transmission infrastructure. Nationally extended SSP narratives, building on these key drivers, describe a wide range of alternative future risks and opportunities for developing offshore energy. Under sustainable development (SSP1), offshore wind is likely to soon become a major source of energy in the area, if developed in a balanced manner alongside other uses of the marine space. Under fossil-fuelled development (SSP5), offshore wind grows slower and may experience rapid uptake only in the latter half of the century. Under the regional rivalry scenario (SSP3), the need for local energy sources drives the national energy policies and may create new opportunities for offshore wind. Under the inequality scenario (SSP4), local municipalities and the residents decide on locations of new wind turbines and the overall magnitude of future offshore wind.

TI  - Knowing and Not Knowing: Addressing Chinese Objects in the Art Museum
T2  - OXFORD ART JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - This article discusses a collection of Chinese art in KODE Art Museums in Bergen, Norway, donated during the first decades of the twentieth century by Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe (1864-1935), a Norwegian employee in the Chinese Customs Service. It performs a 'forensic' examination of this colonial collection by raising the following questions: What characterizes the objects' afterlife in the museum? Which narratives have framed it in the museum, both in terms of hagiographic texts and exhibitionary modes? And in what ways are these narratives undermined today, in a situation where matters of ownership and legitimacy increasingly reach the surface? Like many museums KODE seems hesitant or slow in the process of facing such challenges. Questioning the causes of this hesitation, the article argues that simultaneous 'knowing' and `not knowing' works as an evasive strategy, conscious or not. The multi-faceted lines of pressure, manifested as contrasted and conflicting epistemologies, value systems, codes of ethics, and ideologies, make the museum landscape difficult to navigate. The problem is not only about epistemology, or the lack of recognition and remembrance, but presents itself as a state of perplexity - bewilderment, doubt, and uncertainty.

AB  - In this paper, I argue that the implementation of the "Swedish model"-the criminalization of the purchase of sex-in Northern Ireland in 2014 provides an example of a morality-driven policy process in which the actual concerns of sex workers were distorted and dismissed. In the policy debate, sex workers were portrayed as victims who had no choice-a claim passionately refuted by many sex workers. As a result of the narrow focus on "victim vs. free choice," there has been little room to discuss the actual working conditions of sex workers and the structural constraints that inhibit their freedom and negatively affect their well-being. In this paper, I present the contradictions and conflicts between the personal opinions of Northern Irish policy-makers on one hand and the actual experiences and views of sex workers on the other. By juxtaposing these views, I facilitate a belated conversation between policy-makers and sex workers-a conversation which can inform policy debates in other jurisdictions.

KW  - civil war
AB  - The conflict between Hakon Hakonsson and Skule Bardsson has been a recurring theme in Norwegian medieval research. In this article, three issues will be looked at in more detail. The traditional view that Skule was outmaneuvered by the circle around Hakon will be refuted by referring to the development of the relationship between them through the 1230s and the agreements on the distribution of power that followed. Skule's desire to be king is often given as an underlying motive for his rebellion against Hakon. At the same time, many historians believe that it was the new distribution of landed estates from 1237 that was the main reason for Skule's revolt. This article will argue against both of these interpretations and give an alternative explanation. There has been a unanimous view among historians that Skule's revolt was doomed to fail. This article argues against this view by highlighting the political and military status immediately prior to the Varbelgers defeat in Oslo on 21 April 1240. What decided the war was the outcome and consequences of the battle in Oslo, one of the few decisive battles in Norway.

AB  - Many saproxylic species are threatened in Europe because of habitat decline. Hollow trees represent an important habitat for saproxylic species. Artificial habitats may need to be created to maintain or increase the amount of habitat due to natural habitat decline. This study investigated the extent to which saproxylic beetles use artificial habitats in wooden boxes. The boxes were placed at various distances (0-1800 m) from known biodiversity hotspots with hollow oaks and studied over 10 years. Boxes were mainly filled with oak saw dust, oak leaves, hay and lucerne flour. In total, 2170 specimens of 91 saproxylic beetle species were sampled in 43 boxes. The abundance of species associated with tree hollows, wood rot and animal nests increased from the fourth to the final year, but species richness declined for all groups. This study shows that wooden boxes can function as saproxylic species habitats. The artificial habitats developed into a more hollow-like environment during the decade long experiment with fewer but more abundant tree hollow specialists.

AB  - The ongoing wide-scale introduction of nonnative plants across the world may negatively influence native invertebrate fauna, due to a lack of coevolved traits related to the novel plants, e.g., unique phytochemicals or shifted phenology. Nonnative plants, specifically trees, are common in urban environments, areas that already pose novel habitats to plants and wildlife through a wide array of anthropogenic factors. For example, impervious surfaces contribute to increased ambient temperatures, the so-called urban heat island effect (UHI), which can affect local plant phenology. Yet, few studies have simultaneously studied the effects of urbanization and tree species origin on urban invertebrate communities. We measured the city-level UHI and phenology of nine native and seven nonnative tree species in five city-center parks in southern Sweden, as well as four common native species in a rural control forest. We quantified the abundance of invertebrates on a subset of native and nonnative tree species through shake sampling, sticky traps, and frass collection. In the urban environment, nonnative trees hosted significantly fewer invertebrates compared to native trees. Furthermore, the nonnative trees had a delayed phenology compared to native species, while the peak of caterpillars associated with the subset of trees surveyed for this measure was significantly earlier compared to that of the native species studied. The effect of tree species origin on urban invertebrate abundance was of a greater magnitude (effect size) than the effect of urbanization on invertebrate abundance in native tree hosts. Hence, the results indicate that the impact of nonnative vegetation may be a stronger driver of invertebrate declines in urban areas than other factors. As the effect of species origin on tree phenology was at a level comparable to the urban effect, increasing prevalence of nonnative vegetation can potentially obscure effects of urbanization on phenology in large-scale studies, as well as induce mismatches to invertebrate populations. Since parks harbor a large proportion of urban biodiversity, native trees play a crucial role in such habitats and should not be considered replaceable by nonnative species in terms of conservation value.

AB  - Physical condition is important for the ability to resist various parasites and diseases as well as in escaping predators thus contributing to reproductive success, over-winter survival and possible declines in wildlife populations. However, in-depth research on trends in body condition is rare because decades-long datasets are not available for a majority of species. We analysed the long-term dataset of offspring covering 34 years, male parents (40 years) and female parents (42 years) to find out whether the decline of Tengmalm's owl population in western Finland is attributable to either decreased adult and/or juvenile body condition in interaction with changing weather conditions and density estimates of main foods. We found that body condition of parent owl males and females declined throughout the 40-year study period whereas the body condition of owlets at the fledging stage very slightly increased. The body condition of parent owls increased with augmenting depth of snow cover in late winter (January to March), and that of offspring improved with increasing precipitation in late spring (May to June). We conclude that the decreasing trend of body condition of parent owl males and females is important factor probably inducing reduced adult survival and reduced reproduction success thus contributing to the long-term decline of the Tengmalm's owl study population. The very slightly increasing trend of body condition of offspring is obviously not able to compensate the overall decline of Tengmalm's owl population, because the number of offspring in turn simultaneously decreased considerably in the long-term. The ongoing climate change appeared to work in opposite ways in this case because declining depth of snow cover will make the situation worse but increased precipitation will improve. We suggest that the main reasons for long-term decline of body condition of parent owls are interactive or additive effects of reduced food resources and increased overall predation risk due to habitat degradation (loss and fragmentation of mature and old-growth forests due to clear-felling) subsequently leading to decline of Tengmalm's owl study population.

AB  - Eutrophication and reduced grazing have led to an expansion of the common reed (Phragmites australis) in ar-chipelago areas in the Baltic Sea, while at the same time the composition of submerged vegetation has changed. Although reed is important as nursery habitat for many fish species, extensive emergent vegetation may reduce biodiversity and abundance of predatory fish. Pike (Esox lucius) is a predatory fish whose larvae and young-of -the-year find both food and shelter in reed but use different micro-habitats during different life-stages. Here we investigate the influence of reed and submerged vegetation on abundance and body size of adult pike during the spawning season. We predicted that coastal bays with extensive but heterogeneous reed beds with higher cover of submerged vegetation would have more and larger pike than bays with smaller, homogenous reed belts or with less submerged vegetation. To test these predictions, we estimated abundance and size-structure of adult pike from catches in angling fishing among 22 bays in the Stockholm archipelago at the Swedish Baltic Sea coast. Our analyses show that catches of adult pike were positively associated with both extensive reed beds and cover of rooted submerged vegetation. However, pike size was not correlated with any vegetation variable, but instead increased with wave exposure and bay area. Our study suggests that reed beds and submerged vegetation are important for adult pike during the spawning season, and even the most extensive reed beds had no evident negative effect on pike populations. We could not see any clear relationship between emergent reed habitat and cover of submerged vegetation among the studied bays, and conclude that to maintain pike population during the spawning season it is important that coastal bays have sufficient amounts of both reed beds and rooted submerged vegetation.

AB  - High latitude freshwater systems are facing changes in catchment-mediated allochthonous input, as well as physical and chemical controls triggered by on-going climate change, which may alter their carbon processing and ecological characteristics. To explore changes in chironomid functional responses and carbon utilization in relation to long-term environmental change, we studied a sediment core covering ca. 2000 years from a tundra lake in northern Finland, which was analysed for sediment geochemistry, isotopic composition of chironomid remains and their functional assemblages. We aimed to relate changes in chironomid functional feeding assemblages and resource utilization, based on Bayesian stable isotope modelling, and determined that the long-term resource utilization was more controlled by sediment geochemistry (resource availability) and climatic variables, reflecting changes in habitat and lake ontogeny, rather than the functional feeding assemblage composition. Change horizons were observed for both sediment geochemistry and functional assemblage composition. However, different timing of these changes suggests different drivers affecting the dynamics of primary production and chironomid community functionality. We also compared the recent warming period to Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), observing divergent patterns, which suggests that MCA may not be a good analogue for changes induced by on-going climate warming.

CP  - European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2006)
AB  - The paper discusses the role of metaphors in the process of reframing and redefining risks. The objective is to discuss the usefulness of metaphors in handling risk issues among stakeholders with conflicting goals. The use of metaphors is traced back to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric. Normally, the use of metaphors and "metaphoric tricks" in science has been banned. The empirical basis is a trailing-research based evaluation project where the "Janus-metaphor" was introduced in the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD). The metaphor had a catalysing effect by revealing tacit opinions and controversies between different stakeholders, therefore playing an important role in redesigning the organisation and in redefining risks and hazards the organisation is obliged to deal with. Metaphors can be useful tools in the search for problem redefinition and reflections upon status and options. "Metaphoric tricks" can be powerful tools in the initial learning process. But the inbuilt ambiguity present in metaphors can create confusion, conflicts or superstitious unity in the implementation phases.

AB  - Several roadside soil samples were collected at two field sites in Sweden. They were analysed for total elemental content (using both ICP-MS and XRF) and stable lead isotopes. Extraction with deicing salt solution and sequential extraction were performed in order to elucidate the potential mobility due to the use of deicing agents. The total concentrations of elements, especially lead, have decreased and lead is presently almost at background concentrations (15 - 51 ppm for surface samples). However, the isotopic signature indicates that old gasoline lead still is left at the site constructed prior to 1975. The field site constructed in 1992 showed, however, no Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio below 1.14. Only minor amounts were leached using deicing salt solutions; for lead only 0.29%, on average, was extracted indicating that the mobile fraction already was released. Sequential extraction indicated that lead mainly was associated with reducible (34.4%) and oxidisable (35.4%) fractions. Exchangable and acid soluble fractions contained 20.3% while 10.0% was found in the residual fraction. The salt extraction released, however, very low concentrations indicating that most in fraction 1 is acid soluble (e.g. carbonates). Tungsten was also found at high concentrations indicating a possible impact from studded tires. For tungsten the following composition was obtained: residual (48.0%) > oxidisable (47.6%) > reducible (3.3%) > exchangeable/ acid soluble (1.1%). From the isotopic studies it was also suggested that the order for incorporating anthropogenic lead into soils is exchangeable/ carbonates > (hydr) oxides > organic matter > residual. The multivariate technique principal component analysis (PCA) seems promising for evaluating large sequential extraction datasets.

AB  - Despite the increasing relevance of mixed stands due to their potential benefits; little information is available with regard to the effect of mixtures on yield in forest systems. Hence, it is necessary to study inter-specific relationships, and the resulting yield in mixed stands, which may vary with stand development, site or stand density, etc. In Spain, the province of Navarra is considered one of the biodiversity reservoirs; however, mixed forests occupy only a small area, probably as a consequence of management plans, in which there is an excessive focus on the productivity aspect, favoring the presence of pure stands of the most marketable species.
   The aim of this paper is to study how growth efficiencies of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) are modified by the admixture of the other species and to determine whether stand density modifies interspecific relationships and to what extent.
   Two models were fitted from Spanish National Forest Inventory data, for P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica respectively, which relate the growth efficiency of the species, i.e. the volume increment of the species divided by the species proportion by area, with dominant height, quadratic mean diameter, stocking degree, and the species proportions by area of each species. Growth efficiency of pine increased with the admixture of beech, decreasing this positive effect when stocking degree increased. However, the positive effect of pine admixture on beech growth was greater at higher stocking degrees. Growth efficiency of beech was also dependent on stand dominant height, resulting in a net negative mixing effect when stand dominant heights and stocking degrees were simultaneously low.
   There is a relatively large range of species proportions and stocking degrees which results in transgressive overyielding: higher volume increments in mixed stands than that of the most productive pure pine stands. We concluded that stocking degree is a key factor in between-species interactions, being the effects of mixing not always greater at higher stand densities, but it depends on species composition.

AB  - What are the most viable global pathways for a major expansion of zero-carbon emissions electricity sources given the diversity of regional technical, socio-political and economic constraints? We modelled a range of zero-emissions energy scenarios across nations that were designed to meet projected final energy demand in 2060, and optimised to derive the best globally aggregated results in terms of minimising costs and land use (a surrogate for environmental impacts). We found that a delayed energy transition to a zero-emissions pathway will decrease investment costs (-$3,431 billion), but increase cumulative CO2 emissions (additional 696 Gt). A renewable-only scenario would convert >7.4% of the global land area to energy production, whereas a maximum nuclear scenario would affect <0.4% of land area, including mining, spent-fuel storage, and buffer zones. Moreover, a nuclear-free pathway would involve up to a 50% greater cumulative capital investment compared to a high nuclear penetration scenario ($73.7 trillion). However, for some nations with a high current share of renewables and a low projected future energy demand (e.g., Norway), pursuit of a higher nuclear share is suboptimal. In terms of the time frame for replacement of fossil fuels, achieving a global nuclear share of about 50% by 2060 would be a technically and economically plausible target if progressing at a pace of the average historical growth of nuclear power penetration in France from 1970 to 1986 (0.28 MWh person(-1) year(-1)). For effective climate-change mitigation, a high penetration of nuclear in association with a nationally appropriate mix of renewables achieves far superior cost and land effectiveness compared to a renewables-only future to reduce emissions.

AB  - Despite promises that they can contribute toward more environmentally beneficial transportation there are many sustainability concerns about liquid transport biofuels. In response to pressure from civil society, the European Union (EU) has introduced sustainability criteria for biofuels. A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply to be eligible for fiscal support such as tax exemptions. Flexibility in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 - a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains input output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustain ability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong 'sustainability performance' and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel 'sustainability'.

AB  - In this experimental isheries regulation study, we compared the effects of size-selective ishing according to minimum length limit (MLL, 40 cm) or harvestable slot-length limit (HSL, 40-64.9 cm) on population density, biomass, size and age structures, and sex ratio of the northern pike (Esox lucius). Data were collected during the years 2006-2013 in four 2.1-13.8 ha pristine forest lakes in southern Finland. In lakes where MLL ishing was carried out, pike density, biomass and size structure showed greater negative responses than in lakes where HSL ishing was carried out: mean length and age decreased, and large pike (>= 65 cm) disappeared in just four years. HSL ishing affected the pike to a lesser extent, and large pike remained in the lakes, which is considered an essential feature of sustainable ishing. However, the results suggest that the number of large pike may decrease even under the HSL ishing strategy if the growth rate is slow and ishing is intensive, due to the high possibility of ish being caught before reaching the length beyond the upper HSL limit.

AB  - A new, detailed geomorphological mapping system is tested at different scales for presentation of landscape configuration and interpretation of landscape development of a formerly glaciated area near Mora in central Sweden. The geomorphological maps are based on fieldwork supported by aerial photographs. The area contains landforms created by mass movement, glacial, glaciofluvial, fluvial, lacustrine, aeolian and anthropogenic processes. In addition, geomorphological effects of isostatic uplift, which has caused a c. 220 m rise of the former Ancylus lake shoreline in the area since the deglaciation, can be seen. The new system is tested at scales 1:5000, 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 using the same legend. At the largest scale information on morphography/morphometry, lithology, and hydrography are included in the map as are details on polygenetic origins of landforms. With each step from the 1:5000 to the 1:50,000 scale some generalisation is needed at the cost of descriptive detail. In turn, with smaller scale, the general overview of the area increases and the impression from the map gradually becomes more dominated by genesis. The emphasis of the map thus changes from a presentation with a high level of descriptive information at the largest scale to a more interpretative overview at smaller scales. The scale transformation shows that the geomorphological presentation of the landscape is a function of both the landscape hierarchy and the geomorphological context within an area. The use of the new geomorphological mapping system at the three scales shows that the tested mapping legend can be used without modification from one scale to another. This is mainly because the geomorphological information parameters are separated in the legend, and that explanatory information is gained from combinations of them. The possibility to apply the same legend at different scales for an area facilitates the choice of an appropriate mapping scale for specific purposes and applications. The new mapping system also has the advantage that the data can be easily transformed into a GIS ESRI geodatabase containing the same "raw-data" as the original map. The differences of information at the different scales illustrate problems that are also relevant for use and presentation of geomorphological data in a GIS and three examples of scale problems in relation to GIS data handling are outlined.

AB  - The unabated continuation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the lack of an international consensus on a stringent climate change mitigation policy underscore the importance of adaptation for coping with the all but inevitable changes in the climate system. Adaptation measures in forestry have particularly long lead times. A timely implementation is thus crucial for reducing the considerable climate vulnerability of forest ecosystems. However, since future environmental conditions as well as future societal demands on forests are inherently uncertain, a core requirement for adaptation is robustness to a wide variety of possible futures. Here we explicitly address the roles of climatic and social uncertainty in forest management, and tackle the question of robustness of adaptation measures in the context of multi-objective sustainable forest management (SFM). We used the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF) as a case study, and employed a comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework based on ecosystem modeling, multi-criteria decision analysis, and practitioner participation. We explicitly considered climate uncertainty by means of three climate change scenarios, and accounted for uncertainty in future social demands by means of three societal preference scenarios regarding SFM indicators. We found that the effects of climatic and social uncertainty on the projected performance of management were in the same order of magnitude, underlining the notion that climate change adaptation requires an integrated social-ecological perspective. Furthermore, our analysis of adaptation measures revealed considerable trade-offs between reducing adverse impacts of climate change and facilitating adaptive capacity. This finding implies that prioritization between these two general aims of adaptation is necessary in management planning, which we suggest can draw on uncertainty analysis: Where the variation induced by social-ecological uncertainty renders measures aiming to reduce climate change impacts statistically insignificant (i.e., for approximately one third of the investigated management units of the AFF case study), fostering adaptive capacity is suggested as the preferred pathway for adaptation. We conclude that climate change adaptation needs to balance between anticipating expected future conditions and building the capacity to address unknowns and surprises. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have measured pollen, aluminum, and lead abundances in a Czech peat bog at Bozi Dar in order to investigate the environmental impact of Holocene climate changes and mining activities in Central Europe. The pollen record shows a continuous vegetal cover since 13 kyr BP. Aluminum and pollen deposition characterize the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event at 12.3-11.0 kyr BP, within its expected time frame in Northern Europe. Aluminum fluxes reveal four other significant dust events with significant Asian and Saharan sources, as shown with variations in stable Pb-204, Pb-206, and Pb-207 isotopes. Recurrent Asian incursions are seen at Bozi Dar during the YD and Mid-Holocene dust events (at 7.1, 6.5, and 5.9 kyr BP). These Asian imprints are also observed by Le Roux and colleagues during the YD in the nearest Holocene-long geochemical peat record from Switzerland (Etang de la Gru re). We do not see at Bozi Dar the distinct western European volcanic inputs identified in the Swiss peat by Shotyk and colleagues. However, isotopic ratios characteristics of Mediterranean airflows are evident at both locations during the Mid-and Late Holocene. The occurrence of these various air mass sources in Switzerland and the Czech Republic substantiates Holocene atmospheric circulation models in Central Europe with dominating zonal airflows during the Early Holocene, followed by a governing meridian dispersion during the Mid-and Late Holocene. Lead inputs at 5.1-4.3 and 1.9 kyr BP cannot be explained by increased dust deposition only. The 1.9 kyr event fits local Bohemian ore isotopic imprints of which isotopic signatures are seen as early as 2.2 kyr BP in our core, hence revealing the oldest ever environmental record of mining-related activities in the Czech Republic. Relatively elevated Pb deposition at 5.1 and 4.3 kyr BP are tentatively attributed to contamination that may be from local sources and/or long-range transport.

AB  - In economic terms, resilience in farming has to do with the capacity of a farm business to survive various risks and other shocks. Despite its importance, resilience has seldom been directly considered in evaluations of economic sustainability. A whole-farm stochastic simulation model over a 6-year planning horizon was used to analyse organic and conventional cropping systems using a model of a representative farm in Eastern Norway. The relative economic sustainability of alternative systems under changing assumptions about future technology and price regimes was examined in terms of financial survival to the end of the planning period. The same alternatives were also compared in terms of stochastic efficiency. To model the risk of business failure adequately there is a need to deal with the risk of bankruptcy, and a modification of traditional analysis was used for that purpose. The organic farming system was found to be somewhat less economically sustainable than the conventional system, especially if the organic price premiums and the organic area payments were to be phased out. The results illustrate possible conflicts between pursuit of risk efficiency and economic sustainability. The model developed could be used to support farmers' choices between farming systems as well as to help policy makers develop more sharply targeted policies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the influence of built environment on running behavior is a significant step towards developing related landscape strategies. This paper adopted a volunteered geographic information (VGI) approach to measure urban runnability by quantifying environmental features that encourage or hinder running activities. The GPS-based routes collected from Strava were used to compute the running intensity of street segments in Helsinki, Finland. We applied multilevel regression models to assess the spatial-varied impacts of street environment on running intensity, so as to elicit runner's preferences and investigate their associations with socio-demographic characteristics at higher hierarchical level (neighbourhood). The results showed street greenery assessed by Green View Index (GVI) represented the greenness exposure to runners better than top-down greenness assessed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and thus can be considered as a more reliable predictor for running behaviours. Blue space density was the predominant factor and associated with running intensity positively. Running intensity negatively correlated with urban density, connectivity and traffic accidents, and positively correlated with traffic noise and air pollution. Population density and income level were positively associated with running intensity. These results provide profound insights and boost our capacity to design more attractive and sustainable streets for physical activity.

AB  - Purpose: Comparison of effective road safety approaches with those of relatively similar countries can be used to identify possibilities for safety improvement. Since there is no clear and comprehensive study of countries' current and successful approaches to road safety in the world, the aim of this study was to identifying common road safety approaches in the world.
   Methods: This study was performed using scoping review and thematic analysis. The study followed the approach proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. In this study all articles were selected without time limit by searching in the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and Embase. An initial search of 5612 papers was found and finally, 20 papers met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed.
   Results: There were different road safety approaches in different countries around the world, which were classified in three themes: traditional approach, systemic approach, and vision zero. The traditional approach includes the sub-theme of the road-user approach, and the causal approach. The systemic approach also includes sub-themes of sustainable safety, safety system, and the United Nations plan for decade of action.
   Conclusion: A systemic approach to road safety seems to be welcomed by most developed and developing countries, and a paradigm shift towards a safe system has taken place. Also, given the successful results of implementing vision zero in leading countries, most countries are trying to design and implement this approach. Finally, the choice and implementation of road safety approaches varies according to the principles, priorities and infrastructure of each country. (C) 2020 Chinese Medical Association.

AB  - The development and use of Driver Advisory Systems (DAS) is a topic of growing importance in research and industry today as railways face continuous pressure and challenge to reduce operating costs, improve energy efficiency, increase capacity and minimize environmental impact. DAS provide advice to driver aiming for optimized traffic flow and energy efficient driving. Based on real-time data communication between trains and train control center in combination with a centralized system for calculation of optimal train movements. CATO (Computer Aided Train Operation) offers a state-of-art connected DAS allowing trains to run as efficiently as possible considering the overall traffic situation on a railway line. In order to develop a successful DAS, the requirements for practical operation have to be carefully evaluated and clearly understood before implementation. CATO has been successfully deployed in Sweden and won the UIC Innovation Award for sustainable development.
   This paper will describe our experiences of important factors needed to achieve a successful DAS deployment, such as human-machine interaction issues, motivation factors, efficient communication and cooperation between train driver and dispatcher, good maintenance tools and continuous evaluation of the system performance.

AB  - Pollen, microscopic charcoal and peat humification analyses were applied to radiocarbon-dated peat cores to examine environmental change before and after the mid-Holocene transition from hunter-gatherer (Mesolithic) to agricultural (Neolithic) communities in presently marginal upland pasture at Stanshiel Rig, Annandale, southern Scotland. The Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in northern Britain is characterised by a number of key environmental changes as well as economic shifts, including anthropogenic vegetation disturbance, sharply fluctuating temporal patterns of fire and the Ulmus decline. Deliberate vegetation modification by Mesolithic communities is not demonstrable at Stanshiel Rig, and openings in the woodland canopy may have been promoted by grazing by wild animals or have been a consequence of climate change. Changes in fire frequency are also correlated with peat- and pollen-stratigraphic evidence for shifts to a drier climate in the late Mesolithic, probably mediated through pedological and biomass-storage change. A single Ulmus decline occurred between ca. 5650 and 5600 cal B.P., and is related here to climate change. Neolithic-age impacts on the woodland were limited, and no cereal-type pollen were found. The difference between hunter-gatherer and opportunistic farmer/hunter-gatherer at this locality is argued to be insignificant, or not detectable palynologically.

AB  - We hypothesise that differences in people's attitudes and personality traits lead them to attribute varying importance to environmental considerations, safety, comfort, convenience and flexibility. Differences in personality traits call be revealed not only in the individuals' choice of transport, but also in other actions of their everyday lives-such as how much they recycle, whether they take precautions or avoid dangerous pursuits. Conditioning on a set of exogenous individual characteristics, we use indicators of attitudes and personality traits to form latent variables for inclusion in an, otherwise standard, discrete mode choice model. With a sample of Swedish commuters, we find that both attitudes towards flexibility and comfort, as well as being pro-environmentally inclined, influence the individual's choice of mode. Although modal time and cost still are important, it follows that there are other ways, apart from economic incentives, to attract individuals to the, from society's perspective, desirable public modes of transport. Our results should provide useful information to policy-makers and transportation planners developing sustainable transportation systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Kamchatka Peninsula in the far east of Russia is a substantial landmass that is poorly documented in terms of most elements of biodiversity. Here we provide the first study of modern assemblages of testate amoebae, a widespread group of protists that are particularly abundant in soils. We present a data set of 78 widely distributed samples, including forest, fen, scrub and bog habitats. Testate amoebae are abundant and diverse across Kamchatka with 119 taxa identified. The assemblage is primarily composed of widespread taxa, but rarer occurrences such asCyclopyxis puteushint at important biogeographical differences that will require confirmation with molecular data. Assemblages from mineral soils are significantly different from those of peatlands with the former characterized by small idiosome taxa and the latter by larger taxa, often with secretion tests. Water table depth explained significant variance in the peatland samples, supporting the use of testate amoebae in palaeoecological studies. This study adds to our knowledge of the biodiversity of Kamchatka and the global biogeography of protists, and it paves the way for palaeoecological studies to understand long-term environmental change in this region.

AB  - In 1968, the British/Swedish architect Ralph Erskine published an article 'Architecture and town planning in the north' in this journal, in which he called for a particular Arctic approach to the design of buildings and cities that is distinct from mainstream architecture due to conditions such as harsh climate, resident indigenous or sparse population and remoteness. One hundred years after his birth (in 1914), Erskine is still considered the authoritative 'Arctic architect', and his approach is paradigmatic among many architects dealing with the built environment in the Arctic, sub-Arctic and northern regions.
   However, a study of the literature on architectural practice and the built environment in the north reveals a number of varying conceptions of Arctic architecture. These different perspectives are social in nature and construct the architectural technologies, the natural environment and society in different configurations. This article finds that architectural discourses and readings of the Arctic change under the influence of social, cultural, political and architectural paradigms. The perspectives identified in the article are seen to be critical supplements to Erskine's utopian approach to developing new sustainable forms of urbanism and architecture in the Arctic. They also reveal that new conceptions do not necessarily replace previous ones but often overlap and place earlier ideas into fresh concepts and that certain conceptions appear to perpetuate over the decades, such as the Arctic as an 'empty space'. The thinking on Arctic futures is, in many ways, trapped in certain modernist and utopian modes, and this article contributes to widening the range of possible relationships between people and the Arctic environment, using architecture as an aperture.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is a global environmental challenge, especially in densely populated regions. In urban areas, road traffic is an important source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, primarily due to exhaust gases. The adoption of paraffinic renewable diesel fuels for urban transportation has been suggested as a more sustainable and less air polluting alternative to conventional fossil fuels. The aim of this study is, therefore, to examine whether the transition from the conventional fossil fuel diesel to paraffinic renewable diesel (hydrotreated vegetable oil [HVO] according to the EN 15940 standard) can reduce PM2.5 and NOx emissions in an urban environment. The life cycle assessment-based handprint approach is utilized to calculate and demonstrate the emissions reduction. The reduction potential is quantified for Euro 4, 5 and 6 passenger diesel cars using actual car fleet, mileage, local temperature, and laboratory emissions measurements for 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. Our study shows that the use of HVO can reduce PM2.5 and NOx emissions in urban areas. According to our results, PM2.5 emissions could be reduced by 49% for the defined location and car fleet by replacing conventional fossil-fuel diesel with HVO. In the case of NOx emissions, the local reduction potential is 7%. Overall life cycle emissions reduction potentials of NOx and PM2.5 emissions are 11% and 44%, respectively, if conventional diesel is replaced by HVO. Thus, the manufacturer of HVO can communicate the air quality handprint, and in particular, the NOx and PM2.5 handprints, that their product can achieve. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A detailed analysis of indoor/outdoor physicochemical aerosol properties has been performed. Aerosol measurements were taken at two dwellings, one in the city center and the other in the suburbs of the Oslo metropolitan area, during summer/fall and winter/spring periods of 2002-2003. In this paper, emphasis is placed on the chemical characteristics (water-soluble ions and carbonaceous components) of fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles and their indoor/outdoor relationship. Results demonstrate that the carbonaceous species were dominant in all fractions of the PM10 particles (cut off. size: 0.09-11.31 mu m) during all measurement periods, except winter 2003, when increased concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions were predominant because of sea salt transport. The concentration of organic carbon was higher in the fine and coarse PM10 fractions indoors, whereas elemental carbon was higher indoors only in the coarse fraction. In regards to the carbonaceous species, local traffic and secondary organic aerosol formation were, probably, the main sources outdoors, whereas indoors combustion activities such as preparation of food, burning of candles, and cigarette smoking were the main sources. In contrast, the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions were higher outdoors than indoors. The variability of water-soluble inorganic ion concentrations outdoors was related to changes in emissions from local anthropogenic sources, long-range transport of particles, sea salt emissions, and resuspension of roadside and soil dusts. In the indoor environment the infiltration of the outdoor air indoors was the major source of inorganic ions.

AB  - While policy makers worldwide view maritime transport as a sustainable alternative to road freight transport, increased cargo volumes by sea inevitably boost activities in ports that are in the proximity of where people live. This paper proposes a production analysis framework for examining intertemporal changes in cargo volumes and in-port air pollution that decomposes the contributions of ship characteristics and port container handling productivity, efficiency, and technical changes to the overall changes. The framework is applied to analyze container handling in Norway from 2010 to 2015. The results indicate that increasing ship sizes lead to more pollution per hour spent berthing, but at the same time it often leads to higher container handling productivities and thus possibly to ships spending less time in port per container loaded/unloaded. While technical changes are found to reduce the duration of container handling by about 2-3 percent per quarter, port container handling productivity and efficiency changes appear to be the main drivers of environmental productivity growth.

AB  - The oilseed crop winter camelina (Camelina sativa) is attracting increasing interest for biofuel production. This study assessed the climate impacts of growing camelina as an intermediate crop in northern Europe (Sweden) for the production of vegetable oil and biofuel. Climate impacts were analyzed using life cycle assessment (LCA), while impacts on biodiversity and eutrophication were discussed. Three functional units were considered: 1 ha of land use, 1 kg of oil, and 1 MJ biofuel (hydrogenated vegetable oil, HVO). The results showed that dry matter yield over the whole crop rotation was higher in the camelina crop rotation, despite the lower yield of peas due to relay cropping with camelina. In the whole camelina crop rotation, fat production more than doubled, protein and fiber production marginally increased, and the production of carbohydrates decreased. Higher climate impacts related to field operations and fertilizer use in the camelina crop rotation, with associated N2O emissions, were compensated for by increased soil carbon accumulation due to the increased return of organic matter from the additional crop in the rotation. The total climate impact was around 0.5 kg CO2 eq/kg camelina oil when macronutrient allocation was used. The global warming potential was 15 g CO2 eq/MJ HVO, or 27 g CO2 eq/MJ HVO when soil organic carbon effects were not included, representing an 84% and 71% reduction, respectively, compared with fossil fuels.

AB  - The quantification of species along environmental gradients has long been the subject of study regarding natural plant communities and, more recently, ecosystems disturbed by anthropogenic emissions of eutrophying and acidifying substances. We studied 527 sites in southern Swedish deciduous forests divided into two regions, with mean nitrogen depositions of 17 and 9 kg ha(-1) y(-1). The higher deposition in the more exposed region has resulted in higher nitrogen mineralisation and nitrification rates. The objective was to identify nitrogen indicators, which we defined as species with a skewed distribution in relation to the net potential nitrogen mineralisation in the soil. Soil pH was introduced as a co-variable as it may relate to other factors limiting plant growth and survival in these ecosystems. We tested the distribution of the net potential mineralised ammonium (minNH(4)(+)), nitrate (minNO(3)(-)), total inorganic nitrogen (minNH(4)(+)+NO3-) and the ratio of nitrification (percentage of minNH(4)(+)+NO3- as nitrate; %minNO(3)(-)) in 77 herbs. The number of species that showed a skewed distribution differed for the nitrogen variables studied in the following order: %minNO(3)(-) > minNO(3)(-) > minNH(4)(+) much greater than minNH(4)(+)+NO3-. As many as 21 species in region 1 and 17 species in region 2 were selected as indicators for one or several of the nitrogen variables. A fern, five graminoids and seven forbs were found to be indicators of low %minNO(3)(-) and two ferns, two grasses and 13 forbs were found to be indicators of high %minNO(3)(-). We correlated the Ellenberg N indicator values with species with and without skewed distributions, and found that the former group was best related to the N values. As with most indicators, the species identified here are probably best used in combination with other measures to demonstrate the effects of nitrogen deposition on vegetation.

Data are collected from interviews with the shipper and its contracted freight forwarder, as well as from archival sources and visual observations, and applied to produce a framework.
   Findings - Logistics actions that can increase load factor are identified and categorised according to packaging efficiency, loading efficiency and booking efficiency, all of which are linked to logistics variables and specific performance measures in the framework. Visual observations of volumetric load factor in vehicles indicate room for improvement via, for example, making lead times more flexible.
   Originality/value - The framework clarifies the concept of load factor as a whole by explaining each logistics action's contribution to increasing load factor, as well as the actions' combined effect in the context of a shipper and its purchased transport share.

AB  - This article studies three key liquidities of a surfer-traveller lifestyle. The first liquidity is mobility, or the 'fluid' nature of the lifestyle, following Bauman's analysis of liquid modernity. The second liquidity is water: waves and sea. The third liquidity refers to oil, the 'lifeblood' of mobility. The analysis is based on 20 thematic life story interviews with Finnish surfer-travellers who lead a highly mobile lifestyle, one that often involves flying to distant surf locations. The results reveal that the three liquidities intertwine and blend in complex ways. Surfing deepens surfer-travellers' relationship with water, which enhances their understanding of ecological issues. Surfer-travellers largely desire to continue travelling, and their relationship with ecological issues is ambivalent, but they often also seek ways to compensate for their individual ecological footprint. Furthermore, many of them engage in various forms of environmental activism. The findings are connected with issues of sustainability in surfing and mobilities.

AB  - A new modeling approach which combined survival probabilities for spruce with financial optimization showed a considerably reduction in financial risk in spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) stands with an admixture of a 20% proportion of beech (Fagus sylvatica L). The admixture enhanced the stability of the spruce component against natural hazards, such as storm or insect damage. Here, these new survival investigations were integrated into a bio-economic modeling approach called silvicultural economics. A new failure model which includes the benefits of ecological interactions for decreasing hazard risk for spruce was developed. The modeling technique is based on Monte-Carlo-Simulation and on simultaneous portfolio optimization of management strategies under risk. Area proportions were allocated as decision variables to each tree species and to regeneration harvests at various points in time in order to achieve the maximum financial return given a predefined, acceptable risk. The simultaneous optimization led to a mixed - and, through long regeneration periods - to an uneven-aged forest stand, for almost all predefined risk-levels. In addition, for a selection of possible even-aged tree species compositions, a stand-level mixture (including the species interactions of the new model) was compared with the same species proportion at the stand level, but consisting of two separated parts of spruce and beech (thus excluding species interactions). For all even-aged and interacting mixtures that were investigated, a higher expected return and a lower financial risk were achieved when compared to the identical even-aged mixture proportions without interactions. When the timing and distribution of regeneration harvests was also optimized (as opposed to using a clear-cut strategy) there was a slight loss in financial return, but the reduction in risk was even greater, given the same tree species proportion - especially in cases with a low beech admixture. Compared to the simulation which excluded the stabilizing effect of beech on spruce, the variant with interacting tree species allowed for higher spruce proportions and shorter regeneration cycles for the same acceptable risk.

AB  - This introductory essay provides an overview, as well as a reassessment, of current theory, practice and ongoing research in human resource management 'with Chinese characteristics'. As the People's Republic of China (PRC) has become inexorably linked to the international economy and increasingly faces the challenges of globalization, its enterprises and people-management have had to adapt to this new, fast-changing environment. The contributions summarized and commented upon here attempt to explain how this has been achieved. They are all based on empirical on-site investigations by specialists in the field and deal with such HRM-related topics as: cross-national comparisons, devolution of HR practices, HRM regional modelling, human capital, globalization, organizational commitment, psychological capital, psychological contracts, supervisors and co-workers, work behaviour, work-family conflicts and the like. The contributors are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and university affiliations in Australia, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, PRC, UK and the US.

AB  - Kelp forests worldwide are known as hotspots for macroscopic biodiversity and primary production, yet very little is known about the biodiversity and roles of microorganisms in these ecosystems. Secondary production by heterotrophic bacteria associated to kelp is important in the food web as a link between kelp primary production and kelp forest consumers. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between bacterial diversity and two important processes in this ecosystem; bacterial secondary production and primary succession on kelp surfaces. To address this, kelp, Laminaria hyperborea, from southwestern Norway was sampled at different geographical locations and during an annual cycle. Pyrosequencing (454-sequencing) of amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria was used to study bacterial diversity. Incorporation of tritiated thymidine was used as a measure of bacterial production. Our data show that bacterial diversity (richness and evenness) increases with the age of the kelp surface, which corresponds to the primary succession of its bacterial communities. Higher evenness of bacterial operational taxonomical units (OTUs) is linked to higher bacterial production. Owing to the dominance of a few abundant OTUs, kelp surface biofilm communities may be characterized as low-diversity habitats. This is the first detailed study of kelp-associated bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing and it extends current knowledge on microbial community assembly and dynamics on living surfaces.

AB  - Impacts of tree diversity on forest soil fauna remain poorly known. Two groups of functionally similar in-vertebrates, millipedes (Diplopoda) and woodlice (Isopoda, Oniscidea), were sampled at 61 forest plots in four European countries (Finland, Poland, Romania, Italy) in order to (1) compare the abundance and species richness of these saprophagous macroarthropods in monospecific and mixed, three-species forest stands, and (2) deter-mine whether the influence of tree species richness depends or not on tree identity. The results showed that, boreal forests of Finland, regional conditions (temperature, soil) proved to be very unfavourable for millipedes and woodlice, which prevented further comparisons. In the other three regions, tree species richness had consistent effect on macroarthropod abundance but there was a clear trend towards a higher macroarthropod species richness in mixed stands compared to monospecific stands. This resulted mainly from a significantly positive response of millipedes to tree mixtures in hemiboreal forests of Poland and mountainous forests Romania, and from a slightly positive response of woodlice in thermophilous forests of Italy. However, not all tree mixtures were equally favourable for saprophagous macroarthropods. An examination of tree identity mixed stands showed that mixtures including hornbeam and conifers in Poland and those including beech and spruce in Romania had significantly higher macroarthropod species richness than the other mixed stands. Moreover, macroarthropod species richness was higher in these broadleaf-conifer mixtures than in monospecific stands of either component tree species, which supports the hypothesis of a greater diversity of resources for macroarthropods in these mixed stands. This hypothesis was not supported in Italy, where macroarthropod species richness was highest in monospecific chestnut stands. The positive influence of conifer presence on the species richness of saprophagous macroarthropods in Eastern European forests contrasts with results of previous studies, which calls for further research to explain those differences.

AB  - Mitigation of GHG emission is increasing concerned in the research field of road engineering. The quantitative assessments of integral road structural designs in different countries would shed light on the implementation of sustainable road development and global warming controlling. The study referred to the European E6 and the Yanqing-Chongli expressway to quantify the GHG emissions for Norwegian and Chinese roads, and investigate the critical procedures and factors in resulting in the differences of GHG emissions. The data inventory and research framework for life cycle assessment (LCA) were established according to their applied materials, structural design and construction techniques. Moreover, the quantification of GHG emission was conducted as considering the surface layers, base layers, subbase and frost protection layer. The comparative results indicate that the Norwegian road generated extra 1.43 t equivalent CO2 more than Chinese road during the 20-year service life, and the surface layers are the most source of GHG emission in road structure, which occupied 65.75% for Chinese road and 43.19% for Norwegian road. Additionally, the materials extraction phase caused the largest proportion of GHG emission in Chinese road case, while the road construction phase was verified as the capital GHG contributor in Norwegian road case with 108.27 t equivalent CO2 emitted. The obtained results in the comparative study could provide the practical references for low-carbon road construction and promising strategies for globalization development.

AB  - The Finnish coastal fishery of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the northern Baltic Sea is regulated using multi-annual, pre-fixed, opening dates of harvests that aim to enhance spawning escapement of early migrating wild salmon. Such an inflexible management regime does not set regulations that track varying run sizes of salmon. We introduce an array of computational intelligence techniques to estimate and forecast coastal run size and escapement of salmon into three spawning rivers in the northern Baltic Sea. Our results indicated that the present management pattern, driven largely by regional fisheries policy, contrasts greatly with a "run-size driven" (i.e. abundance-based) management approach. Introducing run-size driven management, i.e. setting regulations annually by tracking preseason forecasts, would better ensure adequate escapement and at the same time allow the maintenance of coastal catch at sustainable level. Setting regulations annually would allow effective harvesting in years when the run is high, and would effectively restrict harvests when the run is low. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although progressive government guidelines and awareness of sustainable issues exists, progress in sustainable management in the social housing sector has been slow. A market research survey and analysis of the sustainable housing management by Dutch housing associations indicates the areas and organizations where policies, instruments and practices are focussed or lacking. Longitudinal trends are established using further surveys from 1993, 1998 and 2000 as well as comparing national strategies from five European Union countries (the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France and Finland). Results indicate that efforts in sustainable management are misplaced with emphasis on procuring new buildings, not on operation and maintenance. Several barriers at the policy and strategy level are identified, especially the perceived costs of implementing environmental management, the lack of market demand and the poor capture of benefits. Special recommendations for government, housing associations and occupants are based on the findings-widening the focus of issues on sustainability, emphasizing the existing building stock, increasing the use of voluntary agreements, recognizing different capabilities in scale of housing associations and creating market demand.

AB  - The River Teno is the most visited river for recreational wild salmon fishing in Finland and is one of the most productive wild salmon rivers in Northern Europe. Despite the popularity of recreational fishing in the area, no estimates are available for its economic value. This study uses a travel cost recreation demand model to estimate the recreational value of salmon fishing in the Teno river area. Following a two-step estimation procedure outlined by McConnell, we show that on-site time per trip is endogenous. The estimated consumer surplus per trip ranges from 235 to 338 euros. The estimated total recreational value of salmon fishing in the area is 2.6-3.7 million euros. Also, according to the empirical results, the number of fishing trips per angler is strongly affected by the angler's previous salmon catch in the Teno river area, which underlines the importance of the proper and sustainable management of recreational salmon fisheries.

AB  - Seed bacterization with five plant growth promoting fluorescent Pseudomonas strains isolated from Indian and Swedish soils and three Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strains isolated from Swedish soils were shown to promote plant growth in Pisum sativum L. cv. Capella. Co-inoculation of the fluorescent pseudomonads and Rhizobium improved plant growth in terms of shoot height, root length and dry weight. Both the fluorescent pseudomonads and Rhizobium were shown to exhibit a wide range of antifungal activity against pathogens specific to pea. Seed bacterization with plant growth promoting strains alone and together with a rhizobial isolate, R 361-27 reduced the number of infected peas grown in Fusarium oxysporum infested soils. We found that the introduced organisms were able to colonize the roots, which was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining and drug resistant mutant strains. In a synthetic culture medium, all the plant growth promoting fluorescent pseudomonads strains produced siderophores, which shown to express antifungal and antibacterial activity. Our results suggest the potential use of these bacteria to induce plant growth and disease suppression in sustainable agriculture production systems.

AB  - This paper presents results from a study where identification and documentation of landscape changes using a combination of historical aerial photographs and newer airborne laser scanning (ALS) data were examined. The study was based on remotely sensed data covering a Norwegian protected cultural environment consisting of several pebble-stone built grave cairns. Georeferenced digital elevation models (DEMs) were generated using historical air photographs from the years 1968, 1979 and 1999. In addition ALS datasets from 2008 and 2010 were used in the study. Altogether seven difference models were generated as a result of conducting automated change detections between the different epochs. In this way detailed information about changes that occurred in the landscape and to individual monuments for almost the last 50 years was obtained. Further, the incidents that caused the identified changes were interpreted based on documents from archives. Using this approach the dynamic character of the studied protected site was proven. The study demonstrates the importance of historical aerial photographs as a valuable source that makes possible retrospective monitoring of past landscape changes on a detailed scale.

AB  - Soil rutting caused by forest operations has negative economic and ecological effects and thus limits for rutting are set by forest laws and sustainability criteria. Extensive data on rut depths are necessary for post-harvest quality control and development of models that link environmental conditions to rut formation. This study explored the use of a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor mounted on a forest harvester and forwarder to measure rut depths in real harvesting conditions in Southern Finland. LiDAR-derived rut depths were compared to manually measured rut depths. The results showed that at 10-20 m spatial resolution, the LiDAR method can provide unbiased estimates of rut depth with root mean square error (RMSE) < 3.5 cm compared to the manual rut depth measurements. The results suggest that a LiDAR sensor mounted on a forest vehicle can in future provide a viable method for the large-scale collection of rut depth data as part of normal forestry operations.

AB  - Climate change predictions indicate global changes in salinity with negative implications for plankton food webs; an important baseline for functioning of marine ecosystems. Current understanding of how salinity change will impact plankton communities is mostly limited to the salinization of freshwater environments, with little known about the effects of changing salinity in marine systems. In this study, we investigate the effect of salinity change on zooplankton communities under different salinity change scenarios of the Baltic Sea. Projections for future salinity change derived from regional physical-biogeochemical models were used to set-up an outdoor mesocosm experiment in the coastal area of the Gulf of Finland. Each mesocosm was inoculated with natural plankton using a mixture of both marine and freshwater communities, mimicking the natural influx of freshwater species from rivers into the Baltic Sea. Zooplankton diversity and composition changed possibly due to different salinity tolerances among the species. Among zooplankton, rotifers dominated in low salinities (74%) and cladocerans and copepods (69%) in high salinities. Our results suggest that the zooplankton community will shift to a rotifer dominated community in areas with declining salinity due to the intolerance of other zooplankton groups to freshening.

AB  - Triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) may play an important role in the sustainable expansion of the Norwegian aquaculture industry. Therefore, the susceptibility of triploid salmon to common infections such as salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causative agent of pancreas disease (PD), requires investigation. In this study, shortly after seawater transfer, diploid and triploid post-smolts were exposed to SAV type 3 (SAV3) using a bath challenge model where the infectious dose was 48 TCID50 ml(-1) of tank water. Copy number analysis of SAV3 RNA in heart tissue showed that there was no difference in viral loads between the diploids and triploids. Prevalence reached 100% by the end of the 35-day experimental period in both infected groups. However, prevalence accumulated more slowly in the triploid group reaching 19% and 56% at 14 and 21 days post exposure (dpe) respectively. Whereas prevalence in the diploid group was 82% and 100% at the same time points indicating some differences between diploid and triploid fish. Both heart and pancreas from infected groups at 14 dpe showed typical histopathological changes associated with pancreas disease. Observation of this slower accumulation of prevalence following a natural infection route was possible due to the early sampling points and the exposure to a relatively low dose of virus. The triploid salmon in this study were not more susceptible to SAV3 than diploid salmon indicating that they could be used commercially to reduce the environmental impact of escaped farmed fish interbreeding with wild salmon. This is important information regarding the future use of triploid fish in large scale aquaculture where SAV3 is a financial threat to increased production.

AB  - The article discusses modern consumption practices from the unity of economic, social and environmental aspects perspective. This unity is a condition for sustainable development, but in modern society economic indicators dominate and ecology is on the second place. Such circumstance is a consequence of the socio-economic system, known as a "consumer society". The article is focused on the identification of environmentally-based consumer behaviour models in modern society. The goal of the research is analysing the prosumerist model of consumption as an alternative to consumerism from an environmental position. The study is based on the concepts of sustainable development and consumer society, and also the idea of prosumerism as a new practice of production and consumption. The work used the method of involved observation, comparative analysis, and descriptive method. The scientific novelty of the results is the justification of prosumerism as an environmentally oriented model of consumer behaviour.
   The consumer society is characterized by mass production, increasing of free time, individual consumption, and a change in employment patterns in favour of the goods and services production. The growth of the individual wants and the expansion of production lead to consumption resources increasing. The consumer model cares about neither resource conservation nor future generations. The environment and natural wealth are considered as a manufacturing resource.
   In response to the negative effects of consumerism the concepts of conscious consumption, ethical and creative consumerism, highlighting the moral and aesthetic foundations of consumption are formed. The author thinks that in these conceptions the consumer has a passive role because he is not involved in the creation of the product. An alternative to uncontrolled consumption may become a prosumerism as a model of behaviour based on active consumer involvement in the production process. The prosumers' activity promotes resource conservation, the use of attainable materials, the creation products"on-demand". Since the producer is both a consumer and prosumer, the product a priori is important to the creator because of uniqueness and sense of personal involvement. As examples of successful prosumersist practices two projects wherein urban communities act as prosumers were sort. The first project concerns the citizens' involvement in solving urban problems and city management. The second one takes place in Norway and relates to attracting consumers to electricity production. The result of this project was the optimization of energy consumption. Both projects demonstrate social and environmental effects.
   The author comes to the conclusion: in order prosumerism will become a stable model of consumer behaviour, personal interest of consumers is necessary based on the possession or access to the means of production. In this case, prosumer activities can have not only economic results, but also social effects: public involvement in solving problems, including environmental ones, communities development, and increased civil responsibility.

AB  - Service accessibility and urban transportation choices are crucial in cities' endeavours for securing social equality and environmental sustainability. They are particularly relevant when the public service network is to be rationalized. In this paper we provide a practical example of comparing the impacts of current varying service allocation strategies on travel behaviour and the resulting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We take libraries as a local public service to examine the CO2 emissions resulting from residents' library trips in the capital region of Finland. Our analyses are based on data on library use (library loan database, N = 420,000), accessibility (comparable models of travel-time by car, public transportation and non-motorized transport) and customer transport choices (survey, n = 584). Our results show that (1) 52% of library customers use a library that is accessible from their home with minimum CO2 emissions (the "climate-optimal" facility provider), (2) the remaining 48% that choose a non-optimal facility provider produce nearly 90% of the total CO2-emissions related to library customer flows and (3) the service allocation strategies of the different municipalities lead to markedly different CO2-emission patterns resulting from service usage. To conclude, sustainability measures (in our case the CO2 burden) provide useful information on the impact of a service network structure which may be used alongside economic rationales.

AB  - Ukraine (UA) faces broad needs for energy security enhancement, energy diversification, revitalization of agriculture, and improvements in the state of the environment. UA has large biomass-for-bioenergy potential, which can be leveraged to contribute to local/regional energy self-sufficiency, rural development and diversification, and environmental improvement via fossil fuel substitution with local and more sustainable biofuels. However, the manner in which biomass energy utilization is emerging is poorly documented and its organizational basis is not well understood. This work focuses on bioenergy from agricultural waste as an early emergent area. It applies cross-case analysis to nine straw-fired installations in UA. Analysis yields three straw-based frameworks for organization and action, including small-scale local heat production, small-scale local straw production for municipal fuel provision, and medium-scale straw combustion for district heating (DH). The UA context is then compared to more advanced agro-bioenergy sectors in Sweden (SE) and Denmark (DK) to delineate crucial factors for the growth of UA's embryonic sector. The study finds that evolution of individual business entrepreneurship qualities and knowledge dissemination are key parameters to move the sector forward at small to medium scale, while stable and targeted incentive based systems, national government support, and collective bioenergy stakeholder action are required for advance to medium and large scales. Barriers to the expansion of bioenergy in UA include low access to technology and funding, and a lack of knowledge on bioenergy funding schemes, and bioenergy in general. The outcomes of the paper are principally transferable to other transition economies (EiTs). (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Artificial turf is widely used as a playing surface for many sports, including football. In Sweden the use of artificial turf allows people to play football in regions where the climate would otherwise prevent it, and is seen as a positive development from a football perspective. However, the widespread use of artificial turf pitches comes at a cost, with microplastic pollution a prime example. The integration of environmental sustainability in the management of artificial turf is dependent on a number of factors, including a complex policy terrain, which includes different kinds of policies over several policy levels. The purpose of this paper is to investigate barriers that prevent actors within artificial turf, who are generally positive towards sustainable practices, from acting in accordance with their intentions. Therefore, the value-action gap is chosen as a frame of refence to interpret semi-structured interviews with actors managing and using artificial turf. Sportification is also an important concept, since football, and organized sport in general, has a very important role in driving the proliferation of artificial turf pitches. The results compare the view of practitioners and users, describing a number of contextual obstacles to integrating environmental sustainability in artificial turf pitch management and usage. In addition, this study also identifies a number of technical and procedural improvements, and makes recommendations to provide practitioners with ways of improving their work with artificial turf pitches.

AB  - Tourism, and thereby hotels, play a crucial role in the European economy. The hotel sector features high energy consumption, which greatly contributes to the global warming effect. Thus, there is a need to investigate environmentally friendly technologies that have the potential to reduce energy usage within this sector. Information regarding the current status of the energy consumption in hotels is essential. Therefore, a study of 140 hotels in Norway and Sweden is presented in this paper to identify successful and sustainable measures to reduce energy consumption and related emissions. The energy use, available energy sources and thermal systems in the hotels are studied over a five-year period to identify consumption trends. The results reveal that 70% of the hotels have a mean annual energy consumption between 150 and 250 kWh/m2. A shift towards sustainable energy sources is observed in the hotels from 2015 to 2019, where application and overall consumption of district heating and cooling have increased, while electrical energy consumption has been reduced. District heating is the most prominent source of heating and is applied as the primary heat source in 70% of the hotels. The specific energy consumption for the group hotels that apply district heating is 218.9 kWh/m2/year, which is nearly 25% higher than the specific energy consumption of the 9% of hotels that apply heat pump solutions as a primary heat source. Thus, there is a potential to reduce the specific energy consumption in hotels. Two integrated transcritical carbon dioxide (CO2) heat pumps were investigated as a sustainable measure to reduce energy consumption. The results reveal that a reduction of thermal energy consumption of approximately 60% can be achieved. ? 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calculations of flows and balances of plant nutrients in agricultural production systems provide some basic information for the assessment of their long-term sustainability. The objectives of this study were to assess the possible impacts of variations in element concentrations between years and of undefined sinks and sources of elements on the accuracy of balance calculations. A 3-year study was conducted on Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, N, P, S, and Zn fluxes in the barns (subsystem) of a Swedish farm with separate conventional and organic milk production. Our main focus in this subproject was on barn balance calculations, the barn housing only cows. Barn balance for an element was defined as amount of that element in [feeds, heifers, bedding, water] - [milk, manure, urine, calves, culled cows]. The focus was on: (1) variations in element concentrations in the main flow carriers [feeds, milk, manure, urine]; (2) information about element dynamics and flows of dairy farming systems obtained from internal flows of elements in the barn balance compared with that obtained from the flows associated with milk production in a farm gate balance; (3) differences in element flows and concentrations between the organic and conventional farming systems on this farm.
   Our conclusions were: (1) the sampling methods used had low coefficients of variation and thus pooled samples can reduce the costs of element analyses. However, urine must be thoroughly mixed if less water-soluble elements are to be monitored. Magnesium differed significantly in concentrations between years in all feedstuffs; (2) year-to-year fluctuations in harvest can influence a calculation negatively if calculations are based on annual harvest and not on feed supplied. The barn balance calculation showed a source of Cu, Mn and Zn that would not have been obvious in a farm gate balance. The element content of manure and urine calculated as [inputs - milk] would have underestimated the amount of Cu, Mn and Zn in manure and overestimated the amount of K and N. The Cu analysis showed an example of conflicting goals between short-term welfare of the cows and long-term soil fertility. EU legislation regarding land for spreading of manure is not a guarantee against soil contamination by heavy metals; (3) the differences between the organic and conventional system related more to differences in forage: concentrate and home-grown: purchased ratios, which were typical for the average Swedish farm of each type, and less to differences in element concentrations of the feed ingredients.

AB  - Social media (web 2.0) is paramount in initiating economic potential and improving customer services and relations within the tourism industry; customers are now engaging in social media and businesses need to respond in order to contribute to a competitive European tourism industry. However, amongst some micro-business and Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) there has been a reluctance to engage in social media underpinned by a lack of targeted training in this area which responds to the specific needs of the industry and of the organisation. Given the growing recognition and importance of Web 2.0 technologies used by academics and the popular press, failure for SMEs to participate in these technologies could impoverish their digital experiences and thus result in lost opportunities for business development. Part of the problem lies in current mechanisms for engagement of businesses or practitioners in professional development. European commercial activity can no longer rely purely on formal education for the development of people engaged in work and should recognise that the knowledge that underpins practice is actually held within the community of its practitioners and brings meaning to learning. We have responded to this by creating a collaborative learning proposal which combines aspects of formal and informal learning to engage individuals at the grassroots level. The model, which uses a symbiotic approach to formal and informal learning is grassroots led, centred on the needs of the individual, but collaborative in nature and is based within an online learning environment. What this model provides is a means by which today's practical theories can be created by knowledge situated in the practice of those who have experience of it - daily practice reified through an informal collaborative network can become the basis for tomorrow's formal learning. Network technologies allow for this dynamic to be realised with an immediacy that is relevant, enabling the creation of focused, need driven learning. We have been successful in gaining Lifelong Learning Programme, Leonardo da Vinci Transfer of Innovation funding to pilot this innovative approach to technology enhanced learning within the workplace. Within the pilot we will be working with partners from Wales, Sweden and Bulgaria to test and develop this approach for web 2.0 training for the European tourism industry. A key component of the course development is the engagement of the industry themselves, and the ability for them to create their own training with facilitation by ourselves, located in the broader socio-cultural theory context and in particular the work of Wenger [1]. This paper reports on the learning model, its epistemological context and progress made in its implementation.

AB  - Efficient aquaculture is depending on sustainable protein sources. The shortage in marine raw materials has initiated a shift to "green aquafeeds" based on staple ingredients such as soy and wheat. Plant-based diets entail new challenges regarding fish health, product quality and consumer risks due to the possible presence of chemical contaminants, natural toxins and bioactive compounds like phytoestrogens. Daidzein (DAI), genistein (GEN) and glycitein (GLY) are major soy isoflavones with considerable estrogenic activities, potentially interfering with the piscine endocrine system and affecting consumers after carry-over. In this context, information on isoflavone biotransformation in fish is crucial for risk evaluation. We have therefore isolated hepatic fractions of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the most important species in Norwegian aquaculture, and used them to study isoflavone elimination and metabolite formation. The salmon liver microsomes and primary hepatocytes were characterized with respect to phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) and phase II uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) enzyme activities using specific probe substrates, which allowed comparison to results in other species. DAI, GEN and GLY were effectively cleared by UGT. Based on the measurement of exact masses, fragmentation patterns, and retention times in liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, we preliminarily identified the 7-O-glucuronides as the main metabolites in salmon, possibly produced by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9-like activities. In contrast, the production of oxidative metabolites by CYP was insignificant. Under optimized assay conditions, only small amounts of mono-hydroxylated DAI were detectable. These findings suggested that bioaccumulation of phytoestrogens in farmed salmon and consumer risks from soy-containing aquafeeds are unlikely.

AB  - The importance of lake ecosystems for waterfowl remains a topic of debate. In order to assess how temporal variations in lake features, specifically shifts between alternative stable states, may interact with the waterfowl fauna, we performed a long-term (22 years) study of the shallow Lake Krankesjon, southern Sweden. Lower total numbers of waterfowl occurred during periods with low macrophyte cover and turbid water, than when submersed macrophytes flourished and the water was clear. Some specific functional groups of waterfowl, such as herbivores, invertebrate, and fish feeders, showed a positive relation to clear water and high macrophyte cover. Hence, our data suggest that some migratory waterfowl may select lakes based on water quality, thereby adjusting their large-scale migratory routes. On the other hand, omnivorous waterfowl exhibited their highest abundances during turbid conditions. Furthermore, waterfowl not primarily relying on food from the lake showed no response to fluctuations in turbidity or macrophyte cover, but followed regional trends in population dynamics. In our study lake, L. Krankesjon, we estimated that waterfowl remove less than 3% of the macrophyte biomass during a stable clear-water state with lush macrophyte beds. However, during transition periods between alternative stable states, when macrophyte biomass is lower and the plants already stressed, the consumption rate of waterfowl may have a stronger effect on lake ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Over the last decades, levels of sulphur deposition from air pollution have been substantially reduced in Norway, whereas levels of nitrogen deposition have been stable or somewhat increased. In parallel, a clear trend of increasing annual temperatures, as well as precipitation, is evident. Human impact on natural ecosystems is predicted to reduce biodiversity at regional scales through facilitating a few generalist species at the expense of species with narrow habitat requirements. In this study, we investigate changes in community composition and the abundance of dominant lichen species on birch in subalpine forests over a 15-year period. The study is based on repeated measurements in five monitoring sites in Norway, representing regional gradients in temperature and precipitation as well as in deposition of nitrogen and sulphur compounds. Two dominant species are studied in particular; the generalist Hypogymnia physodes and the subalpine birch specialist Melanelia olivacea. The largest change in species composition was found in the site with the biggest reduction in sulphur deposition during the 15-year period, whereas the site with low precipitation and low pollution loads had small changes in species composition. The abundance of the generalist H. physodes increased in all sites and the specialist M. olivacea decreased in abundance, especially in sites with both high precipitation and heavy nitrogen deposition. Our study thus suggests that a warmer, humid climate is beneficial for the generalist H. physodes.

AB  - In this study, a decision support system to large-scale and long-term fuel procurement scheduling problems is considered for sustainable energy production. The problems include the allocation of a number of forest biomass procurement chains to an energy plant during different periods. In Finland district and roadside terminals are commonly used as forest fuel buffers of energy plants. However, due to the complex nature of the decentralized procurement problem, it is recently considered as an inefficient procurement chain. Therefore we tested the developed terminal planning system using plant terminal technology and forest fuel buffer decisions to better describe the combinatorial complexity of energy flows. We decoded the dynamic linear optimization program to the decision support system. This makes the approach usable by managers without requiring them to learn advanced programming skills. The total operating costs decreased 14.1% from 5.9 to 5.1 million Euros when the plant terminal technology was included. The properties of the decision support system are discussed and we present two examples of how the system works based on real-world data and plant terminal technology rate (500%) as an optional terminal buffer constraint.

AB  - Tundra soils account for 50% of global stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and it is expected that the amplified climate warming in high latitude could cause loss of this SOC through decomposition. Decomposed SOC could become hydrologically accessible, which increase downstream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and subsequent carbon release to the atmosphere, constituting a positive feedback to climate warming. However, DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate processes related to DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption, and leaching into a customized arctic version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS in order to mechanistically model catchment DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS is compared to observed DOC export at Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. Vegetation communities include flood-tolerant graminoids (Eriophorum) and Sphagnum moss, birch forest and dwarf shrub communities. The processes, sorption-desorption and microbial decomposition (DOC production and mineralization) are found to contribute most to the variance in DOC export based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) at grid cell-level. Catchment-level SA shows that the highest mean DOC exports come from the Eriophorum peatland (fen). A comparison with observations shows that the model captures the seasonality of DOC fluxes. Two catchment simulations, one without water lateral routing and one without peatland processes, were compared with the catchment simulations with all processes. The comparison showed that the current implementation of catchment lateral flow and peatland processes in LPJ-GUESS are essential to capture catchment-level DOC dynamics and indicate the model is at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The extended model provides a new tool to investigate potential interactions among climate change, vegetation dynamics, soil hydrology and DOC dynamics at both stand-alone to catchment scales.

AB  - Short rotation coppice willow (SRCW) is a high-yielding energy crop that can be used to produce solid, liquid or gaseous biofuels. The crop is harvested during the winter, when the leaves have dropped. For economic reasons, however, most fuel processing plants require continuous year-round delivery of raw material. Thus, SRCW should be harvested as stems or in larger pieces in order to be storable, and not chipped directly at harvest for immediate use in large-scale heating plants, which is common practice at present. The aim of the project within which this study was conducted is to find cost-effective whole-stem harvesting and handling systems for year-round deliveries of natural-dried SRCW. A discrete event simulation model for such systems was developed in this study, taking weather, soil trafficability, geographical conditions, natural drying of the material and storage losses into account. The model was applied to a fictitious processing plant in Uppsala, Sweden. Machine performance and costs for a system with one stem harvester and up to three infield shuttles, together with one chipper truck for chipping and transport, were investigated. The simulations showed that field trafficability had a crucial impact on total quantity harvested. The total cost was 40 t(-1) dry matter. Yield of SRCW and harvest productivity were important factors regarding costs. The model can be used to design cost-effective harvesting and handling systems for year-round deliveries of SRCW.

AB  - A policy is a course of action chosen by public authorities. A stakeholder in forest policy is someone interested in forestry. A group should either influence a case proportionally to the number of people in the group, or it should influence the case proportionally to its interest in the matter. The resources available to stakeholders may not reflect their legitimate claims. Some may be poorly organised, and have less influence than they deserve. In some cases, more vocal groups may sideline a silent majority. Formal representation of commercial interests is not sufficiently developed in many poor countries. In Zimbabwe, there has been little progress in allowing local communities to set their own rules, generate revenue from forest resources and democratically elect their own representatives. In Uganda, recent consultations on forest policy were undertaken with a variety of stakeholders never experienced before. This created great expectations among the stakeholders. In affluent societies stakeholder participation has a long tradition, but the rather narrow view of which interests should be involved in forest policy formulation has been challenged. Stakeholder participation is no guarantee that forest policy will be formulated with due consideration of the views of all participants. If the sector consists of stakeholder groups with conflicting interests, politicians must weight these interests against one another. Implementation reveals the actual priorities of government, and it is equally important that stakeholders have channels for expressing their views on implementation as it is for them to participate in policy formulation.

AB  - Parameters leading to the severe Flatanger and Frempty setya (Norway) January 2014 subzero wildfires, respectively burning 15 km(2) and 10 km(2) Atlantic heathlands (dominated by heather, Calluna vulgaris) and destroying 64 structures, have been analyzed. Traditional heathland management, including anthropogenic fire regimes, had not been performed in these areas over the last 50+ years. As a result, the vegetation composition consisted of degenerated old and woody Calluna stands, bushes and shrubs, with high amounts of accumulated (live and dead) biomass. Adiabatically heated subzero temperature easterlies dried the Calluna stands. When ignited, the lack of snow cover and the strong winds resulted in rapid fire spread. Rugged terrain, few hours of daylight at 64.4(omicron)N and the lack of roads and manmade fire lanes made controlling the fires very challenging. Drying experiments were conducted to learn how quickly Calluna plants dry at 20(omicron)C and 50% relative humidity from rain-wet conditions. Based on the surprisingly rapid drying of the lower (dead) canopy, vapor pressures and diffusion theory, it is concluded that the Flatanger and Frempty setya Calluna stands represented a severe fire risk within two days of exposure to 50% relative humidity air at 0(omicron)C. Young and more vigorous plants in the building phase (6-15 years old), as well as freeze drought damaged (typically some dead small branches) old but still live plants, showed different drying characteristics and dried more slowly. When understanding how degenerated Calluna stands, from Portugal to the Arctic Circle, dry in the wintertime, warnings may be issued when appropriate. This paper may also serve as input to discussions regarding the several-thousand-year tradition of prescribed burning versus potential raging wildfires in unmanaged Calluna stands.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is often framed as crucial for addressing the complex problems of contemporary society and for achieving new levels of innovation. But while science policy and institutions have provided a variety of incentives for stimulating interdisciplinary work throughout Europe, there is also growing evidence that some aspects of the academic system do not necessarily reward interdisciplinary work. In this study, we explore how mid-career researchers in an environmental science research center in Sweden relate to and handle the distinct forms of uncertainty that arise from conflicting institutional and policy impulses. Our material suggests that interdisciplinary academics are often confronted with and at times themselves operate with a surprisingly dichotomous, value-laden view of their research practice. Disciplinarity is primarily associated with the ideals of scientific rigor, while interdisciplinarity becomes conflated with application-oriented work and a lack of 'theory.' We also draw attention to the underlying practical dynamics that reproduce this tension and entangle it with the very process of academic socialization. Specifically, we analyze the ambivalent consequences of the various work-arounds that researchers rely on to carve out opportunities for ongoing interdisciplinary research within heterogeneous funding landscapes. These tactics turn out to be undermined by the overriding normative power of formal career incentives at universities, which continue to emphasize the ideals of the individual high-performing academic who publishes in disciplinary journals and attracts the most selective grants. Under such circumstances, the work-arounds themselves become an insidious mechanism that allows researchers to stay in academia but systematically marginalizes their voices and epistemic ambitions in the process.

AB  - Elevated phosphorus (P) use is a worldwide problem for the sustainability of agricultural production with consequences for both food production and water quality. The objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of P application and P balance on stream P concentrations in different production systems of Norwegian agriculture. The average application of P in the studied catchments ranged from 21 to 53 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), including the P application in both mineral fertiliser and manure for the monitoring periods (16-20 years). The highest P application was found in a catchment with high livestock density, and potato and vegetable production. This catchment also showed the highest P balance (applied P minus P removed with yields) of 26 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) on average, and also a very high soil P status (P-AL). The P balance for all other catchments ranged from 3 to 13 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). For all catchments, the average application of mineral P fertiliser decreased during the monitoring period, especially during the last 2-3 years. However, total P application increased in three catchments due to increased livestock density and manure P application. Average concentrations of total P in the streams varied from 65 to 392 mu g L-1. The highest concentration was measured in the stream from the catchment with highest P balance and soil P status. The concentrations of dissolved reactive P varied from 27 to 63 mu g L-1 with the highest concentration measured from an area with intensive livestock production. Reducing P application and soil P status to the minimum level for crop growth is important for the environmental quality of surface waters.

AB  - Public housing is often built in large quantities and in concentrated areas. The original focus on cost efficiency represents a challenge of creating sustainable buildings in contemporary society. Large portfolios ofbuildingsneed renovation appreciating future demands of energy consumption and economic, environmental and importantly social sustainability. New energy producing renewable technologies represent an important opportunity to meet these challenges. However, apart from the dominant agenda of large companiesin suburbs ofthe larger cities in Europe and Swedish towns, a series of small public housing companies exists which have parallel challenges, but receive far less attention from institutional players such as government authorities, researchers and policy makers.
   The aim of this contribution is to analyse challenges and opportunities of doingenergy plus renovation of small public housing companies in Sweden and to develop a possible roadmap for meeting the challenges. The theoretical framework draw on organisation, management in construction, political science and economics and energy renovation literature to conceptualise small organisations characteristics, and building processes of renovation. The empirical material has been done in collaboration with one company, literature study and interviews over a period of a year. The results show that the limited resources of small public housing companies can be tackled by providing extra manpower in the purchasing process and further in the renovation process. And by purchasing, organising and using a network for knowledge, including energy producing and energy saving technologies. If the rental is to be kept stable, it requires a new financial model for the public housing company. The roadmap developed in the project for doing energy plus renovation is presented, involving all phases of purchasing, design, building and operation. It involves systematic participation of tenants. It is structured in seven main phases to support the roadmaps role as a tool.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to suggest and discuss policy instruments that could lead towards a more sustainable waste management. The paper is based on evaluations from a large scale multi-disciplinary Swedish research program. The evaluations focus on environmental and economic impacts as well as social acceptance. The focus is on the Swedish waste management system but the results should be relevant also for other countries. Through the assessments and lessons learned during the research program we conclude that several policy instruments can be effective and possible to implement. Particularly, we put forward the following policy instruments: "Information"; "Compulsory recycling of recyclable materials"; "Weight-based waste fee in combination with information and developed recycling systems"; "Mandatory labeling of products containing hazardous chemicals", "Advertisements on request only and other waste minimization measures"; and "Differentiated VAT and subsidies for some services". Compulsory recycling of recyclable materials is the policy instrument that has the largest potential for decreasing the environmental impacts with the configurations studied here. The effects of the other policy instruments studied may be more limited and they typically need to be implemented in combination in order to have more significant impacts. Furthermore, policy makers need to take into account market and international aspects when implementing new instruments. In the more long term perspective, the above set of policy instruments may also need to be complemented with more transformational policy instruments that can significantly decrease the generation of waste.

AB  - A dynamic soil chemistry model, SAFE, was applied to boreal stands located in three regions of Quebec (Canada) to investigate the relative contributions of forest harvesting methods (whole-tree and stem-only harvesting), natural disturbances (wildfire and spruce budworm outbreak) and atmospheric deposition on base cation fluxes and the soil acid-base status. Model parameterization was done using measured and published soil and vegetation data, published trends of nutrient dynamics, governmental databases on atmospheric deposition and climate, the reconstruction method MAKEDEP and throughfall equations that we developed for coniferous stands. The model suggested that forest disturbances, both anthropogenic and natural, increased base saturation, and thus base cation availability, to different degrees for periods of one to five decades. However, such disturbances, no matter their interval of return and their intensity, did not appear to be the main driving force of soil chemistry in the long term. on the other hand, simulation results showed that the B horizon at all sites has undergone acidification due to acid atmospheric deposition during the 20th century. Results suggest that atmospheric deposition is the main driver of long-term trends of soil chemistry for the study sites and that the issue of sustainability of soil productivity depends more on air pollution abatement policies than on forest management strategies.

AB  - New innovations are called for to renew the European forest sector into bioeconomy. However, little research exists on how the industry innovativeness is publicly perceived. Using data collected with an online questionnaire in four European countries, we investigate perceptions related to forest sector innovations on 13 current and new bioeconomy-related products and services. Altogether, 218 valid responses were received in 2015, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics, performance-importance analysis, and Gartner's innovation hype cycle. Based on our results, the respondents were in the strongest agreement that the forest sector has since the year 2000 has produced innovations related to wood building systems, construction materials, and wood composites. In the next 15 years, they foresaw a decline in innovations related to biofuels and paper products. The European forest sector also has future potential in wood construction, which is likely related to international policy targets related to carbon mitigation and capture. The observed variation in perceptions among the respondents on forest sector innovativeness calls for strengthening industry R&D, as well as by improving societal awareness of ongoing innovation projects by developing better communication.

Rapid adaptation is expected if dispersers from lower latitudes have improved synchrony to northern conditions, thereby gain fitness and introduce genotypes on which selection acts. Here we provide experimental evidence that dispersal in an avian migrant enables rapid evolutionary adaptation. We translocated Dutch female pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and eggs to Sweden, where breeding phenology is similar to 15 days later. Translocated females bred earlier, and their fitness was 2.5 times higher than local Swedish flycatchers. We show that between-population variation in timing traits is highly heritable, and hence immigration of southern genotypes promotes the necessary evolutionary response. We conclude that studies on adaptation to large-scale environmental change should not just focus on plasticity and evolution based on standing genetic variation but should also include phenotype-habitat matching through dispersal as a viable route to adjust.

AB  - Using a representative sample of stands from a cross section through the Bavarian portion of the northern Calcareous Alps, this study evaluates the plausibility and significance of causal hypotheses for an explanation of the poor crown condition of Norway spruce in mountain forests: (1) ozone exposure in conjunction with (a) drought and (b) ample water supply; (2) soil-borne nutrient deficiency; (3) drought; and (4) tree age. Site index and, in a subset of stands, foliar nutrient concentrations are considered as additional indicators of tree vigour. According to principal component analysis and multiple regression, crown condition was controlled by soil chemistry (transparency increased towards shallow calcareous soils), stand age and, to a smaller degree, by an interaction between ozone exposure and drought. Site index was best explained by a model including elevation, soil chemistry and drought. Tree nutrition clearly reflected the main soil chemical gradient, and P, N and Fe deficiencies were found in transparent stands, which had markedly smaller needles. The similar distributions of crown transparency, site index and nutrition present a strong argument for the hypothesis that soil chemistry has constrained the vigour of spruce trees in the Calcareous Alps for a long time. By leaving unproductive stands to age naturally, forest management has accentuated the pattern of crown condition. In the heterogeneous alpine landscape, possible effects of recent increases in ozone exposure have to be viewed extremely carefully against the background of these natural and anthropogenic covariables.

AB  - 1. We studied the patterns of litter decomposition in lake littoral habitats and investigated whether decay rates, as an integrating proxy for environmental conditions in the sediment, would co-vary with net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane (CH4) efflux. These gas fluxes are known to be sensitive to environmental conditions. Losses in the mass of cellulose, root, rhizome and moss litter were measured during 2 years in boreal littoral wetlands in Finland and compared with published data on concurrently measured gas fluxes. Four study sites covered a range of sediment types and hydrological conditions.
   2. Decomposition was not linearly related to the duration of flooding but depended on sediment type. Readily decomposable litter fractions, such as cellulose and rhizome litter, lost mass at a faster rate in marshes with a longer period of flooding but wide water level fluctuations that hinder establishment of a Sphagnum cover, than in peat-forming fens. In marshes, the mean first-year mass losses were 83-99% and 19-62% for cellulose and rhizomes, respectively. In fens, the respective losses were 40-53% and 33%. In the first year, the loss in the mass of the more recalcitrant root litter did not differ between sites (mean 19-30%) and moss litter lost no mass.
   3. The estimated first-year carbon loss from belowground litter was about 0.1-0.3 times ecosystem respiration and roughly similar to net carbon gas (CO2, CH4) efflux, suggesting that vascular plants and recent plant residues contribute substantially to ecosystem release of carbon gases. On the other hand, at least 40% of the mass of the belowground litter remained on a littoral site after the first 2 years of decomposition. Slow decomposition may indicate the accumulation of organic-rich sediments. The accumulated carbon could explain the excess CO2 release found in most littoral sites. In continuously inundated sites decomposition rates were similar to those in periodically flooded sites, but ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange fell to close to zero. This discrepancy implies that the released CO2 is dissolved in water and may be exported into the pelagic zone of the lake.

AB  - The climate change forces us to shift from fossil to renewable resources. Integrated utilisation of biogenic CO2 is a promising way to produce sustainable raw materials and fuels. CO2 capture and utilisation (CCU) enables sustainable routes for carbon-based products and guiding the development to utilising especially biogenic instead of fossil CO2 directs the investments towards sustainable targets in the long term. Integrated CCU options benefit from a local CO2 source -substantially reducing the CO2 transportation costs, energy integration, customisable CO2 purity and the possibility to utilise the produced fuels and chemicals on-site. The key objective of this paper is to find out feasible utilisation pathways for biogenic CO2 in Finnish biomass driven industry sectors. As main results operational costs and incomes as well as profitability indicators are presented for each biogenic CO2 utilisation pathway.

AB  - This communication is drawn from the work of the European research project DayWater, which aims at the creation of an Adaptive Decision Support System for the integration of storm water source control into sustainable urban water management strategies. Source control techniques include all techniques (retention, infiltration, reuse) of treatment of stormwater near the source in contrast to end-of pipe techniques which aim at the concentration and treatment of water downstream. Thanks to this project we had the opportunity to collaborate with several stormwater 'managers' in Europe (participating countries: U.K, France, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece), specialists working in Water and Sewage Companies and in co-ordination institutions who have the obligation of assuring water management in river catchment areas or large metropolitan areas. In this communication we are going to present:
   The different stormwater management problems in Europe.
   The stormwater management problems in Greece
   Techniques of source control applied in European cities.
   How these techniques and policies could be applied in Greek Cities.
   In Greece in contrast to the other participating countries stormwater pollution is not perceived as a priority problem. Waste water management, promoted by European Directive (91/271/EU) and european funding, flood prevention and fresh water scarcity are priority problems. The question of treating the stormwater has not been yet evoked. Source control management of stormwater can contribute to all three problems.
   The new European Water Framework (2000/60/EC) demands the improvement of ecological status of water bodies and prescribes management of the pollution at its source. It also invites member countries in building an integrated water management policy (fresh water, waste water, storm water, bathing and other recreational activities, fisheries, industrial use etc.). Stormwater treatment is indispensable in order to reach these objectives. In most European cities source control techniques have been chosen for the treatment of stormwater because they are less expensive than massive end-of-pipe treatment installations, they are closer to the natural water cycle, they reduce the stormwater flow and they permit the expansion of cities without requesting new dimensioning and reconstruction of the existing sewer systems. Different policy instruments (taxes, special regulations and controls, information campaigns) have been applied in order to promote source control techniques.
   The main objective of this communication is to discuss the possibility of applying similar techniques and policies in Greek cities.

AB  - Farm-scale crop yield prediction is a natural development of sustainable agriculture, producing a rich amount of food without depleting and polluting environmental resources. Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m(2). In conclusion, the reusable farm-scale multi-temporal crop yield dataset and the proposed novel model could meet the actual requirements for the prediction targets in this paper, providing further valuable insights for the research community.

AB  - The use of disposable packaging is essential to the performance of global food systems, but it has led to global environmental problems. There is a recognised need for collaborative governance, because authoritative governance alone cannot push forward the systemic sustainability transformations required to resolve these challenges. In this qualitative case study, we apply interpretive policy analysis to study actors' motivations and experiences of deliberation. The aim is to understand how institutional ambiguities, caused by the intertwining of waste and food policies, shape collaboration around two different types of collaborative governance initiatives that address food packaging in Finland - the Plastics Roadmap and the Material Efficiency Commitment for the food industry. The results show that the deliberation is shaped by different sustainability narratives which have contradictory roles for food packaging. The contradiction arises from food and plastic policies which fail to properly address food packaging and its functions. By pointing to the importance of uncertainties in the governance of food packaging, our results emphasise the need to increase the understanding of institutional ambiguities related to policy topics that fall between the big policy debates. These ambiguities are nevertheless important and need to be addressed while attempting to achieve broader sustainability goals.

AB  - Emissions from vehicle diesel engines constitute a considerable share of anthropogenic emissions of pollutants, including many non-regulated compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes. One way to reduce these emissions might be to use fuels with low concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as Fischer Tropsch (F-T) diesels. Therefore this study compared Swedish Environmental Class 1 diesel (EC1) with the F-T diesel fuel Ecopar (TM) in terms of emissions under varied conditions (steady state, controlled transients and realistic work operations) in order to identify factors influencing emissions in actual operation.
   Using F-T diesel reduced emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons, but not alkenes. Emissions were equally dependent on work operation character (load, engine speed, occurrence of transients) for both fuels. There were indications that the emissions originated from unburnt fuel, rather than from combustion products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wastewater and waste sludge are generated in all parts of the world during domestic and industrial activities. Conventional wastewater treatment methods generate a highly concentrated municipal sludge, which needs to be disposed of effectively without leading to secondary pollution. Animal manure and post generated manure wastewater are another environmental concern. Both of the above wastewater and sludge/manure are rich in organic/inorganic forms of carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Anthropogenic and industrial activities in the global biogeochemical cycles have resulted in a drastic one-way mobilization of these resources into the atmosphere and the environment. The current intensive agriculture requires huge quantities of nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) containing fertilizers. The industrial production of ammonia and nitrates is quite energy demanding; however, nitrogen is abundantly present in the nature and therefore it is a non -restricted resource for nitrogen derivate production. Unlike nitrogen, P can be obtained primarily from mineral deposits available only in few geographic locations. The phosphate rock reserves are finite and the current intensive fertilizer production based on economically mined rocks could last only another 50-100 years. Since phosphates are available only in limited geographic locations and the recognition that geologic phosphates are a non-renewable resource, Phosphorus recovery becomes a crucial for sustainable food production as EU depends for 90% on import of phosphate rocks (European Commission 2017). Within the EU only Finland has some phosphate rocks. The list of supplying countries is quite short; more than 70% of the present known global reserves of phosphate rock are located in Morocco as of all mined and processed phosphate rock (2009). Phosphorus, being a finite resource with deficits starting approximately from the year 2070 due to increased demand might also result in high prices and reliance on single point sources, giving them monopoly over the market. The EU phosphorus flows show that the main losses of phosphorus in the food sector are through sewage sludge, other waste water and food waste. In general, phosphorus can be recycled, mainly from wastewater (e.g. sewage water), manure and organic waste (e.g. wasted food). Thus, wastewater can be considered as a renewable source of N and P. Instead of releasing the N and P rich wastewater into coastal and inland waters increasing eutrophication risk their utilization can be beneficial resulting in multiple benefits like nutrient recovery, water reclamation for reuse and maintenance of ecological balance in aquatic systems. Presently, the recovery and reuse of P is still far from being a main stream practice. Yet, the techniques already accepted and applied differ by the origin of the used matter (wastewater, sludge, ash) are mainly focused on the process of precipitation. One of these techniques is struvite precipitation, which can be implemented in wastewater treatment plants that use enhanced biological or semi biological/chemical phosphorus removal. Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate or MAP (MgNH4PO4-6H2O)) is formed by a basic precipitation reaction in different stages of the wastewater treatment process where magnesium (Mg2+), ammonium (NH4(+)) and orthophosphate (PO4-2).
   The article discusses the progress in extracting P from sewage sludge and animal manure, the conditions to create optimal conditions for struvite precipitation in such media and the way to overcome the problems associated with choosing the right Mg source, pH adjustment and the non-acceptable level of organic matter in the initial suspension.

AB  - Lead originating from coal burning, gasoline burning, and ore smelting was identified in Pb-210-dated profiles through eight peat bogs distributed over an area of 60 000 km(2). The Sphagnum-dominated bogs were located mainly in mountainous regions of the Czech Republic bordering with Germany, Austria, and Poland. Basal peat C-14-dated at 11 000 years BP had are relatively high Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio (1.193). Peat deposited around 1800 AD had a lower Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of 1.168-1.178, indicating that environmental lead in Central Europe had been largely affected by human activity (smelting) even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Five of the sites exhibited a nearly constant Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio (1.175) throughout the 19th century, resembling the "anthropogenic baseline" described in Northern Europe (1.17). At all sites, the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of peat decreased at least until 1980; at four sites, a reversal to more radiogenic values (higher Pb-206/Pb-207), typical of easing pollution, was observed in the following decade (1980-1990). A time series of annual outputs for 14 different mining districts dispersing lead into the environment has been constructed for the past 200 years. The production of Ag-Pb, coal, and leaded gasoline peaked in 1900, 1980, and 1980, respectively. In contrast to other European countries, no peak in annual Pb accumulation rates was found in 1900, the year of maximum ore smelting. The highest annual Pb accumulation rates in peat were consistent with the highest Pb emission rates from coal-fired power plants and traffic (1980). Although maximum coal and gasoline production coincided in time, their isotope ratios were unique. The mean measured Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios of local coal, ores, and gasoline were 1.19, 1.16, and 1.11, respectively. A considerable proportion of coal emissions, relative to gasoline emisions, was responsible for the higher Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in the recent atmosphere (1.15) compared to Western Europe (1.10). As in West European countries, the gasoline sold in the Czech Republic during the Communist era (1948-1989) contained an admixture of low-radiogenic Precambrian lead from Australia.

AB  - We studied variation in benthic macrocrustacean and insect assemblages in relation to spring habitat characteristics in six springs located in a single groundwater area in south-west Finland. We defined five habitat types in the studied springs according to water flow and benthic substrate characteristics: minerogenic brooks, organogenic brooks, helocrenes, floating moss carpets and limnocrene pools. Most studied invertebrate orders, as well as individual taxa, showed differences in relative abundances between the habitat types, but the most common taxa occurred in all springs and habitat types. The studied macroinvertebrates were most abundant in the moss carpet sites and least abundant in the pool sites, but the difference was not statistically significant. We did not observe significant differences in mean taxonomic richness per sample between habitat classes. The observed taxonomic richness in pooled samples of habitat classes was highest in moss carpet habitat and lowest in pool habitat, and the rarefied richness estimate was lowest in pool habitat. Benthic macrocrustacean and insect assemblages varied more between habitat types than between individual springs. In an Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination analysis, spring brook sites were separated from the moss carpet and pool sites, whereas helocrene sites were widely scattered among sites in other habitat classes. The strongest ecological gradients were related to water flow and the presence of minerogenic substrate, separating lentic and lotic habitats. Abundances of moss and coarse detritus accounted for most of the within-class variation. We identified several indicator species for minerogenic and organogenic brooks and for moss carpet and pool habitats, but none for the helocrenes. We found several occurrences of two crenobiont insect species considered threatened in Finland. We suggest that combined studies on macroinvertebrate and bryophyte assemblages would be a powerful approach in assessing the biodiversity of springs.

AB  - Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have been recognized to have potential in decarbonizing district heating, which is currently an urgent sustainability challenge in many European countries. In this paper, the financial impacts of replacing peat and biomass-powered Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants with heat-only reactors of 24-200 MW power range and maximum output temperatures of 120 degrees C are studied. A district heating system of a medium-sized Nordic city in Eastern Finland is modeled with EnergyPRO computer software (EMD International A/S, Aalborg, Denmark), which is used to optimize plant units' production for cost effectiveness. A future scenario is used to predict electricity prices, expenditures from CO(2)emission allowances, and fuel prices for the studied case. Results show that the low operating expenditures of CO(2)free heat-only reactors would compensate for the revenue losses from electricity sales and that a small number of micro reactors, with power output in the tens of megawatts range each, would be optimal for the studied case. Since investment cost estimates for SMRs still bear significant uncertainties, the subject should be followed in further studies, as heat-only SMRs could provide a profitable alternative for current CHP production in the future.

AB  - In this paper, we empirically and theoretically present regenerative regional development in responsible value chains as an alternative to the prevailing traditional, neoliberal economic rationale of globalization. We develop the argument on the back of a longitudinal in-depth case study on actors' engagement in the recurring crises in the maritime industry in Sunnmore/Norway. The alternative perspective is an agentic response from the business community in the wake of recent crises. It builds on advanced manufacturing capabilities, automation and precision technologies, which promise local economic regeneration while reducing the reliance on low-cost labour, substantially cuts emissions through reduced long-haul transport, use of green energy and more energy-efficient production processes. To succeed, however, it calls for policies that promote the building of local capabilities and penalize practices causing environmental and social harm in global value chains, making it possible to move towards responsible and shorter value chains.

AB  - From a management and research perspective, it is important to get a better understanding of what influences tourists in their decision to choose environmentally friendly travel options, and how these are related to social cognitive processes. This paper reports findings from two separate studies investigating the role of biases in social comparison, with particular reference to tourists' perception of their personal roles as environmentally friendly tourists, and especially tourists' views of the environmental attitudes of other tourists. Samples of N = 1607 and N = 2076 tourists, respectively, were obtained for two studies in Western Norway. Results indicate that tourists perceive themselves to hold more pro-environmental attitudes than other tourists (i.e. "typical tourist", "average tourist", "tourists"). This suggests that there are differences in the perception of the self and others when it comes to social comparisons concerning issues of environmental sustainability. The findings also suggest that tourists hold overly positive views of themselves generally concerning issues of environmental sustainability and that their environmental attitudes reflect perceived desirable standards. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed from a social psychological perspective, and implications for tourism managers and researchers noted.

AB  - The emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) has been applied in practice in few case studies on local/regional industrial recycling networks. Analogously to a natural ecosystem, the aim is to develop material cycles and energy cascades between local cooperative actors. An optimal resource basis of an industrial ecosystem is the Sustainable use of local renewable natural resources. In this paper, we consider the region of North Karelia in Finland, with 19 municipalities, and hence somewhat expand the system boundaries of an industrial ecosystem case study. The current situation and two scenarios of municipal heating energy production are presented. The heating system consists of individual, district and electric heating. The heat production and related greenhouse gas emissions are considered. The current fuel use is based on imported oil and regional fuels (peat, wood wastes). Also, shares for co-production of heat and electricity (CHP) are shown. In scenario one, we assume the majority of the fuel basis in oil and absence of CHP. Scenario two illustrates nearly complete dependence on regional wood wastes and firewood with the current share of CHP. The North Karelia region provides the IE theory with a fruitful case study because the supply of waste fuels and local renewables is vast and waste utilisation technologies (CHP, fluidized bed burning) constitute a significant part of energy production. Implications of the applied scenario approach are discussed in the context of regional decision making and, in particular, for its implementation with the concepts of a regional environmental management system (REMS) and a regional industrial ecosystem management system (RIEMS).

AB  - While populations of other migratory salmonids suffer in the Anthropocene, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbusca Salmonidae) are thriving, and their distribution is expanding both within their natural range and in the Atlantic and Arctic following introduction of the species to the White Sea in the 1950s. Pink salmon are now rapidly spreading in Europe and even across the ocean to North America. Large numbers of pink salmon breed in Norwegian rivers and small numbers of individuals have been captured throughout the North Atlantic since 2017. Although little is known about the biology and ecology of the pink salmon in its novel distribution, the impacts of the species' introduction are potentially highly significant for native species and watershed productivity. Contrasts between pink salmon in the native and extended ranges will be key to navigating management strategies for Atlantic nations where the pink salmon is entrenching itself among the fish fauna, posing potential threats to native fish communities. One key conclusion of this paper is that the species' heritable traits are rapidly selected and drive local adaptation and evolution. Within the Atlantic region, this may facilitate further establishment and spread. The invasion of pink salmon in the Atlantic basin is ultimately a massive ecological experiment and one of the first examples of a major faunal change in the North Atlantic Ocean that is already undergoing rapid changes due to other anthropogenic stressors. New research is urgently needed to understand the role and potential future impacts of pink salmon in Atlantic ecosystems.

AB  - All vascular plants, classified by life and growth form into six groups, four groups of hydrophytes (lemnids, nymphaeids, elodeids and isoetids), helophytes, and terrestrial species of pond margins, were inventoried in 64 SE Norwegian agricultural landscape ponds and their adjacent margins. The study sites varied considerably with respect to species richness; 0-4 for each hydrophyte group, 0-9 for helophytes, and 13-77 for terrestrial species. A total of 56 explanatory variables were recorded for each pond and adjacent margin to explain the observed richness variability.
   Species richness in each plant group was modelled separately by generalised linear models (GLM), using the recorded explanatory variables as predictors. Pond area, water depth and water chemical variables were the most important predictors of hydrophyte and helophyte species richness, followed by fluctuation and human impact variables such as liming and presence of ducks and fish. Pond margin area and geographical variables were significant predictors of richness of terrestrial species of pond margins.
   The contribution of different structuring processes to explanation of species richness patterns is discussed. The generally weak explanatory power of the selected variables indicates high importance of apparent randomness in this ecosystem, and, notably, that the ponds and their adjacent margins represent islands in the agricultural landscape that accumulate species more or less individualistically.

AB  - The cephalopods collected from the mud mounds of the Kullsberg Limestone Formation, late Sandbian-earliest Katian(?), south central Sweden, are highly diverse and comprise 26 identifiable species of 12 families and six orders in a sample of c. 180 specimens. The assemblage is strongly dominated by orthocerids in abundance and diversity. In contrast, the time-equivalent assemblage of the reef limestone of the Vasalemma Formation of Estonia is dominated by actinocerids and less diverse. Only one-third of the species co-occur in these two palaeogeographically relatively close assemblages. The taxonomic composition of the Kullsberg assemblage is, on the order level, more similar to that of the late Katian-early Hirnantian Boda Limestone Formation of south central Sweden, which represents a similar relatively deep depositional environment. The high local differentiation of cephalopod reef faunas exemplifies the importance of the emergent Baltic reef habitats in diversification processes during the early Late Ordovician. Of the described taxa, the following are new: Beloitoceras thorslundi sp. nov., Cameroceras motsognir sp. nov., Clothoceras thornquisti gen. et sp. nov., Danoceras skalbergensis sp. nov., Discoceras amtjaernense sp. nov., D. nilssoni sp. nov., Endoceras naekki sp. nov., Furudaloceras tomtei gen. et sp. nov., Isbergoceras consobrinum gen. et sp. nov., I. niger gen. et sp. nov., Isorthoceras nikwis sp. nov., I. sylphide sp. nov., I. urdr sp. nov., I. verdandi sp. nov., Kullsbergoceras nissei gen. et sp. nov., Ordogeisonoceras uppsalaensis sp. nov. and Valkyrioceras dalecarlia gen et sp. nov.

AB  - Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material, natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm densities (+76% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass (+13%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13%. The percentage of insect infested shoots was 8.8% of the total shoot population compared with 20.1% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment had stopped the reed stands showed an 'overshoot' biomass production, and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and benefits.

AB  - The renewable energy directive (RED) of the EU sets mandatory targets for increasing the use of renewable energy in EU member states by 2020. The RED introduces sustainability criteria for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids in order to ensure that their increasing production does not cause serious environmental and social problems. Bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis is one technology under development. The aim of this paper is to explore whether bio-oil derived from logging residues in Finland meets the GHG performance criteria set by the EU. The pyrolysis reactor is assumed to be integrated with a combined heat and power production plant (CHP). Special attention is paid to uncertainty analysis. An emission reduction target of 60% as compared to the reference fuel is exceeded if the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant are considered as separate units, and changes in soil carbon balances are ignored. On the contrary, the particular target is not met using a 20-year time frame for changes in soil carbon balances. The results depend in large measure on the selection of parameters set and the interpretation of the definitions provided in the RED to set the system boundary for the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant.

AB  - Although loss of genetic variation is frequently assumed to be associated with loss of adaptive potential, only few studies have examined adaptation in populations with little genetic variation. On the Swedish west coast, the northern fringe populations of the natterjack toad Bufo calamita inhabit an atypical habitat consisting of offshore rock islands. There are strong among-population differences in the amount of neutral genetic variation, making this system suitable for studies on mechanisms of trait divergence along a gradient of within-population genetic variation. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of population divergence using Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons and correlations between quantitative and neutral genetic variation. Our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the six populations included in this study, as indicated by low Q(ST)-F-ST values, lack of significant population x temperature interactions and lack of significant differences among the islands in breeding pond size. The six populations included in this study differed in both neutral and quantitative genetic variation. Also, the correlations between neutral and quantitative genetic variation tended to be positive, however, the relatively small number of populations prevents any strong conclusions based on these correlations. Contrary to the majority of Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons, our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the examined populations. Furthermore, the low heritability of fitness-related traits may limit evolutionary responses in some of the populations.

AB  - Microorganisms are essential constituents of ecosystems. To improve our understanding of how various factors shape microbial diversity and composition in nature it is important to study how microorganisms vary in space and time. Factors shaping microbial communities in ground level air have been surveyed in a limited number of studies, indicating that geographic location, season and local climate influence the microbial communities. However, few have surveyed more than one location, at high latitude or continuously over more than a year. We surveyed the airborne microbial communities over two full consecutive years in Kiruna, in the Arctic boreal zone, and Ljungbyhed, in the Southern nemoral zone of Sweden, by using a unique collection of archived air filters. We mapped both geographic and seasonal differences in bacterial and fungal communities and evaluated environmental factors that may contribute to these differences and found that location, season and weather influence the airborne communities. Location had stronger influence on the bacterial community composition compared to season, while location and season had equal influence on the fungal community composition. However, the airborne bacterial and fungal diversity showed overall the same trend over the seasons, regardless of location, with a peak during the warmer parts of the year, except for the fungal seasonal trend in Ljungbyhed, which fluctuated more within season. Interestingly, the diversity and evenness of the airborne communities were generally lower in Ljungbyhed. In addition, both bacterial and fungal communities varied significantly within and between locations, where orders like Rhizobiales, Rhodospirillales and Agaricales dominated in Kiruna, whereas Bacillales, Clostridiales and Sordariales dominated in Ljungbyhed. These differences are a likely reflection of the landscape surrounding the sampling sites where the landscape in Ljungbyhed is more homogenous and predominantly characterized by artificial and agricultural surroundings. Our results further indicate that local landscape, as well as seasonal variation, shapes microbial communities in air.

AB  - It is strongly implicated that cod in the North Atlantic Ocean is sub-structured at a small geographic scale exemplified by studies from Canadian, Icelandic, and Norwegian waters. In the first part of this review, we reviewed population genetics studies in these three areas and our conclusion is that, despite some inconsistencies in the numerous genetic studies of cod in Norwegian and Icelandic waters, and the northwest Atlantic, these studies illustrate that cod in the investigated areas consists of several distinct populations, both within and between areas. However, to understand the contradictory results obtained in some of the studies discussed in this review, more knowledge about the influence of natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift on the genetic material of cod is necessary. Such knowledge could guide us to the markers giving the best illustration of the genetic structure in these areas. Identifying and genetically characterizing wild stocks are essential steps for their conservation, since overexploitation of genetically different populations can lead to the loss of genetic variability and productivity in subsequent generations.
   Motivated by the hypothesis that growth patterns may reflect specific genotype adaptations, we reviewed stock specific responses on growth in the second part of this review and try to link these with the different life histories within the different stock units indicated in the first part of the review. An example of genetically-based differences between population units at two spawning localities off south Iceland is discussed. Studies have shown conflicting results, depending on which side of the Atlantic the problem has been investigated. We propose that a common-garden meta-analysis with several cod stocks from both sides of the Atlantic is needed to give any reasonable answer to the question of genetically-based growth differences.
   In this review, we have not tried to quantify how large the environmental part of growth regulation is versus the genetic part, as this information is not available in the published literature on cod. Based on recent research on two flatfish species (turbot and Atlantic halibut), approximately 30% of growth variation is caused by genetic factors, but it remains to be seen if this is similar in cod.

AB  - A study was undertaken to test the effects of molybdenum (Mo) and phosphorus (P) amendments on biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF) by boreal forest moss-associated cyanobacteria. Feather moss (Pleurozium schreben`) samples were collected on five sites, on two dates and at different roadside distances (0-100 m) corresponding to an assumed gradient of reactive N deposition. Potential BNF of Mo and P amended moss samples was measured using the acetylene reduction assay. Total N, P and heavy metal concentrations of mosses collected at 0 and 100 in from roadsides were also measured. Likewise, the needles from Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) at different roadside distances were collected in late summer and analyzed for total N, P and heavy metals. There was a significant increase in BM' with roadside distance on 7-of-10 individual Site x Date combinations. We found no clear evidence of an N gradient across roadside distances. Elemental analyses of feather moss and Norway spruce needle tissues suggested decreasing deposition of heavy metals (Mo-Co-Cr-Ni-V-Pb-Ag-Cu) as well as P with increasing distance from the roadside. The effects of Mo and P amendments on BM' were infrequent and inconsistent across roadside distances and across sites. One particular site, however, displayed greater concentrations of heavy metals near the roadside, as well as a steeper P fertility gradient with roadside distance, than the other sites. Here, BM' increased with roadside distance only when moss samples were amended with P. Also at this site, BM' across all roadside distances was higher when mosses were amended with both Mo and P, suggesting a co-limitation of these two nutrients in controlling BNF. In summary, our study showed a potential for car emissions to increase heavy metals and P along roadsides and underscored the putative roles of these anthropogenic pollutants on BNF in northern latitudes.

AB  - Co-management is of increasing interest for fisheries management. We explore possibilities for, and barriers to, developing a co-management system, using threatened populations of landlocked Atlantic Salmon and Brown Trout as examples. Good management of natural resources requires not only knowledge about the resource, but also suitable tools to collect information and make decisions. In large ecosystems this can be difficult because many actors are involved, and various societal borders and traditions become barriers. Vanern is the largest lake in the European Union and it holds several distinct populations of large-bodied landlocked Atlantic Salmon and Brown Trout. The lake is used for commercial, subsistence, and sport fishing as well as for other recreational activities; in Klaralven, the largest river entering Vanern, sport fishing is popular. These salmonid populations were at critically low levels during the 1960s, but a stocking program since then has maintained the fishery. At least one wild stock appears to be recovering since being protected in 1993. Ecosystem users all have different needs: in the lake, sport fishermen say that catches of hatchery fish have declined, and commercial fishermen have focused on other species. In the river, wild salmon may be recovering: sport fishing is popular and an ongoing project investigates the possibilities for salmon to be able to circumvent hydro-electrical plants and reach historical Norwegian spawning areas. Not only do we lack information about the salmonids' different life stages, we also lack a suitable socio-political organization to find sustainable solutions to the different needs of diverse user groups. We argue that a co-management system that enfranchises user groups in the Vanern-Klaralven ecosystem will improve sustainable management of wild and hatchery fish.

AB  - Automated robotic platforms are an important part of precision agriculture solutions for sustainable food production. Agri-robots require robust and accurate guidance systems in order to navigate between crops and to and from their base station. Onboard sensors such as machine vision cameras offer a flexible guidance alternative to more expensive solutions for structured environments such as scanning lidar or RTK-GNSS. The main challenges for visual crop row guidance are the dramatic differences in appearance of crops between farms and throughout the season and the variations in crop spacing and contours of the crop rows. Here we present a visual guidance pipeline for an agri-robot operating in strawberry fields in Norway that is based on semantic segmentation with a convolution neural network (CNN) to segment input RGB images into crop and not-crop (i.e., drivable terrain) regions. To handle the uneven contours of crop rows in Norway's hilly agricultural regions, we develop a new adaptive multi-ROI method for fitting trajectories to the drivable regions. We test our approach in open-loop trials with a real agri-robot operating in the field and show that our approach compares favourably to other traditional guidance approaches.

AB  - The behaviour of arsenic (As) derived from tailings was investigated at the Yara Siilinjarvi apatite mine and industrial site in eastern Finland. The study assessed factors influencing the migration and fate of As and compared the anthropogenic As load to the natural geogenic background. Environmental risks related to As were assessed by examining the As concentrations in humus, glacial till, aquatic sediments, groundwater, and surface water. The occurrence and fractionation of As and the presence of secondary precipitates and geochemical transformations in the tailings and in the ambient soil and sediment were evaluated by selective extraction. The water-derived emissions were evaluated by field measurements, hydrogeochemical analysis, and modelling. Results indicate elevated environmental risks due to dust and seepage emissions from the tailings since the concentrations and mobility of As and other potentially harmful elements (PHEs) such as Co, Ni, and Zn were elevated relative to the geogenic background. These elements were mainly associated with Fe (oxy)hydroxides in the soil and their mobility was closely linked to Fe biogeochemistry. Additionally, although the concentrations of As and PHEs were high in the tailings pond and seepage water, they decreased in ambient groundwater and surface water, indicating Fe (oxy)hydroxide stability. This was supported by hydrogeochemical modelling, which indicated precipitation of Fe oxides and hydroxides. According to speciation modelling, As was present mainly as toxic trivalent arsenious acid (H3AsO3) in groundwater and as the less toxic pentavalent As acid (H2AsO4 (-) and HAsO4 (2-)) in surface water.

AB  - P>1. The effects of harvest on the annual and seasonal survival of willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus L. were tested in a large-scale harvest experiment. Management units were randomly assigned to one of three experimental treatments: 0%, 15% or 30% harvest. Seasonal quotas were based on the experimental treatment and estimates of bird density before the hunting season. Survival rates and hazard functions for radio-marked ptarmigan were then estimated under the competing risks of harvest and natural mortality.
   2. The partially compensatory mortality hypothesis was supported: annual survival of ptarmigan was 0 center dot 54 +/- 0 center dot 08 SE under 0% harvest, 0 center dot 47 +/- 0 center dot 06 under 15% harvest, and was reduced to 0 center dot 30 +/- 0 center dot 05 under 30% harvest. Harvest mortality increased linearly from 0 center dot 08 +/- 0 center dot 05, 0 center dot 27 +/- 0 center dot 05 and 0 center dot 42 +/- 0 center dot 06 from 0% to 30% harvest, whereas natural mortality was 0 center dot 38 +/- 0 center dot 08, 0 center dot 25 +/- 0 center dot 05 and 0 center dot 28 +/- 0 center dot 06 under the same treatments.
   3. Realized risk of harvest mortality was 0 center dot 08-0 center dot 12 points higher than our set harvest treatments of 0-30% because birds were exposed to risk if they moved out of protected areas. The superadditive hypothesis was supported because birds in the 30% harvest treatment had higher natural mortality during winter after the hunting season.
   4. Natural mortality was mainly because of raptor predation, with two seasonal peaks in fall and spring. Natural and harvest mortality coincided during early autumn with little potential for compensation during winter months. Peak risk of harvest mortality was 5x higher than natural mortality. Low natural mortality during winter suggests that most late season harvest would be additive mortality.
   5. Environmental correlates of natural mortality of ptarmigan included seasonal changes in snow cover, onset of juvenile dispersal, and periods of territorial activity. Natural mortality of ptarmigan was highest during autumn movements and nesting by gyrfalcons Falco rusticolus L. Mortality was low when gyrfalcons had departed for coastal wintering sites, and during summer when ptarmigan were attending nests and broods.
   6. Our experimental results have important implications for harvest management of upland gamebirds. Seasonal quotas based on proportional harvest were effective and should be set at < 15% of August populations for regional management plans. Under threshold harvest of a reproductive surplus, 15% harvest would be sustainable at productivity rates >= 2 center dot 5 young per pair. Impacts of winter harvest could be minimized by closing the hunting season in early November or by reducing late season quotas.

AB  - Background: The safety of pedestrians is one of the main traffic safety issues today and despite measures being applied, the number of pedestrian deaths in traffic is not changing. According to the Pareto Rule, 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes and here the question arises whether we have already used these 20% of the most efficient measures. Todaythe European Union (EU) puts big hopes are on contemporary technologies, such as Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEB) and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). This decade, we can expect smarter vehicles with automatic brakes, and smarter infrastructure which can communicate with vehicles. Along this other profits technological development provides new opportunities for improving pedestrian safety. One of the most promising solutions is deployment of C-ITS systems at uncontrolled crossings. It would monitor the situation and warn the road users of potential dangers as well as make the vehicles brake automatically. However, before making large investments into this field, one has to be sure that this approach will work. The aim of this paper is to describe typical vehicle-pedestrian crash scenarios and to estimate whether a C-ITS warning system is able to prevent them. Research estimates the potential of this system and provides insights to its must-have features.
   Methods: To understand the situations in which the warning system should function, researchers carried out traffic conflict studies at uncontrolled crossings with traffic filmed in both winter and summer. They determined and described serious conflicts and, based on their scenarios, classified them into three types. Then, researchers selected the most critical conflict of each type and analysed whether warning signals can be provided to the vehicle and the driver early enough to prevent collisions. For these purposes, researchers used a modelling software for traffic accident investigation. To access the efficiency of the C-ITS warning system, researchers estimated the probability of preventing collisions and used the efficiency parameters of classical traffic calming measures.
   Results: The C-ITS warning system has good potential in preventing vehicle-pedestrian collisions at uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. It is remarkable and very promising that it would be able to prevent all types of conflicts analysed in the scope of this study by warning AEB-equipped vehicles. Warning the driver would be also effective, but the system work will largely depend on the quality of warning signals. An effective C-ITS warning system should be capable of predicting the trajectories and acceleration of road users as well as calculating the stopping distance of vehicles based on the coefficient of static friction. Study showed that in some cases, the system will have to give false positive alarms, but the fewer such alarms will be given, the more efficient the system will be. A disturbing or annoying C-ITS warning system cannot be considered effective.
   Conclusions: Road accident statistics contain general data about vehicle-pedestrian collisions at uncontrolled crossing, but there is few information about behavioral patterns leading to accidents. Based on large-scaled traffic studies, researchers were able to determine these patterns and described how road users act when being involved in a dangerous situation. This knowledge helped to model typical vehicle-pedestrian collisions as well as their possible scenarios. Researchers used the conflict models totest the C-ITS warning system and to understand its efficiency. The study results were implementedin a prototype that has been developed in Estonia and is being tested it in real traffic conditions of a smart city in the scope of the Finnish-Estonian project "FinEst Twins".The next steps are to analyze the test resultsand to conduct research to understand how to warn drivers (and pedestrians) most effectively.

AB  - Smart specialization strategies represent public policy initiatives to develop regions based on new combinations of knowledge and industries. The aim of this article is to enrich the theory and practice of smart specialization strategies (S3) by integrating the conceptualization of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship (KIE). We propose that knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship is necessary in order to specify how public and private support of KIE firms can be beneficial to develop new knowledge relevant to the fulfillment of specific sustainable development goals. We did so by further developing a conceptual model of innovation governance routines by integrating sustainability goals. We also illustrated our conceptual model through two case studies from the Swedish maritime cluster. By extrapolating from the combination of the conceptual model and two case studies, we make three propositions about the different strategic roles that KIE firms can play within a broader S3 policy setting, and in such a way as to promote sustainability-related outcomes.

AB  - Northern pike ( Esox lucius) spawning habitat and egg mortality were studied in three spawning areas in 2001 along the Swedish coast of the Baltic proper: the Blekinge Archipelago, Kalmar Sound and coastal freshwater streams. Spawning peaked during the last week of April in streams, at temperatures ranging from 7.7 to 8.9 degrees C and during the first week of May in brackish waters, at temperatures ranging from 8.9 to 13.8 degrees C. Spawning occurred in shallow waters, at depths between 0.2-1.5 m, but generally most of the spawn was found in the shallowest areas. In streams, eggs were mainly attached to emersed vegetation, while in brackish sites pike eggs were well scattered among flooded emersed plants, submersed plants and filamentous algae. Mean egg density varied between 469-1829 m(2) with the lowest density observed in Kalmar Sound. The calculated egg loss occurring from approximately one day after spawning to one day before hatching ranged from 41 +/- 7% in coastal streams to 67 +/- 6% in the Blekinge Archipelago and 100% in Kalmar Sound. The significant removal of eggs from spawning sites in Kalmar Sound and Blekinge was most likely due to predation from several fish species. In situ observations and stomach analyses suggested that many pike eggs in Kalmar Sound were lost to the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a species that presently dominate the littoral small fish community. This study therefore suggests that egg predation by sticklebacks and other fishes may be a possible cause of the reported poor recruitment of coastal pike populations in the Kalmar Sound region.

AB  - This study focuses on commitment as a key factor for successful collaboration in tourism. Taking a corporate governance perspective, we studied directors in tourist organization boards and examined possible effects of directors' strategic orientation (holistic orientation vs. stakeholder orientation) and compensation on organizational commitment. In line with recent behavioral perspectives on boards, this study accounted for board processes, including variables measuring intragroup conflict and effort norms. The sample included 307 directors in 98 Norwegian organizations. Findings underline the importance of recognizing the benefits of joint attempts and a community mindset among collaborators in tourist organizations. The results further indicated that board processes influence directors' organizational commitment. The effect of a holistic orientation toward the destination and the goals and values of the collaborative organizations was mediated by both the perception of intragroup conflict and effort norms in the board. In addition, effort norms mediated the relationship between compensation and commitment.

AB  - This paper describes a new method for the automatic detection of pit structures in airborne laser scanning data collected with at least five emitted pulses per square metre. Oppland County, Norway, has a large number of ancient iron production sites and hunting systems. Today, these are manifested as pits in the ground. The iron production sites were used 1400-700?yr ago, and consist of charcoal burning pits, often located in groups of four around a central oven, which also occasionally can be located as a small mound. The hunting systems were used 2000-500?yr ago, and consisted of concealed pitfall traps and wooden fences, located on deer trekking routes. The fences are gone, but the pits remain. Many of the iron production sites and hunting systems are located in forested areas. The current, traditional mapping of these is relatively poor, with many individual pits missing, and poor positional accuracy of the ones that are mapped. This means that overlays of cultural heritage sites cannot be trusted when planning new highways, residential areas, cabins, etc. Experience suggests that automatic detection is clearly superior to visual inspection of the lidar data in finding small pits or pits that are not easily visible. However, visual inspection is better at finding additional information as human interpretation based on archaeological knowledge can be applied. Combining these two methods secures a very good basis for subsequent field survey. In conclusion, we demonstrate that automatic detection of hunting systems and iron extraction sites in lidar data is a valuable tool in combination with visual inspection of the lidar data, prior to field survey. Provided that the point density of the lidar data is high enough, the field survey can be accomplished ten times faster compared with the traditional approach without lidar data.

AB  - 1. Many studies in northern Europe, North and South America, describe regional trends of population densification at altitudinal and polar tree lines during the 20th century. The purpose of this study was (1) to ascertain if this regeneration enhancement is present across the alpine ecotones of the Pyrenees, (2) if synchronous recruitment trends are common among the studied populations and (3) to determine the tree limit stability during recent decades.
   2. Twelve Pinus uncinata tree line populations were studied on the Iberian eastern range of the Pyrenees. Rectangular plots ranging from 940 to 7600 m(2) were set along the forest-alpine grassland transition; more than 3600 P. uncinata individuals were mapped. Tree size and age were used to establish the demographic structure at each stand, and to characterize abrupt or smooth transition patterns along the tree line ecotone. A new procedure for estimating missing rings in off-centre cores was developed to ensure a correct interval for the age-classes distribution analysis.
   3. Past and recent synchronous recruitment trends (mid 19th century, second half of the 20th century) were apparent at the tree line over the studied area of the Pyrenean range. The ecotone densification since the 1950s occurred in the context of climatic warming and substantial land use abandonment. Both gradual and step-like transition patterns in tree age and size along the ecotone were observed.
   4. Regeneration enhancement in the last approximately 30 years appears as an abrupt change in population age structures, which could indicate the importance of feedback mechanisms for tree line recruitment dynamics. In 50% of the surveyed tree lines ecotone densification has been coupled to tree limit shifts in the recent past. This indicates both great tree limit sensitivity to short-term climatic changes and the presence of differential tree line dynamics at a regional scale.
   5. Synthesis. The observed past and recent synchronous recruitment trends suggest the presence of regional climatic factors modulating tree line structure and dynamics. However, tree line dynamics in the Pyrenees have been widely affected by local anthropogenic activities. We suggest that the presence of step-like tree line transitions in tree age can be considered an evidence of recent human-induced disturbances when no other major natural disturbances affect the tree line dynamics.

AB  - The foraging strategy of a colony of social insects, e.g. ants, is made up of simple individual decisions being influenced by a series of factors like climatic conditions, properties and availability of food and competitive context. We studied the use of space, foraging success and competitive relationships in Formica cinerea around its nests in field conditions in the absence and in the presence of artificial food sources on sand dunes in Finland. Generally, the abundance of foragers was low around colonies. Sources in close proximity were mostly discovered. However, the fact that distant sources were sometimes preferred over discovered close sources during mass exploitation appeared to confer a certain sub-optimality upon the foraging strategy of the species. The use of baits allowed us to analyse the species' competitive position as well. Generally, rivals could dominate sources far from the nest of E cinerea, thus a facultative inhibition zone was established around the studied colonies. Although, mostly dominant in contests, E cinerea could give up food sources to rivals if these were already gathered on the bait. The mixture of submissive and aggressive features, which characterise E cinerea allows this species to adapt to the current competitive context and the availability of food sources.

AB  - What are the economic effects of the Ukraine war for Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of Europe? In this study, the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) sheds light on the immediate consequences on the one hand, but also on the medium-term structural changes caused by the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian crisis. Pre-war, almost 19 m people lived in those regions that are currently directly affected. Refugee inflows to the rest of Europe are likely to be at least three times greater than in 2015/2016. As Black Sea ports come under Russian assault, Ukraine has lost its ability to sell more than half of its exports, primarily agricultural commodities and metals. Western financial support will become ever more important as the war continues. Turning to Russia, sanctions will have a very serious impact on that country's economy and financial sector. Despite being partly hamstrung by the fact that a large proportion of Russian reserve assets are frozen in the EU and G7, the central bank managed to stabilise financial markets by a combination of confidence-building and hard-steering measures: capital controls, FX controls, regulatory easing for financial institutions, and a doubling of the key policy rate. The medium-term and long-term outlook is negative. As a result of the war and the sanctions, the rest of Europe faces a surge in already high inflation; this will weigh on real incomes and will depress economic growth. Many European countries rely heavily on Russia for oil and gas imports: import shares are over 75% in Czechia, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria with respect to natural gas; Slovakia, Lithuania, Poland, and Finland with respect to oil and petroleum; and Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Denmark, Lithuania, Greece, and Bulgaria with respect to solid fuels. Aside from energy, the fallout via trade for the rest of Europe is likely to be small. Non-energy trade and investment links between Russia and many European countries have declined in importance since 2013. There are four main areas of structural change and lasting impact for the EU (and Europe more broadly) as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. First, the EU will get more serious about defence. Second, the green transition will gather pace. Third, broader Eurasian economic integration will be unwound. And fourth, the EU accession prospects for countries in Southeast Europe could (and should) improve.

AB  - The effects of grazing by the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) on biomass and vegetation structure in a mountain snowbed habitat were studied using several grazer-exclosures kept for 5 or 15 yr. During the 5-yr exclusion experiment, the total biomass of mosses in particular, the main winter-food of lemmings, increased within fenced areas as compared to open control areas. In the 15-yr exclosures, Polytrichaceae mosses still dominated, but graminoids (Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carex bigelowii) had also increased. In these longer-term exclosures, dead plant material, consisting of Polytrichaceae moss and graminoid necromass and other plant litter, had increased. By contrast, Kiaeria moss and lichens were absent or had low biomass after 15 yr of grazer exclosure, probably as a result of competitive exclusion. The results suggest that the plant biomass in such low productivity mountain snowbeds can be reduced to a low level by grazing. Grazing also determines the dominance relationships in the plant community and prevents accumulation of plant litter. The observed effects of grazing are inconsistent with hypotheses suggesting that herbivory is of little importance in low productivity environments, but rather support the exploitation ecosystems hypothesis predicting strong grazing impact in such low productivity environments.

AB  - In the present research, a methodology is developed to determine the relationship between the variables that define the use of liquefied natural gas in short sea shipping in Europe, through the use of data-mining techniques. The project takes place in the European space, which includes data from 30 countries, the 28 members of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. A Bayesian network is constructed with the 35 indicators selected, which are classified into five different categories: international trade and transport, economy and finance, population and social condition, environment and energy, and institutional and political. It is found that capacity of liquefied natural gas regasification terminals under construction and modal distribution of cargo transport by inland waters are the two root nodes of the network. In addition, the variables of transport and international trade and economy and finance become the most important in the decision to implement liquefied natural gas as marine fuel, while those of environment and energy and population and condition are the most dependent on the network.

AB  - Forty plots were selected in an old-growth beech forest (Biological Reserve of La Tillaie, Fontainebleau State Forest, France), to embrace the whole range of site conditions and phases of vegetation dynamics. Soils are sandy, thus the nutrient status of the topsoil is very poor except when trees have access to an underlying limestone layer. The study was focused on the role of calcium in the sustainability of the beech ecosystem. Calcium is mostly redistributed through leaf litter accretion and the activity of litter-consuming organisms, but other sources are fallen wood and uprooted mounds. In each of the 40 plots, earthworm species were sampled, and measurements were taken in order to describe humus profiles, growth of adult trees, litter quantity and quality, and access to lime. Densities of soil-dwelling earthworms, calcium content of beech leaf litter, height of tallest tries and depth of the limestone layer were correlated, indicating a gradient of soil fertility which mainly results from long-term interactions between soil organisms and trees in varying geological conditions. Possible causal relationships and implications of calcium turnover for nature conservation were discussed in the light of existing knowledge.

AB  - Achill yawls, originally introduced to Ireland as ships' boats aboard Norwegian merchantmen, developed into distinct working vessels along Achill Island's shores during the 19th century. These boats were subsequently modified for recreational racing in the mid-20th century. Despite changes to their design, they are often nostalgically viewed as traditional symbols of an Achill islander identity, though their popularity may have been prompted by late-19th-century British legislation. The authors take an ethnographic approach in interpreting Achill yawls over time, contextualizing their social functions through an exploration of primary historical and photographic archives, extant vessels, and interviews with Achill islanders.

AB  - Modeling fish community responses to dam removal is an emerging field of study as dam removals become more common, but uncertainties concerning recovery time and community stability remain. In Europe, an EU-wide biodiversity strategy plans to restore around 25,000 km of rivers to free-flowing status, which emphasizes the importance of being able to predict fish community responses after dam removal. We developed a multi-species size spectrum model for a fish community in the Mo & BULL;rrum River in Sweden to identify possible outcomes after a dam was removed in 2020. Electrofishing monitoring before the dam removal was used to calibrate the model. We projected multiple scenarios into the future to explore patterns of community stability, individual species responses, and recovery time while varying parameters related to dam removal mortality, base resource rate change, and maximum recruitment change. We created 30 hypothetical scenarios using an abrupt change perspective (parameters are step-based) and 30 scenarios using a gradual change perspective (parameters are smooth). In both perspectives, dam removal mortality and a decreasing resource rate reduced community biomass and delayed recovery time compared to pre-dam removal conditions. Our results demonstrate that recovery from a dam removal scenario is not necessarily a benefit for all species. In scenarios where dam removal practices or dam failures cause high mortality events and sustained impacts on base trophic level resources, recovery of pre-removal biomass may take decades, while community stability may be unstable for twice that time-period. Our study shows that size spectrum models can be applied to dam removal scenarios to explore potential recovery outcomes, particularly from a risk avoidance perspective. A benefit of using such an approach is the relatively low data requirements needed to perform projections (e.g., present species, fish growth rates, relative fish abundance). Implementing this model in other river systems, particularly at the reach scale, can help river restoration and management assess tradeoffs associated with different habitat restoration approaches prior to committing to a dam removal plan.

AB  - One aim of this paper was to present flows and balances of K, P, and Zn at a barn level for an organic and a conventional farming system, and compare the systems with respect to agronomic sustainability. A second aim was to identify internal on-farm flows of major concern for the environment. We define barn balance as the balance between element flows entering and leaving the barn. The flows of potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and zinc (Zn) through the barn compartments were separated between an organically and a conventionally managed farming system. The study comprised 1 year. The area of the organic system was 59 ha and that of the conventional system 45 ha, with 50 dairy cows in each system. Feed, bedding, tap water, and milk were recorded and sampled monthly. The manure and urine were sampled in conjunction with spreading. In comparison with the organic system, the conventional system produced more milk per cow and per hectare, but to reach that target, the conventional system was more dependent on land outside the farm for feed production than the organic system. As a consequence, the total internal flows from feed crop production were larger in the organic system. The concentration of K in organic silage was significantly lower than that in conventional silage. The concentrations of K, P, and Zn in the other materials studied did not differ between systems. The barn balances of the two systems were similar to each other. The study showed a large internal flow of K, equal flows of P, and smaller internal flows of Zn within a dairy farm as compared to the animal-associated flows through the farm gate. For K, about 70% of the total amount in farm feed crops and purchased feed was recovered in recorded outputs. For P the recovery was close to 100%, whereas for Zn, more of the element was found in the outflow than in the inflow. The imbalances of K and Zn represented flows that would not have been recognised in a farm-gate balance, but which could have a considerable impact on soil accumulation, long-term soil fertility, and losses to the surrounding environment.

AB  - A basic challenge to successful management and conflict resolution is to correctly identify the spatial scale at which strategies for harvesting are developed. For commercially exploited marine fish, distributional boundaries of many stocks are based on the premise that productivity is similar at spatial scales that represent a small fraction of an individual's potential migration distance. Within such confined geographic regions, differences among individual life history traits-primary determinants of population productivity-are assumed to be negligible. The empirical basis for these assumptions bears re-examination for some widely distributed species, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), for which there is evidence that life history structuring is evident at much finer scales than previously thought. Here, we focus on a unique system in the Norwegian Skagerrak, divided into inner and outer fjord habitats between which cod movement across distances of a few kilometres is limited and populations show signals of genetic differentiation. Based on back-calculated length-at-age data, cod in the inner fjord are systematically smaller at young ages (1-5 years) and are characterized by shorter asymptotic body lengths than cod in the outer fjord. Our work on growth and life history supports genetic analyses which indicate that productivity and resilience of widely distributed marine fish are likely to differ at considerably smaller spatial scales than those delineated by traditional stock management boundaries.

TI  - The spur goad from Skegrie in Scania, Sweden Evidence of elite interaction between Viking Age Scandinavians and Western Slays
T2  - FORNVANNEN-JOURNAL OF SWEDISH ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - The present paper focuses on a small metal artefact discovered in 2008 during archaeological excavations that preceded the construction of the E6 road leading from Trelleborg to Vellinge in Scania, Sweden. The object under consideration is a copper-alloy goad which originally formed part of a very particular type of Viking Age spurs known from the West Slavic area, predominantly from modern-day Poland. Spurs of this kind are lavishly decorated with animal motifs, probably referring to pre-Christian Slavic mythology, and it is argued that they were emblematic objects used by West Slavic militarized elites which emerged in the turbulent time of state formation in the late tenth and eleventh centuries AD. Due to their rich symbolic content, probably manifesting distinct group identity of their owners, it is highly unlikely that the zoomorphic spurs would have served as objects of trade and exchange. Therefore, the goad discussed in this paper is seen not as a foreign "import" but as important evidence of cultural interaction between the representatives of the highest echelons of Scandinavian and West Slavic societies.

AB  - The circular economy is among the key contemporary policy goals both in Europe and in Finland. Therefore, sustainability and life cycle thinking are increasingly the center of attention. In addition, wood and bioproduct companies have faced many challenges in Finland and the closure or restructuring of many large-scale industrial sites have caused many regional changes for both society and the private sector. The EU's targets to promote the circular economy and become a recycling society bring about many changes and provide new opportunities. This study addresses two different components of circular economy development in the forest sector through case studies. The first case study was a regional study on sustainability driven competitive advantage within forest sector companies and the method applied was a questionnaire survey targeted at both large and small forest sector companies in the Kymenlaakso region. The second case study was about the potential for cascading recovered solid wood in wood products and wood working companies and the method employed was interviewing company and association representatives. The findings of the first case study indicate that material and energy efficiency are important in the context of circular economy and bioeconomy development. They also indicate the importance of EU and national level public steering and sustainability considerations and that there is a need for more focus on life cycle thinking in the future. The findings of the second case study indicate that without inducements, legislative obligations or demand from the construction sector or other customers, the potential for the wide-scale cascading of solid wood in Finland is very limited. The most promising cascading opportunities are the reuse and preparing for reuse of wooden packages and furniture. In addition, the results suggest that life-cycle-assessthent for different end-of-life scenarios for solid wood products could give more reliable information about different options from an environmental point of view.

AB  - Even though large parts of a municipal administration's work are aligned with social sustainability, this dimension has been somewhat more challenging and there seems to be a vast diversity in how it is approached. Academic literature on the systematic organization of this work is sparse. The aim of this study was to understand how Swedish municipalities organize their work with social sustainability and to find best practices. A survey among 21 municipalities and follow-up interviews with three of them were conducted. The study revealed that the organization of social sustainability work varies considerably among municipalities and that no simple patterns relating to size or existing organizational structures can be detected. Each municipality seems to be finding its own way and is more or less successful in strategically working with this area. Best practice focused on creating additional structures for collaboration across departments, with external actors, and across sectors to at least partly overcome the silo approach engrained in a municipal structure. It was also connected to the active involvement of leaders, clear mandates, and that a common vision for social sustainability was communicated. These lessons can be transferred to other municipalities and help them move towards social sustainability in a strategic way.

AB  - Accurately quantifying soil base cation pool sizes is essential to interpreting the sustainability of forest harvests from element mass-balance studies. The soil-exchangeable pool is classically viewed as the bank of "available" base cations in the soil, withdrawn upon by plant uptake and leaching and refilled by litter decomposition, atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering. The operational definition of this soil bank as the exchangeable (salt-extractable) pools ignores the potential role of "other" soil nutrient pools, including microbial biomass, clay interlayer absorbed elements, and calcium oxalate. These pools can be large relative to "exchangeable" pools. Thus neglecting these other pools in studies examining the sustainability of biomass extractions, or need for nutrient return, limits our ability to gauge the threat or risk of unsustainable biomass removals. We examine a set of chemical extraction data from a mature Norway spruce forest in central Sweden and compare this dataset to ecosystem flux data gathered from the site in previous research. The 0.2 M HCl extraction released large pools of Ca, K, Mg, and Na, considerably larger than the exchangeable pools. Where net losses of base cations are predicted from biomass harvest, exchangeable pools may not be sufficient to support more than a single 65-year forest rotation, but acid-extractable pools are sufficient to support many rotations of net-ecosystem losses. We examine elemental ratios, soil clay and carbon contents, and pool depth trends to identify the likely origin of the HCl-extractable pool. No single candidate compound class emerges, as very strongly supported by the data, as being the major constituent of the HCl-extractable fraction. A combination of microbial biomass, fine grain, potentially shielded, easily weatherable minerals, and non-structural clay interlayer bound potassium may explain the size and distribution of the acid-extractable base cation pool. Sequential extraction techniques and isotope-exchange measurements should be further developed and, if possible, complemented with spectroscopic techniques to illuminate the identity of and flux rates through these important, and commonly overlooked, nutrient pools.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) are among the elements that are most mined, processed and used in modern industry and society. A realistic estimate of the diffuse contamination that has left a footprint on soil during the last 200 years by worldwide industrialization requires recognition and assessment of the dominant natural and anthropogenic sources. The relations between geogenic, anthropogenic, and biogenic Cr and Ni sources are estimated from eight large-scale geochemical surveys, by comparing the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the elements in top-and sub soil using cumulative probability (CP) diagrams. This method makes it possible to estimate the effect of long-term diffuse contamination on soil without monitoring. The method offers a cheaper and more reliable method for estimating dif-fuse contamination at the continental to regional scale than classical monitoring methods. The impact of diffuse con-tamination can be recognized at the low-concentration end while strong local contamination is shown as a distort at the high-concentration end of the distribution. Chromium, due to its structural similarities with essential nutrients, shows a clear biological signal in the CP-diagram. The bio-adjustment of Cr and Ni limits the accuracy of the diffuse contamination estimates. Combining CDF analysis with spatial mapping provides insight into the dominant contami-nation processes that distort the top soil CDF relative to the sub soil CDF. For both elements, a diffuse contamination signal of <1 mg/kg is obtained for soils at the European scale. Agricultural soil is affected by contamination from farm-ing practices and shows higher excess Cr and Ni in top soil than forest soil. Although the world has faced several cen-turies of industrial development and Cr and Ni are used "everywhere", this is not reflected in surface soil at the continental to regional scale. The regional distribution of both elements is dominated by natural sources and processes.

AB  - The first 33 years of primary geo-ecological succession is investigated in the pioneer zone of the Storbreen glacier foreland using the chronosequence approach. Pitfall trapping of invertebrates and the sampling of higher and lower plants and habitat factors from quadrats were used on three replicate transects across a till plain accurately dated by annually monitored glacier front variations combined with the mapping of annual moraine ridges. Unstable, saturated sediments deglacierized for <1 year are colonized first by very large numbers of Collembola and a small number of epigeal beetles and spiders. Improved drainage, loss of fine matrix by pervection and frost sorting lead to the development of an active stone pavement after 6-21 years, which is colonized by sparse herbaceous perennials, a slowly-developing cryptogamic crust dominated by mosses, and moderately abundant epigeal beetles, spiders and the glacier harvestman (Mitopus morio). Further soil development and stabilization of the stone pavement lead, via a transition phase (21-26 years), to a fast developing ecosystem (26-33 years) in which the cover of most of the plants and pitfall catches of invertebrate groups are increasing rapidly (including a resurgence in Collembola catches and the spread of Racomitrium moss, terrestrial lichens and shrubs). Spatial heterogeneity reflects gradual successional trajectories related to small variations in physical habitat conditions. The sequence of changes is summarized in a conceptual geo-ecological model in which abiotic and biotic processes combine to drive the pioneer stages of both invertebrate and plant succession with little evidence of highly integrated biotic communities.

AB  - The Bioshale project, involving 13 partners throughout Europe, is co-funded by the European Commission under the FP6 program. The main objective of this project (which started in October 2004) is to identify and develop innovative biotechnological processes for "eco-efficient" exploitation of metal-rich, black shale ores. Three extensive deposits have been selected for R&D actions. These are: (i) a site (in Talvivaara, Finland) that, at the outset of the project, had not been exploited; (ii) a deposit (in Lubin, Poland) that is currently being actively mined, and (iii) a third site (in Mansfeld, Germany) where the ore had been actively mined in the past, but which is no longer exploited. The black shale ores contain base (e.g. copper and nickel), precious (principally silver) and PGM metals, but also high contents of organic matter that potentially handicap metal recovery by conventional techniques.
   The main technical aspects of the work plan can be summarized as: (i) evaluation of the geological resources and selection of metal-bearing components; (ii) selection of biological consortia to be tested; (iii) assessment of bioprocessing routes, including hydrometallurgical processing; (iv) techno-economic evaluation of new processes from mining to metal recovery including social, and (v) assessing the environmental impacts of biotechnological compared to conventional processing of the ores. An overview of the main results obtained to date are presented, with special emphasis on the development of bioleaching technologies for metal recovery that can be applied to multielement concentrates and black shale ores.

AB  - Disturbances alter composition, structure, and functioning of forest ecosystems, and their legacies persist for decades to centuries. We investigated how temperate forest landscapes may recover their carbon (C) after severe wind and bark beetle disturbance, while being exposed to climate change. We used the forest landscape and disturbance model iLand to quantify (i) the recovery times of the total ecosystem C, (ii) the effect of climate change on C recovery, and (iii) the differential factors contributing to C recovery. We reconstructed a recent disturbance episode (2008-2016) based on Landsat satellite imagery, which affected 39% of the forest area in the 16,000 ha study landscape. We subsequently simulated forest recovery under a continuation of business-as usual management until 2100.
   Our results indicated that the recovery of the pre-disturbance C stocks (C payback time) was reached 17 years after the end of the disturbance episode. The C stocks of a theoretical undisturbed development trajectory were reached 30 years after the disturbance episode (C sequestration parity). Drier and warmer climates delayed simulated C recovery. Without the fertilizing effect of CO2, C payback times were delayed by 5-9 years, while C parity was not reached within the 21st century. Recovery was accelerated by an enhanced C uptake compared to undisturbed conditions (disturbance legacy sink effect) that persisted for 35 years after the disturbance episode.
   Future climate could have negative impacts on forest recovery and thus further amplify climate change through C loss from ecosystems, but the effect is strongly contingent on the magnitude and persistence of alleviating CO2 effects. Our modelling study highlights the need to consider both negative and positive effects of disturbance (i.e., C loss immediately after an event vs. enhanced C uptake of the recovering forest) in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of disturbance effects on the forest C cycle.

AB  - High-level nuclear waste (HLW) is a controversial and risky issue. For the next 100 years, HLW will be subject to public policy decisions and value assessments. Physically safe, technically stable and socio-economically sustainable HLW-management will top the agenda. That must be accomplished in a society whose segments are both stable and in a rapid state of flux, under the influence of global as well as national factors, private interests as well as the vagaries of national politics. Among the challenges to be faced is how to codify responsibilities of nuclear industry, governments and international organisations, and any adopted management policy must attain legitimacy at the local, national, regional and global levels. All such considerations raise questions about the practical and theoretical knowledge. This special issue will address these questions by exploring HLW-management in Canada, France, Germany, India, Sweden, the UK and the USA. Special emphasis will be placed on highlighting national contexts, current trends and uncertainties, with relevance to a socially sustainable contemporary and future HLW-management.

AB  - Purpose To investigate car use among newly retired people, to explore to what extent car transport is used for everyday mobility and how it is valued in comparison to other transport modes.
   Methods The data consists of travel diaries and qualitative interviews with 24 individuals, aged between 61 and 67, living in a middle-sized Swedish city. They were recruited via the local branch of one of the main associations of pensioners, one large employer in the municipality, and through another study. The informants filled in a travel diary during 1 week that were analysed by VISUAL-TimePAcTS, an application for visualising and exploring activity diary data. The semi-structured qualitative interviews were analysed using a qualitative content analysis.
   Results The car was used for several trips daily and often for short trips. The informants had a lot of everyday projects that they would not be able to perform if they did not have access to a car. The importance of the car does not seem to have changed upon retirement, albeit it is partly used for other reasons than before. The informant's social context implies new space-time constraints. Commitments to family members, engagement in associations and spouses' occupations affect how much and when they use the car, and their overall mobility.
   Conclusions In contrast to much research on older people's mobility that has studied slightly older people, this study have focused on a specific group that are relatively healthy, well-off, and have the possibility to choose between different modes of transport. By combining travel diaries and qualitative interviews, we have explored how newly retired people reason as regard their travel behaviour but also how they actually travel. Although the car was used more than other transport modes, being able to walk and cycle now that they had more time as retirees was highly valued. Our results indicate that urban residents that are retiring now and in the future are a key target group in transport planning when it comes to reduce car use in favour of slow modes of transport.

AB  - The communications industry is experiencing a rapid growth in introduction and diffusion of new services and applications, particularly in the areas of wireless and broad band. This rapid growth is driven by the evolution of communications technologies and regulatory policies. The new services are also displacing some of the demands for traditional wireline services such as voice communications. To meet these increasing and shifting demands, communications service providers need to effectively forecast such demands for short term and long run in order to plan and deploy sufficient infrastructure and operations capabilities.
   Demand for wireless services are growing much faster than anything we have experienced in the past. In some countries, such as Sweden and Italy, cell phone density has already exceeded 100%. The key questions for infrastructure planners are: 1) what is the expected saturation level for wireless cell phones? How fast are we getting there? How much does it vary from country to country and why? 2) How to forecast short term demands and substitution rates for various services in a selected region.
   This paper presents the results of an analysis to forecast saturation levels for cell phones in US and a number of European countries based on trend data from 1984 through 2004, using technology diffusion models. The authors discuss the differences among the countries and some of the contributing factors such as existing infrastructure and cultural differences. The authors conclude with some of the challenges for service providers responding to the transition issues from wireline to wireless services and integration of operations across technology domains.

AB  - BackgroundKnowledge about non-surgical weight loss (WL) is scarce among people with severe obesity (SO). Lifestyle changes are primarily self-driven, occasionally accompanied by professional guidance and weight-management support. Weight regain and intervention discontinuation are common challenges among guidance and support programmes. In the current study, we describe a model of meaningful strategies for maintaining WL after SO based on the experiences of successful cases.MethodsAiming to investigate the experiences of WL and weight loss maintenance (WLM) (& GE;5 years) following SO, we designed a qualitative study. Ten adults of Norwegian ethnicity, eight women and two men aged from 27 to 59, participated in individual in-depth interviews. We recruited participants living in rural districts and cities across all four regions of Norway. The interviews concentrated on participants' experiences of losing weight and maintaining a lower weight over the long term. The transcripts were analysed with a rigorous method for thematic cross-case analysis, namely, systematic text condensation (STC).ResultsParticipants identified four experiential themes at the core of long-term WLM: (a) Owning the decision, (b) Creating self-reinforcement, (c) Sustaining a lifestyle-forming identity, and (d) Selecting support appropriate to one's own situation. These core themes represent the intentional level, functioning both as the foundation of and the momentum for sustaining WL. On the behavioural level, participants continued to take action for change, obtain results, record and reflect on their efforts and milestones, observe what worked and felt good, and receive recognition from others, thereby realising changes.ConclusionBased on these results, we propose a model of WLM after SO, suggesting that practices toward WLM on the behavioural level achieve meaning and sustainability through their relationship with a core intentional level found across participants' experiences. One implication is that the relationship between the intentional and behavioural levels might be more meaningful when discussing long-term WLM than the behaviours themselves.

AB  - Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are heavily dependent on marine prey, in particular ice-associated seals, which they hunt on landfast sea ice or free-floating pack ice. Dramatic current (and predicted) losses of sea ice habitat make it increasingly important to gain more knowledge of the relative use by bears of all types of prey from the marine food web as well as from terrestrial sources. This study uses frequency of occurrence of food items in 119 polar bear scats sampled on the sea ice as well as on shore in coastal areas in the Svalbard Archipelago, mainly in spring, between 2003 and 2010 to explore the diet of bears in the region. Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) occurred in 62.2 % (CI 52.8-70.9 %) of the scat samples examined. Various terrestrial plants (32.8 %, CI 24.4-42.0 %) and marine algae (21.8 %, CI 14.8-30.4 %) also occurred frequently in the scats; the significance of this high occurrence of plants and algae is not clear. Bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and various bird species constituted only minor components of the diet, while Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) occurred in 9.2 % (CI 4.7-15.9 %) of the scats, indicating that this species may play a more important role than previously reported. The novel combination of genetic analyses of material in the fecal samples along with detailed exploration of the physical-structural properties of prey hairs and plant parts provided a much fuller picture of the diet of polar bears than would have been possible from observational studies of polar bear predation behavior alone. This approach may provide an important tool for monitoring the responses of polar bears to ongoing ecosystem changes that will result from continued warming in the Arctic.

AB  - BackgroundNon-natural mortality in children and adolescents is a global public health problem that varies widely from country to country. Data on child and adolescent maltreatment are not readily available, and mortality due to violent causes is also underestimated.MethodsInjury-related mortality rates (overall and by specific causes) from 2000 to 2018 in selected European countries were analysed to observe mortality patterns in children and adolescents using data from the Eurostat database. Age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated for each country. Joinpoint regression analysis with a significance level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals was performed for mortality trends.ResultsChildren and adolescent mortality from non-natural causes decreased significantly in Europe from 10.48 around 2005 to 5.91 around 2015. The Eastern countries (Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic) had higher rates; while Spain, Denmark, Italy, and the United Kingdom had the lowest. Rates for European Country declined by 5.10% per year over the entire period. Larger downward trends were observed in Ireland, Spain and Portugal; smaller downward trends were observed for Eastern countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia) and Finland. Among specific causes of death, the largest decreases were observed for accidental causes (-5.9%) and traffic accidents (-6.8%).ConclusionsMortality among children and adolescents due to non-natural causes has decreased significantly over the past two decades. Accidental events and transport accidents recorded the greatest decline in mortality rates, although there are still some European countries where the number of deaths among children and adolescents from non-natural causes is high. Social, cultural, and health-related reasons may explain the observed differences between countries.

AB  - Pretreatment of dilute suspensions leads to separation of water and solids. Reuse of both water and flushed solids can be smart both economically and environmentally. Many industries produce effluents with mixtures of water and solid particles. Traditionally, the effluent is discharged via a sewer to a receiving watercourse. Separation by microfiltration (MF) is a well suited method for recovery of production materials in dilute suspensions. Micromembranes typically have pore sizes of 0.2 mu m. Larger particles are therefore retained and the permeate is free of suspended solids. Bacteria, for example, are larger than 0.2 mu m. Removal of bacteria by MF therefore, may be defined as a physical "disinfection" process. The china producer Figgjo AS is big its Norway. The company produces cups and plates for restaurants, cruise-vessels and individual homes. The production of china results in effluents rich in clay and glaze particles. Traditionally, clay is difficult to separate without space-consuming and chemical-intensive processes such as coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. After installing clay separation by MF, Figgjo AS has nearly eliminated clay in the effluent. The membrane plant efficiently concentrates and recovers clay for reuse in the production of china. The factory recovers 35 tons of clay annually by :MF. The savings in clay equates to a payback of the investment in MF equipment in 5 years. Compared to chemical coagulation for clay separation, the payback time is less than a year for a MF plant. There is no reuse of clay after chemical precipitation, and there is a sludge handling cost; transportation and sludge deposit. The operation of the MF plant is automatic. The permeate flux is around 50 l/m(2)/h (lmh) at a cross-flow velocity of 2 m/s and an operational pressure of maximum 2 kg/cm(2). The plant is flushed once a day with clean water. No chemical cleaning of the membranes is necessary.

AB  - The unique biodiversity and plant composition of peatlands rely on a mix of different water sources: precipitation, runoff, and groundwater (GW). Methods used to delineate areas of ecosystem groundwater dependence, such as vegetation mapping and solute tracer studies, are indirect and lack the potential to assess temporal changes in hydrology, information needed in GW management. This paper outlines a new methodology for mapping groundwater-dependent areas (GDAs) in peatlands using a H-2 and O-18 isotope mass balance method. The approach reconstructs the initial isotopic composition of the peat pore water in the uppermost peat layer before its modification by evaporation. It was assumed that pore water in this layer subject to evaporation is a two-component mixture consisting of GW and precipitation input from the month preceding the sampling period. A Bayesian Monte Carlo isotope mixing model was applied to calculate the proportions of GW and rainwater in the sampled pore water and to assess uncertainties. The approach revealed large spatial variability in the contribution of GW to the pore water present in the top layer of peatland, covering the range from approximately 0 to 100%. Results show that the current GW protection zones determined by Finnish legislation do not cover the GDAs in peatlands and highlight a need for better classification of groundwater-dependent ecosystems and conceptualization of aquifer-ecosystem interactions. Our approach offers an efficient tool for mapping GDAs and quantifying the contribution of GW to peatland pore water. However, more studies are needed to test the method for different peatland types.

AB  - For rivers or streams with waterfalls, water withdrawal for multiple uses can lead to potential conflicts of interest. The question arises to what extent water withdrawal impairs the appearance and acoustics of waterfalls. A data set was analyzed of 15 waterfalls of different morphological types in Switzerland, Austria, and Norway. It comprises discharge measurements as well as photo imaging and sound level measurements. The variations of waterfall appearance and sound level decreased after reaching a threshold discharge value for all investigated morphological waterfall types. For low discharges, visible and acoustics changes were more significant compared to higher discharges. Acoustics changes were less pronounced than visual changes. The acoustics and visual extent of a water withdrawal can be calculated with a novel assessment equation using a normalized discharge. Based on an impact intensity, which is a function of the extent of the water withdrawal and the nonmonetary waterfall value, the selected residual discharge can be evaluated. In addition, a software tool was developed to enable a sensitivity analysis of the required residual discharge to maintain a certain waterfall appearance.

AB  - Evaluations hold the potential to support decision-making so that current global challenges related to climate and energy can be addressed; however, as the challenges are becoming increasingly large and complex, new and transformative evaluation approaches are called for. Such transformative evaluation in turn builds on an extended and more deliberate use of evaluations. This study focuses on the current evaluation use practices among Swedish state agencies who are commissioning and/or conducting evaluations within climate and energy-related areas. Building on focus group sessions with four agencies and a structured interview questionnaire answered by representatives at five state agencies, the results shed light on how informants perceive the current practices of using evaluations, following the models of use presented in the evaluation literature. These results show perceived use as mainly instrumental or conceptual, along with showing an overall emphasis on models of use that are deemed constructive for moving towards transformative evaluations. The results also outline key benefits and challenges related to the adoption of a transformative evaluation approach. Such benefits include a more structured planning and use of evaluations, while challenges relate to institutional barriers and mandates to coordinate evaluations on a transformative scale.

AB  - Formaldehyde is one of the most important intermediate chemicals and has been produced industrially since 1889. Formaldehyde is a key feedstock in several industries like resins, polymers, adhesives, and paints, making it one of the most valuable chemicals in the world. However, not many studies have been dedicated to reviewing the production of this economically important product. In this review paper, we study the leading commercial processes for formaldehyde production and compare them with recent advancements in catalysis and novel processes. This paper compares, in extensive detail, the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of water ballast process (or BASF process), methanol ballast process, and Formox process. The thermodynamics of the reactions involved in the formaldehyde production process was investigated using HSC Chemistry (TM) software (Outotec Oyj, Espoo, Finland). Exergy analysis was carried out for the natural gas to methanol process and the methanol ballast process for formaldehyde production. The former process was simulated using Aspen HYSYS (TM) and the latter using Aspen Plus (TM) software (Aspen technology, Burlington, MA, USA). The yield and product specifications from the simulation results closely matched with published experimental data. The exergy efficiencies of the natural gas to synthesis gas via steam reforming, methanol synthesis, and formaldehyde synthesis processes were calculated as 60.8%, 61.6%, and 66%, respectively. The overall exergy efficiency of natural gas conversion into formaldehyde was found to be only 43.2%. The main sources of exergy losses were the steam reformer and methanol loss in formaldehyde synthesis process. Despite high conversions and selectivities of these processes, the low exergy efficiency suggests that innovations in formaldehyde production processes could give a more sustainable product. Novel methods of direct conversion of natural gas or synthesis gas into formaldehyde will improve the exergy efficiency, but the conversion rate must also be increased with advancements in catalysis.

AB  - Industrial energy efficiency is crucial for energy cost saving and sustainable competitiveness, but its potential is not exploited due to several barriers. Previous literature has pointed out that, among the most effective means, energy management in industrial companies could bring a valuable contribution. Therefore, it is crucial to assess and evaluate the energy management status in an organisation so to undertake the most appropriate improvement actions. So far, literature has neither described the fundamental characteristics of energy management practices, nor specifically developed an assessment model to support industrial decision-makers. Stemming from those research gaps, the present work presents and discusses an innovative energy management assessment model based on a novel characterization of energy management practices. We validated and applied the model through case studies among large Italian and Swedish manufacturing companies, both proving the model to be able to thoroughly describe the energy management status and benchmarking the adoption level of energy management practices with respect to specific baselines. The model highlights both strengths and critical areas in an industrial company's energy management, thus offering a valuable support to drive further improvement activities. The work concludes with interesting suggestions for industrial decision-makers and policy-makers, sketching also some further research avenues.

AB  - Additional information concerning the quality of growing stock in forests has been obtained for the first time in Baden-Wurrttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz during the course of Germany's second national forest inventory (BWI 2; conducted during the period 2001-2002). In this article, the quality assessment-called stem quality rating method-is described with a special focus on its potential to provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the growing stock's quality distribution. As a main result, the article presents and illustrates a model-based quantification of single tree and stand/site variable effects on the quality distribution of Norway spruce. Single tree variables showing a significant effect are diameter at breast height (DBH), height-DBH-ratio (h/d-value), age and distance to forest edge. Additional stand/site variables which have a significant effect are altitude, terrain slope, stand type and inventory team. Due to the ordinal type of the response variable, a categorical regression model is applied. Nonlinear effects of predictor variables were detected and modeled by integration of smoothing spline terms. Validating model predictions with regard to expert knowledge in forestry led to the integration of simple constraints in the linear predictor, which controls whether category-specific effects are fitted or not. The resulting model could be described as a vector generalized additive non-proportional odds regression model. This improved insight into the determination of stem quality could be applied in optimization studies to derive optimal silvicultural treatments and in the setting up of management guidelines. Assuming constant relationships between predictor and response variables over time, the combined application with growth simulators allows for a prediction of future joint quality and size class assortment distributions. Finally, the model would allow for a sustainability control of stem quality over time if a consecutive inventory will be conducted during the course of the third German national forest inventory (BWI 3).

AB  - How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often, the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the nation's will. While some are pleased with it, others might show resentment. Coronavirus (COVID-19) brought a mix of similar emotions from the nations towards the decisions taken by their respective governments. Social media was bombarded with posts containing both positive and negative sentiments on the COVID-19, pandemic, lockdown, and hashtags past couple of months. Despite geographically close, many neighboring countries reacted differently to one another. For instance, Denmark and Sweden, which share many similarities, stood poles apart on the decision taken by their respective governments. Yet, their nation's support was mostly unanimous, unlike the South Asian neighboring countries where people showed a lot of anxiety and resentment. The purpose of this study is to analyze reaction of citizens from different cultures to the novel Coronavirus and people's sentiment about subsequent actions taken by different countries. Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) models used for estimating the sentiment polarity and emotions from extracted tweets have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the sentiment140 dataset. The use of emoticons showed a unique and novel way of validating the supervised deep learning models on tweets extracted from Twitter.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that the integration of civil protection, crisis management and the machinery of risk assessment lies at the heart of current securitization thereby constituting a shift in focus from war and military operations to all-risk perspectives. This article explores how these processes of integration intersect with gendered power dynamics at a practical level, by focusing on tensions and conflicting views on how this work should be organized and understood. The article is based on a study of professionals who analyse risks and vulnerability at a local and regional level in Sweden. The material consists of observations and interviews. The analysis shows that although these professionals' work is contrasted to masculine-coded operative professions, it seems to be the case that masculine-coded approaches and forms of expertise are given priority. This is reproduced through the creation of an aura of neutrality and an attitude towards 'getting the job done'.

AB  - The size and composition of the nematode assemblage in soil beneath faecal material derived from reindeer treated with ivermectin oral, or ivermectin subcutaneous formulations in early winter in northern Finland, was studied over a two-year period. This study was performed on both ungrazed and grazed areas that typify the reindeer habitat of the region and comparisons were also made with soil nematodes recovered from soils receiving untreated faecal material. Although significant differences in numbers of soil nematode fauna were observed between treatments on individual occasions, none of the differences occurred consistently with treatment, or with time. These results showed no adverse environmental impact of the faeces of reindeer given either formulation of ivermectin in early winter on soil nematode communities in subsequent years.

AB  - We compared reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) fright responses towards a directly approaching snow-kiter or skier in Norefjell-Reinsjofjell, Norway during winter in 2006-2007. Fright response distances sampled in the field were significantly longer when approached by a snow-kiter than by a skier. A simulation model predicts a different outcome of daytime disturbances for reindeer from free ranging snow-kiters versus skiers confined to prepared ski trails. The expected number of encounters with reindeer increases linearly with increasing number of snow-kiters until it reaches a threshold level and then stabilizes, but the number of snow-kiters reaching a threshold will vary depending on the speed of the kite (252 snow-kiters at 8.8 km h(-1) or 96 at 20 km h(-1)). The relative loss of habitat and daytime feeding for reindeer following encounters with snow-kiters moving randomly within their range increases progressively up to a 100% reduction at 241 or 111 snow-kiters at a speed of 8.8 and 20 km h(-1), respectively. Above this number of snow-kiters, reindeer will not feed and have nowhere to escape. Reindeer progressively reduce up to 7.5% of their daytime feeding until the number of skiers reaches 105. Above 105 skiers and as the number of skiers continues to increase, reindeer find refuge away from ski trails and their feeding time increases and returns to a zero percent reduction at 133 skiers or more. Long fright responses by reindeer towards snow-kiters and potentially very negative population consequences necessitate additional information on snow-kiting activities and appropriate management measures in reindeer habitats.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine the associations among work-family conflict (WFC), emotional exhaustion, musculoskeletal (MS) pain, and gastrointestinal problems on a sample of business travelers (n=2,093). An additional aim was to examine differences in the mentioned relationships among three traveler groups: commuters, national travelers, and international travelers. The study was conducted in a large Norwegian oil and gas company, and the company's business travel database was utilized to examine business travel. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed significant relations between WFC and emotional exhaustion and between emotional exhaustion and health problems. Contrary to the expectations, no direct association was found between WFC and health problems. However, we found that emotional exhaustion mediated the relation between WFC and health outcomes. The results from multi-group analysis revealed that associations among WFC, emotional exhaustion, and health-outcomes showed a similar pattern for commuters, national travelers, and international travelers. However, the association between emotional exhaustion and MS pain proved to be significantly stronger for the commuter group compared to the national and international travel groups. Practical implications and the consequences of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - A strict emission regime for marine operations in Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), increasing fuel prices and tax on environmental emissions, have led to a need to consider alternative solutions for Supplying power for offshore oil and gas installations. Conventionally, natural gas and diesel are used for the production of electricity on offshore installations. However, this conventional approach has developed into a real burden, as it conflicts with the aim of achieving least emission to the environment. Electrification has been considered as one of the alternatives to Cut down the emission level to a reasonable extent as well as to increase the power supply efficiency. This analysis deals with electrification of new facilities, while the cost of electrification of existing facilities has not been estimated yet. Although electrification might be selected as the best available technique for a given field, it is necessary to assure that the electrification technique will be fit for the purpose if it is going to be implemented in an unknown environment. This paper will address a method to qualify the electrification technique for a new oil field development on the NCS. Further, this study will help to confirm that the Best Available Technique (BAT) should be qualified prior to the implementation to avoid consequence of harm to the environment, society, health and finances.

AB  - 'Procedures for the Design of Roads in Harmony with Wildlife' or 'Harmony' is a project that aims to develop sustainable solutions to road transport challenges that are in harmony with wildlife. This paper summarises Harmony's work in the areas of Environmental Legislation and Guidelines, Project Appraisal, and Procurement Practices. The project mainly focuses on practices in the eight reference countries of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria, Sweden and Denmark.
   A review of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) is carried out. As part of this review, a database of over 80 Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and Appropriate Assessment reports is analysed to identify the similarities and differences between countries in the implementation of the duties required by EU Environmental Legislation. It is found that the degree of implementation under the headings considered varies greatly between countries. It is concluded that increased guidance on monitoring be provided in all countries.
   Project Appraisal for transport infrastructure is the process of assessing whether capital expenditure is justified for a project and ensuring that it is allocated to the best transport solution to achieve the objectives of that project whilst complying with planning policy and national and EU legislation. The project appraisal methodologies used in the reference countries are compared with the aim of identifying a set of tools to enable rational and sensible decisions to be made. The approach used in the UK is recommended for adoption by all Member States.
   This paper then examines existing approaches to the procurement of road constructions in the reference countries. The different types of contracts used for procurement are described and the benefits and disadvantages of different contract types are discussed. Recommendations are then made as to which contracts are the most favourable for ensuring the environmental commitments of the Environmental Impact Statement are carried out. Early contractor involvement as well as construction contracts that incorporate maintenance, with monitoring, for an extended period afterwards were cited as key recommendations to ensure a good outcome for wildlife.

AB  - Urban densification has for some decades been considered as the most relevant strategy for ecological modernization within the field of urban spatial development. Compared to outward urban expansion, densification has important environmental merits, but is not without negative environmental impacts. This paper critically examines how urban densification policies contain an assumption - implicit or explicit - that continual growth, expressed in per capita consumption of building stock and infrastructure, should be accommodated. This is argued to lead to a weakening of environmental sustainability. The Norwegian capital Oslo is used as an example, illustrating the environmental achievements and limitations of the densification strategy. These achievements and limitations are then discussed in the light of theoretical literature on tensions between economic growth and environmental sustainability. The paper concludes with a call for further critical scrutiny of how growth assumptions influence/subtly shape urban sustainability policies.

AB  - Brominated organic pollutants were found in selected samples of mollusk tissue, fish liver, as well as in the eggs and livers of shag from three sites in Central Norway. More than 80 organobromines were identified owing to the defined isotope ratio acquired by GC/ECNI-MS. However, only a few peaks could be assigned to anthropogenic brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Most of the organobromine compounds detected were unknown or halogenated natural products. The known halogenated natural products MHC-1 and TBA were abundant in all samples and usually between equally abundant, and up to 50 fold more concentrated than the major polybrominated diphenyl ether congener BDE 47. The halogenated natural products BC-2 (2-MeO-BDE 68) and BC-3 (6'-MeO-BDE 47), were on level with BDE 100 which was the second most abundant BDE congener in many samples. The previously identified natural polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivatives (PBHDs) were detected for the first time in bird eggs. Being major contaminants in bird eggs, PBHDs were only present at low levels in bird liver from nestlings originating from the same clutch. Such differences were detected for several other major contaminants. One unknown tetrabromo compound particularly abundant in mussels from Munkholmen was studied by GC/MS and the molecular ion was detected at m/z 446. The abundance of the most important unknown compounds did not correlate with BDEs and they most likely represent halogenated natural products. This study supports that halogenated natural products have to be treated as serious contaminants of marine coastal waters. Our data suggest that their abundance is highest in habitats along the shoreline. Thorough examination of these compounds in environmental samples is an important task. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The 1970s in Sweden saw a distinct change of attitude concerning color in architecture, from the use of strong primary colors, grey concrete and brick at the beginning of the decade to a lighter, more nuanced palette of pink and yellow toward the end of it. From being a significant token in a broader popular movement with commercial overtones, color, as the decade went on, increasingly demanded a stronger professional approach. The study addresses color in architecture as a cultural phenomenon, amenable to interpretation. In the analysis, color can consequently be used as a vehicle for understanding 1970s architecture within a social context.
   The debate on architecture in the 1970s was very much concerned with managing the legacy of discussions in previous decades. During the 1960s, good architecture in professional contexts had generally meant design adapted to modes of production, the handling of large volumes, additive vocabulary, and modular repetition. The reaction against this way of defining good architecture came out into the open during the 1970s. The focus on color in the 1970s, partly driven by the Anthroposophical society, helped to build a bridge and unleash a new discussion on how architecture and habitats should be designed in order to acquire significance in people's lives. The choices of colors underlining the expressions of structure, authenticity, and collective were gradually replaced by a striving for harmonic space, tradition, and individuality.

AB  - Energy strategies and decision-making studies rely heavily on a system of criteria and their weights of importance, typically determined through stakeholder involvement or surveys. However, the methodology presented in this study considers a reverse approach, as the importance weights are computed based on historical data of each European country's prevailing decisions on pre-defined aspects. An in-house-developed model was applied to analyze data from the ENTSO-E database for the determination of optimal criteria weights with combination of a linear programming task and Monte Carlo simulations. Applying the new model, the importance weights of seven selected criteria could be calculated for all European countries. The Eastern European region demonstrated exceptional sensitivity towards investment costs, while countries relying heavily on renewable or nuclear energy sources, such as Denmark, Greece, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, exhibited a dominant influence of environmental factors. Moreover, it was observed that the flexibility criterion aligned well with the installed generation capacities. However, the geopolitical factor and the risk of accidents criteria introduced nuances to the overall rating, indicating a somewhat reduced dependence on production data.

AB  - The safety perception of the built environment, rather than the sheer number of crimes and incivility behavior, is a fundamental driver of public policies intended to improve urban safety. Traditional surveys often capture neighborhood residents' perceived safety, but may not fully reflect the perceptions of people who are unfamiliar with the area. In this study, focused on the city of Stockholm, Sweden, we develop a geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) approach using street view images and recruiting locals to create a measure of citywide residents' safety perceptions. We compare the measures from the survey based on neighborhood residents' responses with those from the GeoAI approach to better understand the relationship between these safety measures. We model the two forms of safety perceptions and their disparities (i.e., perception bias) as a function of the city's land use and its socio-demographics. Results confirm that while the GeoAI-based measures better capture people's instant impressions of the built environment across the city, the survey-based measures reflect their overall daily experiences of specific areas. Regions that appear to be economically vibrant and have innercity streetscapes are perceived as safe places from visual appearance but are not always perceived as such by residents. Older adults tend to overestimate their likelihood of being victimized by crime, which may enlarge perception bias. The study concludes by critically assessing the potential ethical issues (e.g., spatial bias, population bias) in the proposed methodology and making suggestions for future research.

AB  - Determining forest fire history is commonly based on fire scar dating with dendrochronological methods. We used an experimental setup to investigate the impacts of low-intensity prescribed fire on fire scar formation 8 years after fire in 12 young managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Five stands were between 30 and 35 years old and seven were 45 years old at the time of burning. A total of 217 fire scars were recorded in 142 trees. The number of separate scars per tree originating from a single fire ranged from 1 to 6, with 67% of the trees having just one scar. The proportion of fire-scarred trees out of all trees per plot ranged from 0% to 30%, averaging 16.5% in young stands and 2.8% in older stands. Four of the 12 burned plots did not have any trees with fire scars, and these were all in the older age group. This means that in the older stands, in only three of seven plots (43%) did the fire leave scars from which fire can potentially be detected and dated afterwards. Our results suggest that fire scar dating in Scots pine dominated forests may underestimate fire frequency, area, and the importance of historically common low-intensity surface fires in dendrochronological reconstructions of past fire histories.

AB  - Studies of how proactive measures to reduce livestock depredation by carnivores affect human tolerance toward carnivores are extremely rare. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of money are spent each year on proactive measures to facilitate large carnivore conservation. The objective of this study was to assess how subsidies for proactive measures to reduce sheep losses to wolves are associated with public attitudes toward wolves. The respondents were 445 people living inside wolf territories in Sweden. Our data set is unique because we combine wolf territory level information regarding proactive subsidies and wolf attacks on dogs and sheep with geographical information of the respondents. Consequently, the respondents can be assigned to a specific wolf territory. The number of wolf attacks on sheep and dogs in the respective territories as well as the number of years that the wolf territory had existed did not affect human attitudes toward wolves. Subsidies for proactive measures to reduce wolf predation on sheep significantly increased positive attitudes toward wolf presence on the local scale. The magnitude of the effect of subsidies for proactive measures was comparable to the effect of other variables well known to affect human attitudes toward wolves such as age or education. Our data show that subsidies not only made the already positive more positive, but also made people with negative attitudes to wolf presence locally, less negative. Our conclusion is, therefore, that subsidies for proactive measures are an effective tool when working with "the human dimension" of conservation biology.

AB  - Role reversal can shift fish communities from predator to prey dominance. In the Baltic Sea, the increase in abundance of the small-bodied three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has co-occurred with declines of coastal predatory fish, such as perch (Percafluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) in many areas. Recent studies have pointed at predator-prey reversal as a possible mechanism explaining these trends, but conclusive evidence on the phenomenon or its relative importance compared to other drivers is at present open to question. In this study, we applied path analysis to quantify the potential role of stickleback in limiting the recruitment of perch and pike in enclosed bays (i.e. flads) along the Swedish and Finnish coasts. We constructed a causal network model based on vast field data combined with data from GIS and orthophotos, representing fish abundance, hydrographic factors, habitat-forming vegetation, anthropogenic disturbances and geomorphological factors. We found that stickleback abundance had as large effect on larval densities of perch and pike as environmental forcing, represented in our best models by the thermal regime of the flads. Larval densities decreased with stickleback abundance and increased with increasing summer cumulative temperature at a similar rate. Stickleback abundance, in turn, was strongly limited by flad openness, expressed as the number of flad openings to the sea, and increased with vascular plant cover (flad averages). Our study shows that predator-prey reversal could be a strong determinant of perch and pike larval survival, and suggests that the prevalence of more enclosed flads, which are less accessible to stickleback, may be crucial for recruitment of these piscivores. This implies that (1) in areas with, or prone to, increased stickleback abundance, habitat restoration and actions to conserve piscivore populations should primarily focus on more enclosed flads, and that (2) dredging and canalization to enhance boating in these areas could have detrimental effects on piscivore recruitment by decreasing water temperature and enhancing stickleback abundance, hence restricting larval growth and survival.

AB  - Society needs to find new ways to utilise its resources in the best possible way in order to enable satisfactory services for its citizens in the long term. This is particularly important in sparsely populated areas, and in cities and municipalities with a declining population. This study contributes to this field by analysing a project for collaboration between the rescue service and the home-care service that has been introduced in a number of Swedish municipalities. The collaboration is intended to ensure welfare and safety for citizens, to guarantee a more efficient use of municipal resources, and to contribute to improved emergency management and civil protection. The rescue service and the home-care service are two clearly gender-coded occupations that also operate on gender-coded workplaces and places of work. An overarching aim has therefore been to study gendered obstacles and possibilities of the collaboration. In our analysis of the empirical data - interviews with persons involved in the collaboration - place emerged as an important aspect of the collaboration processes, and is therefore elaborated in this article to contribute with knowledge of how conceptions and gender-coding of places and occupations affect sustainable and well-functioning collaboration processes. The results show that collaboration processes between municipal services are complex and challenge ideals of the organisation, content and responsibility of work and who should perform certain work tasks. Notions of gender and gender differences are reproduced through the collaboration, which affect the efforts of municipalities to ensure welfare and safety for citizens.

AB  - It is not until the fourteenth century that written records offer a glimpse into the coastal societies of Northern Sweden. Records include references to a social stratum referred to as the birkarlar, who were tradesmen engaged in trading with the Sami. The origin of the birkarlar, their prominent status and the meaning of the term, is an enigma that has been much disputed among scholars although there is consensus about the economic and fiscal supremacy of birkarlar vis-a-vis the Sami. However, the paradox of tradesmen employing force against their most important circle of suppliers and customers remains a puzzle. The birkarla institution is analyzed by means of alternative reading of historical records from the perspective of the indigenous Sami and coastal farming communities. The postulated animosity between Sami and the birkarlar is critically examined in light of the social and economic context of interior and coastal communities during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval period, and in relation to historically known Sami kinship relationships and marriage traditions. Data are analyzed with regard to demography and social structure, and from a landscape perspective including the logistics and practicalities of inter-cultural contact. Analyses corroborate that birkarlar were deeply rooted in the coastal communities and fully involved in the regular subsistence activities. They were representatives given a commission of trust and contacts between the birkarlar and the Sami were characterized by mutuality and inter-dependence.

AB  - This paper examines a struggle over the future use of Nordic forests, which took place from 2009 to 2012 within a major research program, Future Forests-Sustainable Strategies under Uncertainty and Risk, organized and funded by Mistra, The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research. We explore the role of strategic environmental research in societal constructions of long-term challenges and future risks. Specifically, we draw attention to the role played by environmental research in the creation of future images that become dominant for how societies structure action for the long term. We also show that this process is on several accounts problematic. Research labeled "strategic" or "relevant" is intended to manage long-term risks and challenges in a sustainable way, by taking into account the "open" and "plural" nature of the future. The case of Future Forests suggests, rather, that by contributing to the emergence of dominant future images, environmental research is entangled with a process of gradual consensus creation around what may be highly selective or biased narratives of the long term, which may conceal or postpone key forms of future conflict.

AB  - Coastal vegetation communities are important for primary production, biodiversity, coastal protection, carbon and nutrient cycling which, in combination with their sensitivity to eutrophication, render them potential indicators of environmental status for environmental policies like the EU Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. We evaluated one potential indicator for coastal vegetation, the cumulative cover at depths where the vegetation is light limited, by investigating its response to eutrophication along gradients in natural conditions. We used a large data set covering the Swedish coastline, spanning broad gradients in nutrient level, water clarity, sea-bed substrate, physical exposure and climate in addition to a salinity gradient from 0.5 to 30.5. Macroalgal cover increased significantly along gradients of declining nutrient concentration and increasing water clarity when we had accounted for diver effects, spatio-temporal sampling variability, salinity gradients, wave exposure and latitude. The developed empirical model explained 79% of the variation in algal cover across 130 areas. Based on this, we identified macroalgal cover as a promising indicator across the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak. A parallel analysis of soft-substrate macrophytes similarly identified significant increases in cover with decreasing concentrations of total nitrogen and increasing salinity, but the resulting empirical model explained only 52% of the variation in cover, probably due to the spatially more variable nature of soft-substrate vegetation. The identified general responses of vegetation cover to gradients of eutrophication across wide ranges in environmental settings may be useful for monitoring and management of marine vegetation in areas with strong environmental gradients.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to measure the gaps between the engagements of shippers (i.e. logistics buyers) and logistics service providers (LSPs) in different green logistics practices (GLPs) throughout the key phases of the logistics purchasing process: request for proposal, negotiations, contracting and execution. Design/methodology/approach A large-scale survey of shippers and LSPs in Sweden was conducted. Respondents were 331 firms (169 shippers, 162 LSPs). Mean values of the actors' perceptions were analysed using independent- and paired samplet-tests. Findings While this study supports previous research indicating that LSPs engage more extensively in selling GLPs than shippers do in buying them, it shows that this conclusion does not uniformly apply to all GLPs nor all purchasing phases. Three patterns emerged for the gaps between the actors' buying-selling engagements throughout the purchasing process: (1) steady and wide gaps, (2) steady and narrow gaps and (3) emergent gaps. Distinct GLPs were associated with each pattern. It is also shown that the prioritisation of GLPs is fairly aligned between shippers and LSPs. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the green logistics purchasing literature by systematically and simultaneously creating three types of distinction, between (1) shippers and LSPs, (2) different GLPs and (3) different logistics purchasing phases. Future studies could replicate the analysis in countries other than Sweden. Practical implications Managers of shipper/LSP firms learn tips to spot the GLPs that their partners prioritise, enabling them to modify their purchasing/marketing strategies accordingly. Originality/value The three types of distinction represent a novel approach in the green logistics purchasing literature.

AB  - Digitalisation of the process and energy industries through energy digital twin technology promises stepimprovements in energy management and optimisation, better servicing and maintenance, energy-efficient design and evolution of existing sites, and integration with locally and regionally generated renewable energy. This systematic and critical review aims to accelerate the understanding, classification, and application of energy digital twin technology. It adds to the literature by developing an original multi-dimensional digital twin classification framework, summarising the applications of energy digital twins throughout a site's lifecycle, and constructing a proposal of how to apply the technology to industrial sites and local areas to enable a reduction in carbon and other environmental footprints. The review concludes by identifying key challenges that face uptake of energy digital twins and a framework to apply the energy digital twins.

AB  - A widespread decline in biodiversity in agro-ecosystems has been reported for several groups of organisms in Western Europe. The butterfly fauna was studied in 60 selected semi-natural grasslands in a coniferous-dominated boreal landscape in south-eastern Sweden. The aim was to investigate how butterfly assemblages were affected by the amount of semi-natural grasslands in the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if semi-natural grasslands in boreal landscapes harboured species otherwise declining in other parts of Europe. For each study site, the amounts of semi-natural grasslands in the landscape within radii of 500, 2,000 and 5,000 m were studied. Nine local habitat factors were also recorded. Only the amount of semi-natural grasslands within a 5,000 m radius could explain a significant part of the variation in butterfly composition, but there was no clear relationship between the amount of semi-natural grassland and butterfly diversity. Instead, this study showed that local habitat quality was very important for butterfly diversity at individual sites. Flower abundance, sward height and herb composition were the most important local factors. Patches surrounded by a small amount of semi-natural grasslands had high butterfly diversity, contrary to expectations. This may be explained by the fact that forest habitat provides a matrix with several features suitable for butterflies. The butterfly fauna was rich in species representative of low-productivity grasslands, species that are declining in other countries in Western Europe.

AB  - Background National food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) are generally designed from a human health perspective and often disregard sustainability aspects. Circular food production systems are a promising solution to achieve sustainable healthy diets. In such systems, dosing nutrient cycles where possible and minimising external inputs contribute to reducing environmental impacts. This change could be made by limiting livestock feed to available lowopportunity-cost biomass (LOCB). We examined the compatibility of national dietary guidelines for animal products with livestock production on the basis of the feed supplied by available LOCB.
   Methods We investigated whether the national dietary recommendations for animal products for Bulgaria, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland could be met with domestically available LOCB. We used an optimisation model that allocates feed resources to different species of farm animals. Of the resulting scenarios, we assessed the nutritional feasibility, climate impact, and land use.
   Findings Our results showed the environmental benefits of reducing the recommended animal products in the FBDGs, and that animal products from LOCB could provide between 22% (Netherlands) and 47% (Switzerland) of total protein contributions of the FBDGs. This range covers a substantial part of the nutritional needs of the studied populations. To fully meet these needs, consumption of plant-based food could be increased.
   Interpretation Our results contribute to the discussion of what quantities of animal products in dietary guidelines are compatible with circular food systems. Thus, national dietary recommendations for animal products should be revised and recommended quantities lowered. This finding is consistent with recent efforts to include sustainability criteria in dietary guidelines. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Impacts of salmon lice is a major concern for a sustainable production of farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. Most treatment methods for removal of salmon lice have associated increased mortality and decreased growth in a period after delousing, which affects the profitability of the farmer, and causes poor welfare and sustainability. In addition, the variance in mortality and growth, especially after non-medicinal treatment methods, is high, which makes it hard for a farmer to decide which control measure to apply to keep lice levels below the legal limit. In this study, we have applied a stochastic partial budget approach to assess the economic impact of reducing mortality and increasing growth of farmed Atlantic salmon by preventing, replacing and improving current delousing methods in Norway. We have simulated a production cycle of two different smolt-groups to find the outcome (harvested biomass, average end weight of the salmon, number of dead fish and feed consumption) of production cycles without or with two, three or four delousing treatments in the on-growing phase at sea. The results suggest that accounting for the biological losses associated with lice treatments is important when making choices of delousing strategies. The biological costs of increased mortality and decreased growth associated with especially non-medicinal treatments are expected to be high, but varies substantially. Therefore, the economic benefit of preventing or improving can also be high. The calculations imply that salmon producers could invest a considerable amount in measures for prevention or improvement of thermal treatments before break-even. For example could a farmer use on average 535,313 euro/cage/ 1-yearling production in measure to prevent four thermal treatments before it is no longer economical beneficial. Depending on the performance of the four thermal treatments a farmer could use from 319,196-737,934 euro/cage/ 1-yearling production on measures of improvement. Replacing one thermal treatment with another immediate treatment method has a minor eco-nomic benefit. The results further shows that sales value and feed consumption constitutes the largest share of the change in profit between different treatment regimes. The results from this study also show that not taking into account the risk of mortality and reduced growth associated with the different treatment methods of delousing, could lead to underestimating the benefit of improving, preventing and replacing treatments.

AB  - Occupational therapists and occupational scientists are increasingly aware of the relationship between occupation and global climate change, with some working to raise awareness of the issues and others proposing that an occupational perspective can make a valuable contribution to understanding and addressing the issues. In this discussion paper the United Nations Global Survey on Sustainable Lifestyles (1), which reports young adults' beliefs about everyday occupations that have a substantial impact on the environment (food, housekeeping, and transportation) is introduced. The authors argue that the survey findings are a valuable resource for occupational therapists who are concerned about global climate change and work with young adults (age 18-35), providing valuable insights into their concerns and preferences in relation to sustainability. To illustrate the insights contained in the reports, findings from four countries are presented: New Zealand and Sweden, the authors' countries of origin, and the Philippines and Lebanon which have people living in New Zealand and Sweden. Application to individual and community-based interventions to promote more sustainable lifestyles is suggested, along with studies to examine the perspectives of young adults with a disability, as their concerns and sustainability preferences might differ due to the barriers that limit their participation in educational and vocational occupations.

AB  - QuestionsIs there a shift from positive to negative biotic interaction effects on seedling recruitment along two different stress gradients, temperature and precipitation (the stress-gradient hypothesis); do such interaction effects differ between species with different bioclimatic affinities?
   LocationBoreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland in southern Norway.
   MethodsWe tested the stress-gradient hypothesis by comparing seedling recruitment in bare-ground gaps where vegetation has been removed vs in extant grassland vegetation in 12 boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland sites along a precipitation gradient. This was tested in (1) a seed-sowing experiment and (2) in naturally occurring recruitment of alpine, generalist and boreal species.
   ResultsEmergence of the sown alpine species was higher in the cold alpine than in the warmer sub-alpine sites, with no effects of precipitation or vegetation removal. The sown generalists also decreased in emergence towards warmer sites, whereas there was no effect of temperature on the sown boreal species. Vegetation removal, interacting with precipitation, increased the emergence of the generalist and boreal species sown at intermediate precipitation levels. In contrast, interactions between temperature and vegetation removal regulated the emergence of all groups of naturally occurring seedlings. Alpine and generalist species emerged at the highest rate in alpine sites, whereas boreal species had highest emergence in the lowlands.
   ConclusionFor all species groups, strong effects of vegetation removal show that competition from the extant vegetation dominates in controlling seedling emergence across all study sites and species. In generalist and boreal species, positive interactions between vegetation removal and temperature show that competitive interactions affect seedling emergence more strongly towards warmer climates, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis. In contrast, alpine species show no such interactions. This suggests that species' adaptations to climate, in combination with environmental forcing, control seedling emergence along the bioclimatic gradients. Our results have implications for nature conservation, as we propose that disturbance from grazing animals can be useful to release competition and thereby increase seedling recruitment and biodiversity in boreal and alpine grasslands in a warmer future.

AB  - To maintain biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands, the choice of breed of livestock and season of grazing can be important. The objective was to determine the effects of breed and season on the composition of plant fragments in the faeces of cattle grazing a heterogeneous semi-natural grassland. Twelve heifers of the traditional Swedish Vaneko breed (live weight 309 kg) and twelve heifers of the Charolais breed (live weight 431 kg) were allocated to three pastures per breed. Faeces samples were collected in spring, summer and autumn for micro-histological examination of plant fragments. On the same occasion, defoliation of four competitive plant species was recorded. Faecal plant fragments mainly consisted of grasses but also herbs, whereas Cyperaceae, despite their abundance on the pastures, only composed a small proportion of fragments. Season affected the composition of plant fragments in the faeces, with a higher proportion of Cyperaceae and herbs in spring than later in the grazing period (P < 0.001), and the heifers ingesting more grasses and woody plants in autumn. In spite of a clear difference in live weight between the two breeds, no effects of breed on the composition of plant fragments in faeces were observed, although Vaneko heifers defoliated more Filipendula ulmaria in spring than the Charolais heifers (P < 0.01). In addition, defoliation of Alnus glutinosa increased later in the grazing period (P < 0.05), especially for the Vaneko heifers, indicating control of pernicious brushwood by grazing may be more effective in autumn.

AB  - In an attempt to quantitatively evaluate the natural versus anthropogenic signal in site fire histories, the statistical relationship between dendrochronologically dated fire events and tree-ring chronologies (deemed to be an independent proxy for climate variation) was analyzed for 14 sites in a 2600-km(2) area of pine-dominated forests in the Komi Republic (East European Russia) over the period from 1424 to 1954. We developed a cumulative measure of statistical fit between two types of fire events (early- and late-season fires) and ring-width chronologies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (total ring- and latewood-width chronologies). For a given site, the statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data tended to decrease with an increasing proportion of unique fire years. Distance from a site to the nearest village (deemed to be a proxy of human impact) explained 50% of the variation in statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data. The fit decreased in the majority of the sites from the earlier (1424-1700) to the later (1700-1960) periods. We interpret this to be a result of increased human impact on the fire regime since 1700 due to intensified colonization of the area.

AB  - The author argues that the latest elections to the European Parliament (EP) became a landmark event in the party-political landscape of the Old World. The elections confirmed the trend emerged in the beginning of the XXI century: nationalist parties almost everywhere strengthened their electoral positions. In Austria, Italy and Finland they gained solid experience of coalition work. In the Netherlands and Belgium nationalist parties managed to enter local government. To a big extent, nationalists influenced the governments in Denmark, Sweden, and, more recently, in Spain. Nationalists became active in Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary). Their primary political interest is focused on the European Union reforms, the migration issue, the social processes in the EU, relations between Europe and the United States, China, and Russia. After the European elections in May, 2019, they created the large "Identity and Democracy" group within the European parliament. The article examines conflicting trends in the nationalist camp, the development of both centripetal and centrifugal tendencies. It is possible to assess the current situation only by considering objective and subjective factors typical both for individual countries, regions of Europe, and for the continent as a whole.

AB  - Mercury is a toxic and hazardous metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust. Natural phenomena such as erosion and volcanic eruptions, and anthropogenic activities like metal smelting and industrial production and use may lead to substantial contamination of the environment with mercury. Through consumption of mercury in food, the populations of many areas, particularly in the developing world, have been confronted with catastrophic outbreaks of mercury-induced diseases and mortality. Countries such as Japan, Iraq, Ghana, the Seychelles, and the Faroe Islands have faced such epidemics, which have unraveled the insidious and debilitating nature of mercury poisoning. Its creeping neurotoxicity is highly devastating, particularly in the central and peripheral nervous systems of children. Central nervous system defects and erethism as well as arrythmias, cardiomyopathies, and kidney damage have been associated with mercury exposure. Necrotizing bronchitis and pneumonitis arising from inhalation of mercury vapor can result in respiratory failure. Mercury is also considered a potent immunostimulant and -suppressant, depending on exposure dose and individual susceptibility, producing a number of pathologic sequelae including lymphoproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and total systemic hyper- and hyporeactivities. In this review we discuss the sources of mercury and the potential for human exposure; its biogeochemical cycling in the environment; its systemic, immunotoxic, genotoxic/carcinogenic, and teratogenic health effects; and the dietary influences on its toxicity; as well as the important considerations in risk assessment and management of mercury poisoning.

AB  - We have quantified floristic changes in alpine snowbeds and wetland vegetation during three decades and analyzed to what extent these changes are related to initial variations in snow cover duration and distance to groundwater level. Vascular plant species richness and total plant cover were estimated along three transects in northern Norway. Three different vegetation zones were identified along the original transects: relatively dry snowbeds, wet snowbeds and wetlands. The resampling shows major changes in species richness and plant cover. In general, there was a net immigration of species and 13 new species were found. Five rare species with initial low cover were lost. In the dry and wet snowbeds, species richness and total plant cover increased, mostly because of invasion by shrubs, graminoids and herbs. A general trend was that species indicating high soil moisture were strongly reduced. In the wetland zones there were no significant floristic changes but hygrophilous species had decreased and were replaced by graminoids and shrub species with lower water requirements. These floristic changes were significantly related to snow and soil moisture conditions, important factors for rate and direction of change. Contrasting vegetation responses within very short distances demonstrate the importance of detailed knowledge of the actual microhabitats when effects of climate change in alpine habitats are considered.

AB  - High elevation sites in the low mountain ranges in Germany are naturally covered by Norway spruce (Picea abies (Karst.) L.) stands. Historically, large scale anthropogenic range expansion starting in the mid to late 18th century had a huge impact on the forest composition throughout Germany. Utilisation and exploitation often led to artificial regeneration, mostly carried out using seeds from allochthonous provenances. Usually, autochthonous (natural) high elevation Norway spruce trees have narrow crown phenotypes, whereas lowland trees have broader crowns. Narrow crown phenotypes are likely the result of adaptation to heavy snow loads combined with high wind speeds. In the present study, neighbouring stand pairs of putative autochthonous and allochthonous origin with contrasting phenotypes in high elevation sites were investigated with 200 samples each. These stands are located in the Ore Mountains, the Thuringian Forest, and the Harz Mountains. Additionally, a relict population with the typical narrow high elevation phenotypes was sampled in Thuringia, known as Schlossbergfichte. The objective of the study was to quantify supposedly adaptive phenotypic differences in crown architecture and the genetic differentiation of 11 putatively neutral nuclear microsatellite markers (i.e., simple sequence repeats (nSSRs)). The high differentiation of morphological traits (P-ST = 0.952-0.989) between the neighbouring autochthonous and allochthonous stands of similar age contrasts with the very low neutral genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.002-0.007; G(ST) = 0.002-0.030), suggesting that directional selection at adaptive gene loci was involved in phenotypic differentiation. Comparing the regions, a small isolation by distance effect for the Harz Mountains was detected, suggesting landscape resistance restricting gene flow. Finally, the differentiation of the very old autochthonous (up to 250 years) stand Schlossbergfichte with typical high elevation phenotypes could cohere with the sampling of a relict genepool.

AB  - 1. Environmental DNA (eDNA) from water samples is increasingly used to detect the presence and distribution of species in aquatic ecosystems. However, before implementing eDNA in monitoring programmes, various species-specific sampling or analytical issues remain to be resolved in order to minimize frequencies of false-positive and -negative results. For example, empty shells from freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera) contain extractable DNA (chemical extraction from ground-up shells) suggesting a risk of false-positive samples at stream sites with extinct populations but with empty shell material remaining.
   2. The aim of this study was to investigate whether empty and naturally degrading shells from M. margaritifera can cause false-positive eDNA signals in water samples.
   3. Water samples were collected from outdoor stream channels (in Lemming, Denmark) with living freshwater pearl mussels or empty shell material (density similar to 10 individuals m(-2)) during a 3-week experimental period. Living freshwater pearl mussels were collected from Hemgravs stream in Sweden and transported to Denmark according to permissions granted by the Swedish and Danish authorities.
   4. All water samples from stream channels containing empty shells were negative for eDNA indicating that eDNA traces in stream water are most likely to originate from living individuals located upstream of the sampling site. Water samples collected from stream channels containing living individuals of M. margaritifera were consistently positive for eDNA except for one sample (interpreted as a false negative).
   5. The study shows that positive eDNA signals for freshwater pearl mussels most likely reflect the presence of living individuals. Consequently, we suggest that eDNA should be used to locate remaining population fragments of M. margaritifera in deep and turbulent streams, providing a platform for faster and more efficient decision making when launching investigative and mitigation initiatives.

AB  - This paper presents a case study about the MOOC or Massive Open Online Course: "Madrid, History, Architecture and Urban Planning: a Smart and Sustainable City?", which has been included and financed as a Research Project of Innovative Methodologies by "Universidad Politecnica de Madrid", the Polytechnic University of Madrid in Spain.
   What might be new in Spain could be not considered so in other countries and there is already some years of experience in this kind of online technologies being used. A MOOC allow you to learn about a very specific subject area. Taught by prestigious universities and large companies, MOOC courses make it possible to combine study with other activities since its flexible hours, its organization and its price make this training very attractive. When our university included in 2016 MOOC courses in its innovation policies, we decided to be part of it.
   But many issues are related to teaching to such large audiences, for which MOOCs are designed. Some of them are explained through this paper, as these courses are very different from other online courses for a reduced number of students, as written by experts and also, as found by the team which designed it.
   We present here an experience of how to introduce the students to the knowledge of the city. Knowing it, they will be able to learn architecture, urbanism, and to relate to their environment. The provisional results have been very satisfactory with 429 students enrolled in the First Session, and the Second one, that will finish before the end of the year 2017. The students are from 37 countries, some of them located very far from Spain, such as: Egypt, Peru, United States, Brazil, India, Sweden, Japan...The design of their cities is very different as well as their culture or academic systems. We explain what we have found.

AB  - Development of environmentally and economically sound agricultural production systems is an important aim in agricultural policy and has a high priority in agricultural research worldwide. The present work uses results from the first complete crop rotation period (1990-1997) of the Apelsvoll cropping system experiment in south-eastern Norway to discuss the effect of cropping systems and their management practices on environment, soil fertility, crop yields and the farm economy, and how this knowledge may be used to develop a more sustainable agriculture. The experiment includes conventional arable (CON-A), integrated arable (INT-A), ecological arable (ECO-A), conventional forage (CON-F), integrated forage (INT-F) and ecological forage (ECO-F) cropping systems which were established on model farms of 0.2 ha. On the basis of nutrient runoff, soil erosion and pesticide contamination, the following ranking from the most to the least favourable was made for environmental effects: INT-F > ECO-F > ECO-A > INT-A > CON-F > CON-A. Environmental effects such as N and P runoff losses were very much linked to the proportion of ley in the system. Thus, major improvements to reduce the effects of agriculture on nutrient runoff, cannot be achieved without changing the cropping systems in the direction of more mixed fanning with reduced cropping intensity. The nutrient balance calculations showed that there were considerable deficits in the ecological systems, a fact which must be taken into consideration in the development of sustainable ecological cropping systems. The yield reduction experienced with integrated and ecological cropping, relative to conventional cropping, was smaller for forage crops and potatoes than for cereals. This suggests that it is easier to maintain the yield level by reduced cropping intensity in mixed farming systems with livestock than in arable fanning systems without livestock. Because of the premium prices and government subsidies to ecological fanning, the economic results were equally good in the ecological systems as in the conventional ones. Economically, integrated farming was less favourable than the other systems. It is concluded that, overall, integrated and ecological forage systems results in the least environmental harm, and based upon the present government subsidies, the forage systems also seem the most profitable, along with the ecological arable system.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) tend to target shallow waters, but the depth distributions of coastal fish can vary depending on species, size, and sex. This creates a scope for a form of fishing selectivity that has received limited attention but can have considerable implications for monitoring and management of these fisheries. We conducted a case study on the Norwegian wrasse fishery, a developing SSF in which multiple species are caught in shallow waters (mean depth = 4.5 m) to be used as cleaner fish in aquaculture. Several of these wrasses have life histories and behaviors that are sensitive to selective fishing mortality, such as sexual size dimorphism, paternal care, and sex change. An experimental fishery was undertaken over three sampling periods in 2018. Data on catch, length, and sex of wrasses across a depth gradient (0-18 m) were collected and analyzed. We found that depth distributions were species specific and the vertical overlap with the fishery was high for Corkwing Wrasse Symphodus melops and Ballan Wrasse Labrus bergylta, which were most abundant at depths less than 5 m. Three other wrasse species had invariant or increasing abundance with depth and were therefore less likely to be negatively impacted by this fishery. Body size was positively correlated with depth for these wrasses, and sex ratio became more male biased for the Corkwing Wrasse, the only species that could be visually sexed. This study demonstrates that depth can have strong effects on fishing selectivity at multiple scales and that such knowledge is necessary to develop management strategies that balance fishing mortality sustainably across species, sizes, and sexes. We recommend that management priorities be directed toward the Ballan and Corkwing wrasses-the species having the highest vertical overlap with the fishery. Furthermore, CPUE was strongly affected by seasonality and positively correlated with increasing wave exposure for one of the species. This underscores the general importance of standardizing catch data for several environmental covariates when monitoring species that are affected by SSFs.

AB  - 1. Studies on biodiversity patterns should optimally relate different scales of temporal community variability to spatial variability. Although temporal biodiversity variability is often negligible compared to spatial variation, it may still constitute a substantial source of overall community variability in stream ecosystems. Boreal streams exhibit seasonally recurring environmental periodicity, which can be expected to induce synchronous dynamics of abiotic variables among sites, and consequently, to produce spatial synchrony of deterministically controlled biological communities with higher intra- than inter-annual community variability.
   2. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in 10 near-pristine boreal streams on three different seasons (spring, summer, autumn) across 4 consecutive years in northern Finland. We aimed to identify the relative contributions of spatial, inter-annual, and seasonal variability to overall benthic biodiversity; and relate variation in benthic invertebrate communities to key environmental factors, particularly in-stream habitat diversity.
   3. Among-site spatial variability was clearly the most important source of variation for both species richness and community dissimilarity. Of the two temporal scales, inter-annual variability contributed more to variation in taxonomic richness and seasonal variability slightly more to variability in community composition.
   4. Only inter-annual variation differed systematically from random expectation, indicating strong stability (low variability) of stream macroinvertebrate communities across years, with less variation at sites with higher substrate heterogeneity. Considering the distinct seasonality of the boreal stream environment, seasonal variability accounted for an unexpectedly low amount of total community variability.
   5. Although differences between seasons were small, autumnal sampling is likely to be the least susceptible to climatic vagaries, thus providing the most consistent and predictable conditions for benthic sampling in boreal streams, particularly for bioassessment purposes. Exceptional climatic conditions are becoming more frequent in northern Europe, probably causing substantial and largely unpredictable changes in benthic community composition. As a result, the importance of temporal (relative to spatial) community variability may increase.

AB  - Since the substantial loss of subtidal eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in the 1930s, seagrass beds in the Wadden Sea are limited to the intertidal zone and dominated by Z. noltii Hornem. This study deals with the effect of vegetated tidal flats on quantities of mobile epifauna and proves empirically the function of seagrass canopies as a refuge for marine animals remaining in the intertidal zone at ebb tide. Drop-trap samples were taken in the Sylt-Romo Bight, a shallow tidal basin in the northern Wadden Sea, on vegetated and unvegetated tidal flats during July and August 2002, and during the entire growth period of Z. noltii from May to September in 2003. The species composition in Z. noltii and bare sand flats showed minor differences since only two isopod species (Idotea baltica and I. chelipes) occurred on Z. noltii flats exclusively. Juvenile shore crabs (Carcinus maenas L.), brown shrimps (Crangon crangon L.) and common gobies (Pomatoschistus microps Kroyer) were also found abundantly on bare sand flats. However, the results showed significantly higher abundances and production of these dominant species on vegetated tidal flats. Additionally, the analyses of faunal size classes indicated higher percentages of small individuals in the seagrass bed during the entire sampling period. Despite drastic diurnal fluctuations of dissolved oxygen at low tide, faunal density in the residual water layer remaining in seagrass canopies at ebb tide was found to be consistently higher than that found in artificially created tide-pool units. Although species composition of mobile epifauna did not basically differ between vegetated and unvegetated tidal flats, Z. noltii beds are considered to contribute quantitatively to the function of tidal flats, as an extended juvenile habitat for some of the most important species of the Wadden Sea food web.

AB  - This study aims to gain a greater insight into cycling as an element of mobility among those in later life. The characteristics and views of those who cycle, those who have never cycled, as well as those who have discontinued cycling in later life are the main focus. Malmo, a city in the south of Sweden with a strong emphasis on bicycle planning, is the study area. This study employed a mixed methods approach. The quantitative element comprised a survey which aimed to capture the trends at play when it comes to cycling within this age group. The qualitative element encompassed two focus groups which were carried out in order to gain a deeper insight into older persons' perspectives and perceptions with respect to cycling. The study's findings illustrate the very positive and important role cycling can play in the mobility of older persons in the city of Malmo. It is not only possible but also mostly enjoyable for many older people to cycle. Cycling is a facilitator of activities and is largely associated with convenience and ease. There are clear differences between cyclists and non-cyclists, with the former generally having a wider range of mobility opportunities available to them. Cycling cessation is anticipated as a very distressing, yet inevitable, life event by those who still cycle. The results of this study suggest that campaigns aimed at increasing the awareness and consideration of other road users towards older cyclists, as well as the introduction of clearer and more visible signage could support older cyclists in prolonging their cycling, as well as improving the experience they have as they do cycle. Increasing awareness of the health benefits of cycling could be another means of encouraging people to continue cycling as they age. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and explore important quality-related challenges facing organizations, and investigate how current excellence models incorporate these challenges.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a Delphi study of Swedish organizations. Forty-nine challenges were generated and ranked according to importance and the ten top-ranked challenges were compared to the principles of four excellence models.
   Findings - The excellence models still seem to be relevant since their content matches many of the identified challenges. The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and the Swedish Institute for Quality models were found to have the most comprehensive coverage, while the International Organization for Standardization model had limited coverage.
   Research limitations/implications - Three areas for further research were identified: first, how quality management (QM) can evolve in different contexts that have varying needs in terms of adaptive and explorative capabilities; second, the interfaces of QM and sustainability, and ways to understand how customers and stakeholders can be active contributors to improvements; and third, the roles of the owners and board of directors regarding QM, and how to organize and distribute responsibilities of the QM work.
   Practical implications - There are three important challenges that future revisions of excellence models could address: first, making QM a strategic issue for company owners; second, involving customers in the improvement activities; and third, developing processes that are robust yet still easily adaptable.
   Originality/value - The Delphi study identified upcoming challenges in the QM area based on input from 188 quality professionals.

AB  - Large areas of farmland are abandoned in Norway, which for various reasons are regarded as undesirable. Loss of farmland may have negative implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function and food production potential. The objectives of this study were to assess forage mass production and utilization, botanical composition, lamb performance, and grazing distribution pattern when reintroducing livestock grazing to an abandoned grassland. The study area was located in Central Norway, unmanaged for 12 years. Sheep grazed the area for 10 weeks in 2013 and 4 weeks in spring and autumn, respectively, in 2014 and 2015. During the summer of 2014 and 2015, the area was subjected to the following replicated treatments: (1) No grazing, (2) grazing with heifers, and (3) grazing with ewes and their offspring. The stocking rate was similar in the grazed treatments. Forage biomass production and animal intake were estimated using grazing exclosure cages and botanical composition by visual assessment. Effect on lamb performance was evaluated by live weight gain and slaughter traits in sheep subjected to three treatments: (1) Common farm procedure with summer range pasturing, (2) spring grazing period extended by 1 month on the abandoned grassland before summer range pasturing, and (3) spring and summer grazing on the abandoned grassland. Grazing distribution patterns were studied using GPS position collars on ewes. Total annual biomass production was on average 72% higher with summer grazing than without. Annual consumption and utilization was on average 218 g DM/m(2) and 70% when summer grazed, and 25g DM/m(2) and 18% without grazing, respectively. Botanical composition did not differ between treatments. Live weight gain was higher in lambs subjected to an extended spring grazing period (255 g/d) compared to common farm practice (228 g/d) and spring and summer grazing on the abandoned grassland (203 g/d), and carcass value was 14% higher in lambs on extended spring grazing compared to common farm practice. In autumn, sheep preferred to graze areas grazed by sheep during summer. Re-introduction of grazing stimulated forage production, and extended spring grazing improved performance in lambs. This study has quantified the value of abandoned grassland as a feed resource.

AB  - To preserve biodiversity in managed forest landscapes dead and living trees are retained at final cuttings. In the present study we evaluated the effect of these practices for saproxylic (wood-dependent) beetles inhabiting dead aspen trees (Populus tremulae). For saproxylic beetles, tree retention at final cuttings can be expected to be especially valuable for species adapted to sun-exposed dead wood, a substrate that only rarely occurs in well managed forest stands. Therefore, the current evaluation was conducted as a comparison of species richness, species density (number of species per sample), assemblage composition and occurrence of individual species between clear-cuts, where aspen trees were retained, and closed forest stands with aspen trees. The study was conducted in central Sweden and the beetles were sampled by sieving of bark from CWD (coarse woody debris) of aspen. There was no significant difference in rarefied species richness between forest and clear-cut sites. Species composition differed significantly between the two stand types. Generalized linear mixed-effects models predicted the species density to be 34% lower in CWD objects in forest sites than on clear-cuts. This pattern could partly be explained by differences in CWD diameter, decay class and bark types between the two stand types (clear-cut/forest). Stand type was a significant predictor of occurrence in individual CWD objects for 30% of analysed individual beetle species. For all species except one, the variable stand type predicted higher occurrence on clear-cuts than in forest stands. To conclude, our results demonstrate that retention of aspen on clear-cuts contributes to population recruitment of a different assemblage of species than CWD within stands. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rocky shores are rare in the fossil record due to erosion under both sea-level rise and fall. In contrast, modern rocky shores are well-studied, but little is known about the evolution of their ecosystems due to the rarity of ancient counterparts. Reconstruction of these ancient ecosystems is thus essential to get an insight into their evolution. A high-diversity Late Cretaceous (Campanian) rocky shore fauna is found in southern Sweden. The original composition of the shelly fauna cannot be interpreted by direct examination of the preserved fauna due to the effects of taphonomic processes. Life and death assemblages from a modern rocky shore fauna from Thailand have previously been analysed and a hypothetical fossil assemblage was reconstructed in order to attempt an interpretation of the Campanian life assemblage. This study shows a low taxonomic agreement between the original Campanian life assemblage and the fossil assemblage, due to taphonomic processes, and high environmental fidelity with only a few out-of-habitat species represented. The modern life assemblage showed in an earlier study, a high loss of species before onset of fossilisation. This suggests that the faunal composition of the Campanian life assemblage cannot be easily reconstructed, and time averaging by generations of death assemblages makes this even more difficult. The Campanian aragonitic fauna is poorly represented and the rarity of moulds after aragonitic species is interpreted as due to taphonomic processes and not to lower richness of aragonitic species in the Cretaceous. This is supported by comparison with the high richness of aragonitic species found on a Late Cretaceous rocky shore in Germany. An originally high-diversity gastropod fauna is thus interpreted to have dominated the intertidal zone in the Campanian example, and the rare moulds of each of the aragonitic species indicate a high taphonomic loss in spite of rapid burial. Calcitic species-richness is higher in the Campanian fauna than in the modern life, death, and constructed hypothetical fossil assemblages. This is interpreted as reflecting time averaging of generations of calcitic species and low loss of calcitic species by taphonomic processes in the Campanian fauna. It is thus assumed that the original Campanian fauna experienced a change in faunal composition from a gastropod-dominated life assemblage to a bivalve-dominated fossil assemblage due to dissolution of aragonite and excellent preservation of calcite. Reconstruction of ancient rocky shore shelly faunas can thus be considerably improved by comparison with analogous modem rocky shore faunas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research presents a decision support method for housing managers to identify the most appropriate renovation strategy, which combines a multi-criteria assessment of ten renovation factors together with an economic feasibility analysis. In contrast to the majority of decision support systems, this method not only assesses the impact of the renovation proposals, but also includes and evaluates the management of the renovation process through a procedure of quantifying and weighting multiple social, technical, and economic variables related to the renovation work. The method, based on two representative cases of housing renovation projects in Sweden, has been designed and tested and is also applicable to other locations, multi-family buildings, and ownership models. Via a graphical display, the results show the impact generated during the work, the benefits obtained after the interventions, and the economic feasibility in different timeframes of each design strategy, which supports housing owners' decision-making and promotes feasible and suitable actions from a multidisciplinary approach. The conclusions highlight the possibility of implementing renovation strategies at various levels and provide policy implications of this method for a cleaner operation in the building sector with responsible management of urban regeneration by generating sustainable renovation rates and satisfactory proposals.

AB  - While central and northern European land-mollusc forest communities have received considerable research effort, southern Europe has enjoyed much less attention. Despite the extent of Italian forests in terms of altitude and latitude, there has been only one previous quantitative study of their molluscan faunas. This paper describes the molluscan communities of six forest habitats in northern Italy along an altitudinal transect. Species richness had its highest values at low elevations, especially in maritime woodland and in riverine poplar woodland. Species abundance decreased from lowland to montane habitats, possibly as a consequence of a transition from eutrophic to oligotrophic habitats and from calcareous to acidic soils. Compared with the central and northern European forests, the Italian forests were poorer as far as species richness is concerned, but showed greater diversity among locations as the Jaccard presence/absence similarity index among habitats is equal or lower than 0.5. Considering abundances, all molluscan communities were significantly different in pairwise comparisons, with the single exception of the montane mixed-deciduous and beech forests. The low faunal similarity among sites and the high percentage of species found in only one habitat support the need for a network of diverse protected areas to preserve land-mollusc biodiversity.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) strategies are central in solving the waste management challenges of today, yet the global nature of the waste trade results in emissions and the export of negative environmental externalities to low-income countries. Here, we target a systemic challenge in the current indicators developed to measure more sustainable consumption and production progress. We argue that sustainable, circular solutions to recycling need to account for the negative externalities caused by the physical distance of the waste trade. We define the new concept "Small Circles" (SC) and suggest a new circularity indicator that can better ensure sustainability in implementing closed-loop strategies and thereby provide critical criteria to consider in pursuing CE. The SC approach advocates the need to manage the waste within a smaller geographical area of its origin to reduce the environmental burdens originating from the transboundary export of waste. Further, it ensures that the waste-producing regions take responsibility for their waste generation and management. If implemented appropriately, we argue that the SC approach could improve the transparency of the fate of waste and boost local opportunities through job creation and allow for the development of symbiotic relations among regional industries. The SC concept demands commitment from all stakeholders across the product value chain to extract value from the waste without jeopardizing sustainability goals. The application of the SC concept is explained by describing the sustainability challenges and opportunities related to plastic waste management in Europe. To concretize the SC approach and the circularity indicator further, the management of the plastic waste sourcing from the Norwegian fishing sector and plastic waste management in the US are used as case examples.

AB  - Montane Norway spruce forests of Central Europe have a very long tradition of use for timber production; however, recently there has been increasing concern for their role in maintaining biological diversity. This concern, coupled with recent severe windstorms that led to wide-spread bark beetle outbreaks, has brought the management of montane spruce forests to the forefront of public policy discussions in Central Europe. In order to shed light on the natural development and current structure of mature montane spruce forests, we established four 0.25 ha research plots in a semi-natural montane spruce forest in the Sumava Mountains (The Bohemian Forest), Czech Republic. We mapped all trees, extracted increment cores for age and growth-pattern analyses, and inventoried all current tree regeneration, including the substrates on which it was found. Stands were characterized by uni-modal tree diameter distributions and high basal areas (56.6 m(2) ha(-1) on average), indicating a natural transition from the stem exclusion phase towards the understory reinitiation phase. The stands showed largely single-cohort recruitment age structures, however, with recruitment spanning seven decades. Our analyses suggest that this cohort existed as advance regeneration prior to major disturbances in the late 1800s, which included post-bark beetle salvage logging. Spatial pattern analyses of living and dead stems combined, showed an increase in uniformity of living trees, pointing to the role of natural density-dependent mortality. However, past growth patterns and historical documentation suggest that low intensity canopy disturbances (wind and snow) also caused mortality and diversified canopy structure. Because the stands developed naturally over the past 120+ years and thus escaped thinning operations, high volumes of coarse woody debris (94 m(3) ha(-1)) and snag densities (546 stems ha(-1)) have accrued. Advance spruce regeneration was quite abundant and existed primarily on deadwood substrates, even though these occupied only a small percent of stand area. Because of salvage logging in the late 1880s, these stands do not qualify, according to the traditional paradigm, as natural spruce forests. As a result, they are recently subject to active management practices including salvage logging that remove dead and dying trees. Given the importance of deadwood for forest regeneration and recovery from disturbance, as demonstrated in this study, we argue that dead wood removal may limit future natural regeneration in these stands. Thus, the purported benefits of removing dead and dying trees from semi-natural forests must be carefully weighed against the potential detrimental impacts on natural spruce forest regeneration and biodiversity.

AB  - Given the institutional and financial opportunity to choose any school public or private/independent - in the city, how are we to understand students choosing to stay in their low-performing, high-poverty schools with bad reputations? Drawing on interviews with 53 students from two urban schools in Stockholm and Malmo, as well as on the secondary literature and theoretical perspectives on community discourse and the freedom of choice policy, I argue that we will never understand why students choose to stay if we consider only the values of the pedagogical commodities exchanged in the educational quasi-market. The analytical gaze ought to embrace sociological perspectives on the local community and schools, including individual strategies in relation to school choice and the power of relations, categorization and stigmatization. Thus, I conclude that neither deficiency in information, transportation costs and time nor some murky cultural-religious incentives are behind the decision to stay. The major incentive can be found in the ongoing negotiations between different aspects of community and school discourse that young people develop, whereby, among other things, the prospect of losing a network and the feeling of safety and becoming an outsider in exchange for gaining access to a 'Swedish' middle-class school is, for the time being, not deemed a fair deal.

AB  - Brown crab Cancer pagurus supports one of the most important fisheries in Europe; however, spatial patterns of connectivity and adaptation are largely unknown and difficult to identify due to the species' life history, which entails distinct dispersal characteristics during larval and adult life stages. To address this limitation, spatial-temporal genetic structure using 8 microsatellite loci was assessed across the majority of the species' NE Atlantic distribution. Neutral genetic structuring revealed a background of high gene flow throughout the region, with a superimposed pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness (CGP) linked to stochastic recruitment variability. The CGP was geographically patterned, being prevalent among English Channel samples but absent among North Sea samples, suggesting specific biological (e.g. reproductive ecology) and environmental (seascape) drivers. Such recruitment variability may compromise stock resilience and must be considered within spatial management strategies. Another prominent feature was pronounced differentiation at a single locus for males sampled within a single fjord (Gulmarsfjord) from all other samples, exhibiting the effects of divergent selection. Gulmarsfjord females were genetically similar to all other 'non-fjord' samples, and exhibited a comparative level of differentiation at the outlier locus from the Gulmarsfjord males. Due to known dispersal differences between the sexes, the pattern within Gulmarsfjord can be explained by the intermingling of allochthonous females with resident, locally adapted males and demonstrates the occurrence of fine-scale local adaptation in this species. Collectively, the study highlights how considerable intraspecific eco-evolutionary diversification can occur despite high levels of dispersal/gene flow.

AB  - Knowledge about large-scale and long-term dynamics of (natural) populations is required to assess the efficiency of control strategies, the potential for long-term persistence, and the adaptability to global changes such as habitat fragmentation and global warming. For most natural populations, such as pest populations, large-scale and long-term surveys cannot be carried out at a high resolution. For instance, for population dynamics characterized by irregular abundance explosions, i.e., outbreaks, it is common to report detected outbreaks rather than measuring the population density at every location and time event. Here, we propose a mechanical-statistical model for analyzing such outbreak occurrence data and making inference about population dynamics. This spatio-temporal model contains the main mechanisms of the dynamics and describes the observation process. This construction enables us to account for the discrepancy between the phenomenon scale and the sampling scale. We propose the Bayesian method to estimate model parameters, pest densities and hidden factors, i.e., variables involved in the dynamics but not observed. The model was specified and used to learn about the dynamics of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr., an insect causing major defoliation of pines in northern Europe) based on Finnish sawfly data covering the years 1961-1990. In this application, a dynamical Beverton-Holt model including a hidden regime variable was incorporated into the model to deal with large variations in the population densities. Our results gave support to the idea that pine sawfly dynamics should be studied as metapopulations with alternative equilibria. The results confirmed the importance of extreme minimum winter temperatures for the occurrence of European pine sawfly outbreaks. The strong positive connection between the ratio of lake area over total area and outbreaks was quantified for the first time.

AB  - High levels of organochlorines (OCs) have been measured in arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from Lake Ellasjoen on Bjornoya, Norway (74.30 degrees N, 19.0 degrees E). In a nearby lake, Laksvatn, the OC-levels in arctic char were low. A previous study has shown that char from Ellasjoen had significantly higher levels of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) than char from Lake Laksvatn. Even though there is increasing evidence of the genotoxic effects of OCs, little is known about the effects of OCs on the DNA repair system. The aim of the present study was to determine if the two main DNA DSB repair mechanisms, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), are affected by the higher OC and DSB level in char from Ellasjoen. This was analysed by comparing the transcript level of 11 genes involved in DNA DSB repair in char liver samples from EllasjOen (n = 9) with char from Laksvatn (n = 12). Six of the investigated genes were significantly upregulated in char from EllasjOen. As the expression of DNA DSB repair genes was increased in the contaminant-exposed char, it is likely that the DNA DSB repair capacity is induced in these individuals. This induction was positively correlated with the DNA DSB and negatively correlated with one or several OCs for four of these genes. However, the strongest predictor variable for DNA repair genes was habitat, indicating genetic differences in repair capacity between populations. As char from Ellasjoen still had significantly higher levels of DSBs compared to char from Laksvatn, it is possible that chronic exposure to OCs and continued production of DSB has caused selective pressure within the population for fixation of adaptive alleles. It is also possible that DSB production was exceeding the repair capacity given the prevailing conditions, or that the OC or DSB level was above the threshold value of inhibition of the DNA repair system resulting in the rate of DNA damage exceeding the rate of repair.

AB  - The maritime transport sector is often considered hard to abate in the context of greenhouse gas emissions, and the adoption of low-emission marine fuels is slow. Low-emission marine fuels are essential to create a sustainable maritime sector, but to accelerate the speed of adoption, we must understand what hinders their use. This paper outlines the complexity of the marine fuel choice and describes the market landscape. Taking a bottom-up perspective, we investigate the stakeholders ' perspective on low-emission marine fuels. Through thematic analysis, barriers and drivers are analyzed for adopting low-emission marine fuels in Swedish maritime cargo transport, using primary qualitative data from 17 semi-structured interviews. The results confirm previously established barriers, such as fuel price, but expand on the current discourse by incorporating qualitative dimensions. We also identified five specific business models for low-emission marine fuel use. Shipping companies trust that investments in sustainable alternatives will eventually pay off. Despite this, the adoption is slow. The themes reveal a sector that wants to transform but often lacks drivers without well-developed legislation. By directing attention to these themes and the underlying complexities, we provide valuable insight to decisionmakers and policymakers on what can be done to accelerate the share of low-emission marine fuels.

AB  - Intraterrestrial life has been found at depths of several thousand metres in deep sub-sea floor sediments and in the basement crust beneath the sediments. It has also been found at up to 2800-m depth in continental sedimentary rocks, 5300-m depth in igneous rock aquifers and in fluid inclusions in ancient salt deposits from salt mines. The biomass of these intraterrestrial organisms may be equal to the total weight of all marine and terrestrial plants. The intraterrestrial microbes generally seem to be active at very low but significant rates and several investigations indicate chemolithoautotrophs to form a chemosynthetic base. Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide gases are continuously generated in the interior of our planet and probably constitute sustainable sources of carbon and energy for deep intraterrestrial biosphere ecosystems. Several prospective research areas are foreseen to focus on the importance of microbial communities For metabolic processes such as anaerobic utilisation of hydrocarbons and anaerobic methane oxidation.

AB  - This article aims to define the category of energy colonialism in order to analyse the conflicts that are arising due to the deployment of renewable energy megaprojects in the Global South and in the peripheries of the Global North. First, the limits of the corporate energy transition are questioned, and based on an exhaustive bibliographic review, the category of energy colonialism is formulated along with six dimensions that characterise it: geopolitical; economic and financial inequalities; power, violence, and decision making; land grabbing and dispossession; impacts on territories and commons; resistance and socio-territorial conflicts. Based on this framework, we analyse and juxtapose different expressions of energy colonialism in four case studies; the isthmus of Tehuantepec (Oaxaca, Mexico), the territories of Western Sahara occupied by Morocco, the Saami territory in Norway, and the rural territories of Spain. The results from this study allow us to conclude that energy colonialism is a useful concept for understanding and critiquing the effects of the corporate energy transition and establishing a base for grassroots and decolonial alternatives in both the Global North and South.

AB  - Changes in climate are influencing the distribution and abundance of the world's biota, with significant consequences for biological diversity and ecosystem processes. Recent work has raised concern that populations of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) may be particularly susceptible to population declines under environmental change. Moreover, effects of climate change may be especially pronounced in high latitude ecosystems. Here, we examine population dynamics in an assemblage of subarctic forest moths in Finnish Lapland to assess current trajectories of population change. Moth counts were made continuously over a period of 32years using light traps. From 456 species recorded, 80 were sufficiently abundant for detailed analyses of their population dynamics. Climate records indicated rapid increases in temperature and winter precipitation at our study site during the sampling period. However, 90% of moth populations were stable (57%) or increasing (33%) over the same period of study. Nonetheless, current population trends do not appear to reflect positive responses to climate change. Rather, time-series models illustrated that the per capita rates of change of moth species were more frequently associated negatively than positively with climate change variables, even as their populations were increasing. For example, the per capita rates of change of 35% of microlepidoptera were associated negatively with climate change variables. Moth life-history traits were not generally strong predictors of current population change or associations with climate change variables. However, 60% of moth species that fed as larvae on resources other than living vascular plants (e.g. litter, lichen, mosses) were associated negatively with climate change variables in time-series models, suggesting that such species may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Overall, populations of subarctic forest moths in Finland are performing better than expected, and their populations appear buffered at present from potential deleterious effects of climate change by other ecological forces.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify key financial instruments for the financial capacity of the combined territorial communities' (TC) enhancement in Ukraine under conditions of their sustainable development and decentralization implementation. Based on the European experience in reforming state power, it has been determined that strengthening the financial framework and competence of local self-government is an effective mechanism for stimulating economic activity, elaborating effective strategies for regional and local development. The methods of consolidation of European municipalities are as follows: stimulation of voluntary association (Czech Republic, Latvia) and administrative consolidation (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Bulgaria). The approaches to the effectiveness assessment of territorial communities in Germany and Ukraine, which include analysis of the financial base, investment reserves, amounts of municipal investments, have been highlighted. Comparative analysis of financial capacity of the territorial communities of Ukraine, Germany, France, Poland, Romania on indicators is carried out: own income per capita; dynamics of receipts of local taxes and fees; the level of subsidy of budgets; the specific weight of expenditures on the maintenance of the management apparatus in the financial resources of TC. It has been determined that the main forms of state support of territorial communities in Ukraine are subventions, grants, transfer of state-owned objects of communal property, international technical and financial assistance, and funds of the state budget of regional development. In order to ensure the sustainable development of territorial communities in Ukraine, the introduction of new financial instruments for state support of territorial communities (community-based local development, integrated territorial investments, and green bonds) and directions of development of territorial communities has been proposed.

AB  - In the Mediterranean climate of this study the growing period (and hence spraying period) for horticultural crops usually occurs from late spring to summer (i.e. October-March). However, runoff predominantly occurs in winter (late April-October) since there is insufficient rain in the spring and summer period for runoff to occur. It is therefore important to establish the runoff potential of pesticide, despite the long contact time with soil. We studied the distribution of the loads transported during individual runoff events, and the proportion of total annual load transported in each event over three seasons. Some insecticides and fungicides (pirimicarb, procymidone, carbaryl, fenarimol and penconazole) transported off-site from and apple and cherry orchard over a period of 30 months showed a strong association between peak pesticide load and peak flow during individual flow events. Others (particularly chlorpyrifos) however showed no obvious relationship between flow and load transported off-site. Throughout the year certain pesticides demonstrated behaviour characteristic of those chemicals that move in the first flush of drainage water in the season. This was particularly evident for pirimicarb, bupirimate, carbaryl and fenarimol, which all have K-oc values < 1000 L/kg. However, for other pesticides the percentage of total annual load transported off-site either increased or remained fairly constant for several runoff events during the season which was most obvious for chlorpyrifos followed by penconazole and procymidone - all with Koc values >= 1500 L/kg. Generally, the total amount of pesticide moving off-site from both orchards was < 0.5% of the total mass of active ingredient applied, except fenarimol (0.54-2.1%). Only chlorpyrifos, however, showed a positive linear relationship between the load transported off-site during an event and total rainfall (R-2 = 0.48, n = 26). The results from this study have implications for the development of management strategies to minimise pesticide transport to waterways. Crown Copyright 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For animal populations in many parts of the world, direct (albeit often accidental) killing by humans may be a significant source of mortality. Many snakes are killed by people (especially by automobiles) every year, but the determinants of a snake's vulnerability to anthropogenic mortality land thus, patterns of mortality with respect to sex, age and season) are poorly known. We present data on 652 French snakes of six species (Coluber viridiflavus, Elaphe longissima, natrix maura, N. natrix, Vipera aspis, V. berus) killed either by natural predators, domestic animals or humans (including roadkills). We used information on seasonal patterns of mortality (plus information on population structure from 338 captures of live snakes) to test the hypothesis that snakes are killed mostly when they disperse from their usual home ranges. This hypothesis generates several falsifiable predictions on the expected correlates of mortality rates; most of these predictions are supported by our data. For example, young-of-the-year snakes are killed primarily in the period immediately after hatching (while they disperse); subadults (which are sedentary) generally experience low mortality rates; adult males are killed mainly during the mating season (especially in species where mate-searching males travel widely); and adult females in oviparous species are killed during their egg-laying migrations. Relative to population density, species that use frequent long-distance movements in foraging experience higher mortality than sedentary ambush foragers. In one species (E. longissima), larger males are more at risk. The success of these predictions suggests that movement patterns of snakes may offer valuable indices of their vulnerability to direct anthropogenic mortality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - It has been recognized that Polymer Modified Bitumens (PMB) have more potential for use in asphalt paving and can clearly demonstrate the value of their initial higher cost. To further assess sustainable benefits on heavy trafficked roads, test sections using various PMBs were built on highway E6 in Sweden during 2003-2006. The main objective of this paper is to study the aging and rheological properties of the binders used. A large number of cores were drilled and characterized with respect to stiffness, fatigue and permanent deformation. The binders (original, lab aged and recovered) were investigated extensively with rheological and chemical methods. It was found that PMBs, particularly SBS modified, demonstrate better rheological properties as compared to unmodified bitumens, even after several years in the field. These include higher strain recovery and lower non-recoverable compliance at high temperatures, and lower stiffness at low temperatures. For the SBS modified binders, good aging resistance was observed. The high resistance to aging for the SBS modified binders was also evident in the stiffness measurement made on asphalt field cores. Although significant differences have not yet been seen between the test sections (all the sections are in good condition after six years of traffic), the observed improvements for the modified binders are expected to be confirmed by a longer follow-up of the test road.

AB  - Background: Inequity in health is a global concern. Even in Sweden there are considerable health gaps between different social groups, not least concerning life-style related conditions. Interventions drawing on Community-based participatory research (CBPR) have potential to build prerequisites for complex, supportive structures that constitute basis for implementation of sustainable health promoting programs. CBPR rests on principles of empowerment. The researchers are responsible for the scientific quality and that ethical standards are met. Health Equilibrium Initiative (HEI) aims at narrowing the health gap and promoting healthy weight in children; "healthy weight" including both anthropometric criteria and aspects having to do with self-esteem and self-efficacy. Evaluation objectives are to compare outcome between children in intervention and control areas, conduct health economic assessments (HEA) and evaluate the processes of the project.
   Methods/design: HEI is a repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal study. The Program Logic Model is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Intervention Mapping. Primary contact groups are children in disadvantaged communities. Core efforts are to confirm and convey knowledge, elucidate and facilitate on-going health work and support implementation of continuous health work. Socioeconomic status is assessed on area level by the parameters yearly average income, degree of employment, tertiary education and percent of inhabitants born in countries where violent conflicts recently have taken place or were ongoing. Anthropometry, food patterns, physical activity and belief in ability to affect health; together with learning, memory and attention assessment will be assessed in 350 children (born 2006). Examinations will be repeated after two years, forming the basis of a health economic analysis. The process evaluation procedure will use document analysis (such as structured reports from meetings and dialogues, school/workplaces policies and curriculum, food service menus); key informant interviews and focus groups with parents, children and professionals.
   Discussion: Inviting, awaiting and including local perspectives create mutual confidence and collaboration. Enhanced self-efficacy and access to relevant knowledge has potential to enable individuals and communities to choose alternatives that are relevant for their health and well-being in a long perspective. The economic of this study may contribute in decision-making processes regarding appropriate public health interventions.

AB  - Human bear conflicts occur frequently in the Pasvik Valley, Norway. We used a variant of the hair-trapping method with higher densities of traps (2.5 x 2.5 km grid) to detect brown bears moving near human settlements and livestock. We distributed 20 hair traps for one month close to a farm with frequent observations of grazing bears. The study area consisted of one area close to the farm, and one adjacent area without settlements. We collected 85 hair samples and identified 13 different individuals by STR analysis. In the farm area, we detected 4 different males once, and a female that was detected in both areas. In comparison, nine bears (2 males and 7 females) were detected for more than one week in the area without settlements, suggesting lower roaming activity. Conclusively, hair trapping has the potential to survey bears at specific locations of importance to the wildlife management.

AB  - Marine plastic litter is ubiquitous and knowledge about its impact on coasts, open waters, the deep-sea, and the biota found in those habitats is increasing. However, studies of how it affects terrestrial environments such as islands are not as common. Over time, macroplastics in marine, as well as terrestrial environments, will fragment into microplastics. A toxic level of microplastic is defined by characteristics of the specific organisms and the habitat it affects, but also of the plastic itself. Plastic litter is being collected from wilderness areas through beach-cleanups by volunteers, schools and professionals. A question that needs to be addressed is whether macroplastic that is partially weathered and buried under vegetation should be taken out of the topsoil layer or left untouched to further degrade with the risk of negative impacts on soil organisms or removed from the topsoil layer. A quantification of the amount of plastic found within the topsoil layer is therefore of great interest. In this study, a survey was conducted in spring/autumn 2020 at Mausund and Froan landscape conservation area in Freya municipality, Norway (N63 degrees). Thirteen samples of vegetated soil from above the storm tide limit from eight remote and uninhabited islands were collected, quantified and analyzed, and the results showed high amounts of plastic. Potential future concentrations of microplastic in the samples if left untouched are estimated, based on a formula from existing literature.

AB  - Cultivated bivalves are important not only because of their economic value, but also due to their impacts on natural ecosystems. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is the world's most heavily cultivated shellfish species and has been introduced to all continents except Antarctica for aquaculture. We therefore used a medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to investigate the genetic structure of this species in Europe, where it was introduced during the 1960s and has since become a prolific invader of coastal ecosystems across the continent. We analyzed 21,499 polymorphic SNPs in 232 individuals from 23 localities spanning a latitudinal cline from Portugal to Norway and including the source populations of Japan and Canada. We confirmed the results of previous studies by finding clear support for a southern and a northern group, with the former being indistinguishable from the source populations indicating the absence of a pronounced founder effect. We furthermore conducted a large-scale comparison of oysters sampled from the wild and from hatcheries to reveal substantial genetic differences including significantly higher levels of inbreeding in some but not all of the sampled hatchery cohorts. These findings were confirmed by a smaller but representative SNP dataset generated using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We therefore conclude that genomic approaches can generate increasingly detailed insights into the genetics of wild and hatchery produced Pacific oysters.

AB  - Increasing interest for the landfill mining and the amount of fine fraction (FF) in landfills (40-70% (w/w) of landfill content) mean that sustainable treatment and utilization methods for FF are needed. For this study FF (<20 mm) was mined from a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill operated from 1967 to 1989. FF, which resembles soil, was stabilized in laboratory scale reactors in two phases: first, anaerobically for 101 days and second, for 72 days using four different methods: anaerobic with the addition of moisture (water) or inoculum (sewage sludge) and aerobic with continuous water washing, with, or without, bulking material. The aim was to evaluate the effect on the stability of mined FF, which has been rarely reported, and to study the quality and quantity of gas and leachate produced during the stabilization experiment. The study showed that aerobic treatment reduced respiration activity (final values 0.9-1.1 mg O-2/g TS) and residual methane potential (1.1 L CH4/kg TS) better than anaerobic methods (1.8-2.3 mg O-2/g TS and 1.3-2.4 L CH4/kg TS, respectively). Bulking material mixed in FF in one aerobic reactor had no effect on the stability of FF. The benefit of anaerobic treatment was the production of methane, which could be utilized as energy. Even though the inoculum addition increased methane production from FF about 30%, but the methane production was still relatively low (in total 1.5-1.7 L CH4/kg TS). Continuous water washing was essential to remove leachable organic matter and soluble nutrients from FF, while increasing the volume of leachate collected. In the aerobic treatment, nitrogen was oxidized into nitrite and nitrate and then washed out in the leachate. Both anaerobic and aerobic methods could be used for FF stabilization. The use of FF, in landscaping for example, is possible because its nutrient content (4 g N/kg TS and 1 g P/kg TS) can increase the nutrient content of soil, but this may have limitations due to the possible presence of heavy metal and other contaminants.

AB  - This paper presents the provision of "credit plus" training activities, conditionally and jointly with microloans by Equity Bank and by Swedish non-governmental organization Vi-Skogen in the area of Kisumu, Kenya to women's groups as a key to improving women's capacity to adapt to climate change. Groups received training in small business administration and agroforestry, which produced positive outcomes or a virtuous spiral in their families' economy, well-being and in their intra-household bargaining power. In agroforestry and new farming practices, group training enhanced the women's set of planned adaptation strategies. In a context where formal financial institutions are still reluctant to provide credit to subsistence farmers, this case study shows the beneficial effects that credit would generate for women's adaptive capacity.

AB  - Most parts of the Circumpolar Arctic have only discontinuous evidence for long-term human settlement. In contrast, Northern Norway has an unbroken archaeological record that extends back to the early Holocene. Numerous high-resolution archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records have been generated by commercial excavations and surveys, offering archaeologists unique opportunities to investigate long-term human ecodynamics in an Arctic coastal setting. To date, however, deeper analysis of the new datasets has yet to be undertaken. This paper aims to present a new synthesis of early and mid Holocene archaeological and paleoenvironmental sequences for Western Finnmark (11500-2000 cal BP). This enables us to identify three major phases of culture change that broadly correlate with climatic and environmental shifts. We then present emerging results from our multi-scalar analysis of the processes driving these transformations. At supra regional and regional scales, our palaeodemographic modelling indicates major population events centered around 6000 cal BP and 4000 cal BP. At intra-regional scales, we are identifying spatial clustering of prehistoric settlements into local socio-economic communities. At the scale of local settlements, our analysis of housepit chronologies is clarifying the degree of simultaneous occupation and re-use. We also draw on recent research into rock art and ritual landscapes in an effort to reconstruct the relationship between settlement clusters and general interaction patterns. Integration of these diverse lines of evidence is generating a vivid picture of thriving Arctic coastal communities, with indications that the timing and pace of cultural responses to climatic and environmental changes were more complex than previously thought.

AB  - We present the first multi-site study of dinoflagellate cyst records spanning ca. AD 1860-2000 from the west Iberian coast. Our aim was to reconstruct environmental changes in the Western Iberia Upwelling Ecosystem, one of the most biologically productive areas in the world, and an active fishery region. A major shift in cyst assemblages was recorded off the northwestern shelf sector between 1920 and 1950 towards autotrophic dominance, and consisted of a multi-fold increase in total cyst concentrations and cysts of Lingulodinium polyedrum, accompanied by an increase in Protoceratium reticulatum cysts. The observed changes pre-date the industrialization of agriculture in Portugal, and are concomitant with a shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards negative indices (higher river input) and increasing sea-surface temperatures. The southernmost record, with reduced river- and human influence, showed only minor changes during the 20th century. Here, an increase in Protoperidinioid cysts after the 1980s is related to upwelling intensification. Our study indicates that the main changes recorded in the Western Iberian Upwelling system during the 20th century were driven by regional climate variability (warming, increased water stability and nutrient availability), possibly enhanced by anthropogenic nutrient input from the second half of the century. Our results highlight the complexity of the environmental drivers that may act upon dinoflagellate communities within the same region. The 20th-century environmental change in the Western Iberian Ecosystem has resulted in a shift towards marked autotrophic dominance of dinoflagellate cyst communities, and the northward expansion of species associated with Harmful Algal Blooms.

AB  - A previously described model for the evaluation of sustainability in waste management has been expanded and applied to biodegradable and other combustible household waste. The model was applied to a case-study focusing on the special conditions in a municipality in the sparsely populated region of northern Sweden. In this region it is usual that the collection distances are long, the volume of waste is low and treatment facilities are remote. Four scenarios for the management of municipal household waste were compared: incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting and landfilling. A system analysis was performed to ensure that each scenario fulfil all the functions that the waste could provide (heat, electricity, fuel, and soil with a high nutrient content) and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the reliability of the results. The results show that the evaluation model can be used to assess the sustainability aspects of different treatment scenarios for combustible household waste. The model also allows for an individual interpretation of the results presented, depending on the choice of priorities. The effects of varying the time horizons and the difference in impact depending on what fuels are ultimately replaced in energy production are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Of all materials extracted from the earth's crust, the construction sector uses 50%, producing huge amounts of construction and demolition waste (CDW). In Beijing, presently 35 million metric tons per year (megatonnes/year [Mt/yr]) of CDW are generated. This amount is expected to grow significantly when the first round of mass buildings erected in the 1990s starts to be demolished. In this study, a dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) is conducted for Beijing's urban housing system, with the demand for the stock of housing floor area taken as the driver. The subsequent effects on construction and demolition flows of housing floor area and the concurrent consumption and waste streams of concrete are investigated for Beijing from 1949 and projected through 2050. The per capita floor area (PCFA) is a key factor shaping the material stock of housing. Observations in Beijing, the Netherlands, and Norway indicate that PCFA has a strong correlation with the local gross domestic product (GDP). The lifetime of dwellings is one of the most important variables influencing future CDW generation. Three scenarios, representing the current trend extension, high GDP growth, and lengthening the lifetime of dwellings, are analyzed. The simulation results show that CDW will rise, unavoidably. A higher growth rate of GDP and the consequent PCFA will worsen the situation in the distant future. Prolonging the lifetime of dwellings can postpone the arrival of the peak CDW. From a systematic view, recycling is highly recommended for long-term sustainable CDW management.

AB  - Purpose Smart city services are supported by information and communication technologies (ICT) referred to as digital technologies which increasingly promise huge opportunities for growth but are faced with system alignment and data integration issues when providing digital services. Therefore, this study aims to use enterprise architecture (EA) in digital transformation of cities by developing an architecture to address system alignment and data integration in digital transformation of cities. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative method is applied to evaluate the presented architecture based on electric-mobility (e-mobility) scenario, and data was collected using case study via interviews from a municipality in Norway to validate the applicability of EA for digital transformation of city services. Findings Findings from the interviews were represented in ArchiMate language to model the digital transformation of e-mobility in smart cities. Findings suggest that the architecture serves as a guide to recommend urban administrators of the potential of EA and digital transformation in addressing system alignment and data integration issues in smart cities. Research limitations/implications Data used in this study is from a single case, hence there is a need to evaluate the application of EA for digital transformation of city services with data collected from multi-cases. Practical implications This study adopts enterprise architecture approach to support city transformation as it has been widely applied by institutions to align business and ICT components. Social implications This study provides implication on how municipalities can use EA and digital transformations towards a sustainable smart city. Originality/value An architecture is presented that can be used as a guide to help urban developers and designers in deploying sustainable transport policies for smart cities. Additionally, EA is used to foster digitalization towards achieving system alignment and data integration in cities to support urban environment as they digitally transform services provided to citizens.

AB  - Deadwood is a resource of water, nutrients, and carbon, as well as an important driving factor of spatial pedocomplexity and hillslope processes in forested landscapes. The applicability of existing relevant studies in mountain forests in Central Europe is limited by the low number of data, absence of precise dating, and short time periods studied. Here, we aimed to assess the decomposition pathway in terms of changes and variability in the physical characteristics of deadwood (wood density, biomass, and moisture) during the decomposition process, and to describe differences in decomposition rate. The research was carried out in the ZofinskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Primeval Forest, one of the oldest forest reserves in Europe. Samples were taken from sapwood of downed logs of the three main tree species: Fagus sylvatica L., Abies alba Mill., and Picea abies (L.) Karst. The time since the death of each downed log was obtained using tree censuses repeated since 1975 and dendrochronology. The maximal time since the death of a log was species-specific, and ranged from 61-76 years. The rate of change (slope) of moisture content along the time since death in a linear regression model was the highest for F. sylvatica (b = 3.94) compared to A. alba (b = 2.21) and P. abies (b = 1.93). An exponential model showing the dependence of biomass loss on time since death revealed that F. sylvatica stems with a diameter of 50-90 cm had the shortest decomposition rate-51 years-followed by P. abies (71 years) and A. alba (72 years). Our findings can be used in geochemical models of element cycles in temperate old-growth forests, the prediction of deadwood dynamics and changes in related biodiversity, and in refining management recommendations.

AB  - This article explores the spatiotemporal and affective qualities of linguistic landscapes at three linguistically diverse neighborhoods in Helsinki, Finland. The three sites were selected for qualitative fieldwork using a method that combines social media and population registry data with quantitative measures of diversity and spatial analytics. The article demonstrates how each site is characterized by its own distinct affective atmosphere, which is discursively construed and made sense of through references to other places and times. The timespace analysis of affects provides conceptual and methodological tools that allow analyzing the change and circulation of social meanings in the landscape, as well as differences in these aspects across settings.

AB  - Pressure-resistant circulating systems were constructed to enable the investigation of attached and unattached microbial populations under in situ pressure (2.5MPa), diversity, dissolved gas and chemistry conditions. Three parallel flow cell cabinets were configured to allow observation of the effect on microbial metabolic activity of adding 3mM hydrogen or 2.4mM acetate, compared with an untreated control. Hydrogen addition reduced the generation time fourfold to 2weeks, doubled the sulphide production rate and increased acetate production by approximately 50%. The acetate addition induced acetate consumption. The studied subterranean microbial processes appeared to proceed very slowly in terms of volume and time, although the results suggest that individual cells could be very active. Lytic bacteriophages are hypothesized to have caused this contradictive observation. Phages may consequently significantly reduce the rates of subterranean microbial processes. Furthermore, the results suggest that hydrogen from corroding underground constructions could induce significant local microbial activity and that the low concentrations of hydrogen often observed in pristine subterranean environments may support slow but sustainable microbial activity in deep groundwater.

AB  - 1. Pest management is essential to maintain agricultural production, but recent shifts in policies and the development of insecticide resistance have restricted the availability of insecticides for pest suppression. Identifying the landscape-level resource requirements of pests to complete their life cycles might unveil new sustainable solutions to regulate their populations and prevent crop damage.2. We assessed the effects of landscape composition and configuration at different spatial scales on flea beetle densities and crop damage in 56 spring oilseed rape fields sampled over 5 years in Sweden. We considered the cover of non- crop habitats as an aspect of landscape composition and the distances to the host crop and an alternative host crop in the previous year, edge density and crop diversity as aspects of landscape configuration.3. The distance from spring oilseed rape in the previous year reduced flea beetle densities and crop damage across most species and spatial scales. Edge density reduced the densities of two flea beetle species, predominantly at the 500 m ra- dius landscape scale. The cover of forests and permanent pastures as well as crop diversity in the previous year increased the densities of different species at several, mostly larger (1000- 2000 m) spatial scales. Increasing permanent pasture cover at the 500 m scale also increased crop damage.4. Synthesis and applications: We find that there is no one fits all approach in designing landscapes for flea beetle regulation as habitat use and scales of effect are species-specific for these pests. However, increasing the spatiotemporal isolation of host crop fields is a promising and potentially more general means of disrupting pest populations and reducing crop damage. Considering the ecological traits of the pest species is a possible next step to optimise landscape -based pest management.

AB  - Modem health system research emphasises the transition from mortality statistics, via morbidity and risk factors observations to comparative site explorations in defined al ens. The health of women fi om the perspective of their gender has become a priority in medical research over the last decade. Studies of morbidity have been called for as necessary intermediary stage for hypothesis generation, and the formulation and inception of epidemiological projects which ale recognized as essential for attaining knowledge on rite factors and circumstances that deter-mine diseases and wellbeing in the general population. This applies especially to cancel; where the importance of seeing disease, from a ecological, cultural as well as gender context is evident. We made a comparative analysis of the hospitalization for somatic diseases during 1986-1987 at the Heraklion University Hospital on Crete, and the commensurable Linkoping University Hospital in the country of Ostergotland, Sweden. They are representative of their complementary Europian situations and comprise the total hospital admissions in there regions. Large differences were found, notably regarding both cardiovascular diseases and cancer; with lower morbidity in the more 'arcadian' rural circumstances. The results provide unique data on traits and patterns intermediate to the pioneering observations of the Seven Countries survey on the rapidly changing European scene. In the field of cancel the data are effectively unmatched both as raw data and as a platform for further investigation, which we are presently pursuing under the emblem of 'Ariadne's thread'. From a salutogenetic point of view the elderly rural women on CI-ere, and from a pathogenetic point of view the elderly urban women in Linkoping warrant particular attention.

AB  - The concept of energy management (EnM) became a topical issue in industrial settings as a result of the energy crises that affected the global community in the 1970s. However, EnM was not implemented within industry with all its potential to improve energy security, raise the maturity level of EnM and increase sustainability. According to the results of previous empirical investigations, the expected interest in energy programs is not found and there is no clear understanding about program adoption criteria within an industry. Keeping in mind the adoption of energy investment through conformation with financial analysis and choosing the investments through contextual factors in the organization (e.g. organizational energy culture, power relationships, EnM system, expertise availability, managers' mindset) together with characteristics of EnM program as two macro perspectives in energy efficiency literature, this paper aims to understand the main driving factors which lead organizations to either adopt or not adopt a particular program (always with respect to energy management). Moreover, it aims to express the impact of those driving forces of implementing a successful EnM program which could contribute to better understanding of suitable EnM configuration. The investigation has been conducted as a multiple case study involving 15 manufacturing companies of varying size and in different sectors located in Sweden. After analyzing the minimum required steps to establish EnM, assessing the adoption of practices according to their energy strategy, and through assessing EnM maturity level, we found a low level of risk (which arises from lack of certainty and awareness) and the program's alignment with the core business as prominent driving factors for all sizes which foster positive investment decision making through top management. On the contrary, complexity of industry (for large manufacturing companies) and access to capital (for small and medium-sized companies) are the main barriers to adopting those programs.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - Alternative food networks (AFNs) have the potential to enhance and redistribute value in favour of producers and consumers through novel ways of organizing supply chain activities. What is more, AFNs are often characterized by their 'sustainability promise' - or the idea that their networks foster social, ecological or environmental improvements over conventional food networks. Based on a purposive sample of 286 producers across five Swedish AFNs (i.e. community supported agriculture, REKO-rings, farmers' markets, farm stores and food nodes), we explore how differences in how supply chain activities are managed and relate them to profitability, fair wages, cooperation, logistics efforts, happiness and future beliefs. Using a combination of correlation analysis, linear regression and means comparisons, we challenge the notion that AFNs achieve their sustainability promise or enhance value through novel combinations of supply chain activities. Our findings include several key differences in how supply chain management (SCM) activities are organized across AFNs and their variant importance for profitability. Moreover, we find significant differences in happiness across AFNs that are better explained through beliefs about the future than profitability or fair wages. By exploring happiness and profitability, we offer insights into why some AFN actors thrive despite poor economic returns.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has become one of the catchwords in current higher education and science policies, with the underlying rationale being that scientific breakthroughs and solutions to today's global challenges require collaboration across scientific fields. However, several empirical studies have shown that interdisciplinary promises are not necessarily realised in research practices, due to manifold cognitive, epistemic, cultural and organisational barriers. Drawing on interviews with women academics working in health technology in Finland, this paper traces subtle obstacles, hidden power relations and invisible hierarchies in interdisciplinary research work. A special emphasis is placed on understanding intersections of gender and interdisciplinarity, pointing to gendered implications of the current policy rhetoric of interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Greylag geese (Anser anser) have been increasing in numbers in Europe during the last decades. They forage and roost in agricultural landscapes and may cause damage to sensitive crops. We studied field selection of greylag geese around lake Sorfjarden in south central Sweden where geese aggregate during the growing season. In this area a set-aside field was established in 2010, i.e., a field where geese can graze undisturbed, with the aim to reduce damage in surrounding conventional fields. The goal of our study was to investigate the general selection of the different field types as well as the specific set-aside field. We used a point survey count to estimate goose numbers and regression analyses to evaluate the relationship between presence or absence of greylag geese and field characteristics such as crop type, distance to roost site and field size. According to the top-ranked model, the probability of presence of foraging greylag geese was higher in spring and in grass fields, while the probability decreased with distance to roost site. Our results also show that the set-aside field in general was used more than other fields in the area during spring and summer but not during autumn. We conclude that it is important to consider variables affecting the probability of field selection by geese, such as season, crop type and distance to roosts to understand the behaviour of geese when establishing set-aside fields.

AB  - Natural environmental changes and human activities have altered forest growth for centuries. Recent long-term growth investigations indicate an increasing growth trend in European forests. The investigations are based on forest inventory, permanent plot and tree analysis data. The observed trends are species specific, locally varying and modified by remarkably large periodic growth variations. On a European scale, species and site specific quantitative information about the extent and spatial as well as temporal variation in growth acceleration is lacking. Future growth development may differ from past observations. A better understanding of changes in site conditions, their causes and consequences is needed to guide sustainable management of European forests.

AB  - Clear-cutting is the main forest management method in boreal and hemiboreal forests, but recently its implementation has raised concerns due to its effects on biodiversity, including the soil fungal biota. Forest soil fungi have an important role as mycorrhizal symbionts, decomposers of organic material and root pathogens. There is conflicting information about the effect of clear-cutting and related management practices on fungal assemblages. We aimed to assess the factors that affect the assemblages of major fungal functional guilds (ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, pathogenic and yeast fungi) and the changes in soil fungal diversity and community composition after clear-cutting in Norway spruce and Scots pine (retention trees > 5 m3 per ha) stands, and compared the outcomes with alongside control sites (uncut stands). In addition, we tested the effect of the size of the clear-cut area, soil scarification and the forest regeneration method (planting and sowing) on soil fungi. The samples were collected from 50 different clear-cut sites and 50 control sites on two repeated sampling occasions: recently (0-6 months) cut and one year after clear-cutting. Based on high-throughput Illumina sequencing soil fungal communities were affected immediately after clear-cutting, resulting in significantly different fungal structure composition. Soil fungal diversity in both spruce and pine stands increased after one year post-cut compared to control sites, except the richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi in spruce sites. However, the fungal communities showed the highest similarity between control and one year post-cut sites based on principal coordinates (PCO) and Permanova analyses. Nonetheless, relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi declined, whereas that of saprotrophs and pathogens increased. In spruce sites, saprotrophic fungi were negatively affected by soil scarification, but this was not evident in pine sites. Forest regeneration by planting after clear-cutting in pine sites resulted in higher ectomycorrhizal fungal richness compared to sowing. Size of the clear-cut area (ranging from 0.4 to 3.1 (5.0) ha) did not affect soil fungal diversity in spruce- and pine-dominated sites. We demonstrated that fungal community composition may recover within one year after clear-cutting in pine- and spruce-dominated hemiboreal forest stands. However, understanding the long-term effects of management on patterns and shifts in fungal biota needs a long-term study.

AB  - To identify weather controls of beech diameter growth and masting in southern Sweden, we analyze records of monthly weather, regional masting record, and tree-ring chronologies from five beech-dominated stands. The results indicate a strong weather control of temporal pattern of masting events in southern Sweden over the second half of the 20th century. Negative summer temperature anomaly 2 years prior to a mast year, coupled with positive temperature anomaly in the year immediately preceding the same mast year, is a characteristic weather pattern associated with known mast years. Strong dependence of beech masting behavior on temperature explains the high degree of regional synchronization of masting events. Growth of beech in southern Sweden is strongly and negatively correlated with previous year's summer temperature and positively - with previous year's October temperature. The present study does not provide a conclusive answer in identifying a full set of direct and indirect effects of climatic variables controlling tree-ring growth, since the negative effect of previous year's summer temperature may be a result of a temperature-controlled increase in the beech nut production in the current year. Consistent and significant negative departures of ring-width index during mast years support the hypothesis about a trade-off between investment of bioassimilates into production of beech nuts and tree-ring growth. Alternative explanation of growth anomalies in mast years, relating such anomaly to a negative impact of previous year's growing season, was not supported by the data. We found a limited effect of masting on diameter growth in the following years, indicating that decline in the overall wood production, associated with heavy masting, is short term and typically occurs in the year of actual masting.

AB  - Despite progress on the Millennium and Sustainable Development Goals, significant public health challenges remain to address communicable and non-communicable diseases and health inequities. The Healthier Societies for Healthy Populations initiative convened by WHO's Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research; the Government of Sweden; and the Wellcome Trust aims to address these complex challenges. One starting point is to build understanding of the characteristics of successful government-led interventions to support healthier populations. To this end, this project explored five purposefully sampled, successful public health initiatives: front-of-package warnings on food labels containing high sugar, sodium or saturated fat (Chile); healthy food initiatives (trans fats, calorie labelling, cap on beverage size; New York); the alcohol sales and transport ban during COVID-19 (South Africa); the Vision Zero road safety initiative (Sweden) and establishment of the Thai Health Promotion Foundation. For each initiative a qualitative, semistructured one-on-one interview with a key leader was conducted, supplemented by a rapid literature scan with input from an information specialist. Thematic analysis of the five interviews and 169 relevant studies across the five examples identified facilitators of success including political leadership, public education, multifaceted approaches, stable funding and planning for opposition. Barriers included industry opposition, the complex nature of public health challenges and poor interagency and multisector co-ordination. Further examples building on this global portfolio will deepen understanding of success factors or failures over time in this critical area.

T2  - TIDSSKRIFT FOR SAMFUNNSFORSKNING
LA  - Norwegian
AB  - Environmental impact analysis (EIA) was developed in the USA in the late 1960s, but was not mandated in Norway as a tool for environmental planning until 1989. In this paper, we investigate how EIA in the Norwegian context contributes to the production of knowledge about the environment. Starting from the fairly broad diagnosis provided by the concepts of risk society (Ulrich Beck) and ecological modernization (Maarten Hajer), the assumption is that EIA is consistent with a discursive structure emphasizing particularistic, local and shortterm problems.
   The study is based on an analysis of EIA guidelines provided by relevant government ministries and two case studies, one examining EIA in relation to a planned road development in Trondheim called 'Nordtangenten', the other investigating EIA in relation to plans for a new site for the furniture chain IKEA.
   The results are consistent with expectations about particularism, localness and short-term point of view, but it seems as if the production of knowledge about the environment provided by EIA is less controlled by the discursive structure outlined by guidance manuals and procedures than originally assumed. While the constructors responsible for performing EIA are clearly disciplined by considerations about reducing the environmental impact, the EIA documents become partisan in putting the view that the projects under planning are environmentally sustainable.

Medetera flies lay eggs on beetle-infested trees, where the developing larvae find their prey, but the chemical cues used by Medetera to locate infested trees are currently unknown. To identify odors attracting Medetera signaticornis, a species in Europe, headspace samples were collected at several time-points through different stages of I. typographus attacks on logs of Norway spruce (Picea abies). The headspace samples were analyzed using combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) to determine compounds that stimulate M. signaticornis antennae. Antennae of M. signaticornis males and females were found to detect (-)-cis-verbenol, (+)-trans-verbenol and myrtenol, which are known to be produced by bark beetles. Antennal responses were also observed for verbenene, isoterpinolene, alpha-pinene oxide, camphor, pinocamphone, terpinene-4-ol, myrtenal, borneol, alpha-terpineol, geranyl acetone, and verbenone, which are primarily produced by microorganisms, and alpha-pinene, alpha-fenchene, beta-pinene, camphene, 3-carene, limonene, gamma-terpinene, and terpinolene, known spruce tree compounds. In field experiments testing two synthetic blends containing 18 antennal active and two additional compounds 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol and ipsdienol we observed significant attraction of M. signaticornis within 24 h. These attractive blends can form the basis for development of Medetera monitoring lures for use in future forest and pest management.

TI  - The efficacy of wildlife fences for keeping reindeer outside a chronic wasting disease risk area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Emerging wildlife diseases often comes with negative cultural and economic impact. Limiting disease spread is a recurrent goal and challenge, but the efficacy of various mitigation measures is rarely assessed. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal disease among cervids that was discovered among alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Nordfjella mountain range of Norway in 2016. After de-population, the entire range was fallowed to avoid re-emergence from environmental pathogen reservoirs. This involved installing perimeter fences in the alpine areas in order to keep reindeer from adjacent populations outside of the CWD risk area, while other cervids (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and moose Alces alces) were likely to enter through the forested areas. We used camera trapping and surveillance reports to assess the efficacy of the perimeter fences. All four species of cervids were documented inside the CWD risk area. For reindeer, only 12.0% of observations were inside the CWD risk area, while this was 28.7% for the other cervids. The higher proportion of observations outside of the fenced area indicate that fences provided a barrier and lowered the number of crossings also of red deer, roe deer and moose. Fences do not provide complete barriers, and we discuss practical solutions for how to avoid 'intruders' entering a given area, such as maintenance at critical points (e.g. river and road crossings) and height of fences (e.g. species variation in jumping; deep snow) to uphold their desired effect. We argue that two fence lines with a buffer zone would be required when re-introduction of reindeer are planned in the CWD risk area after fallowing, similar to what has been suggested for other wildlife diseases.

AB  - Habitat preferences of nine adult raccoon dogs were investigated during different seasons using compositional analysis after Aebischer et al. (1993). The study area (33 km(2)) with its mosaic landscape of forest and farmland was located in Southern Brandenburg in eastern Germany (13 degrees 56' E, 51 degrees 37' N). For analysis eight habitat categories were distinguished. Grassland and coniferous woods were favoured both within 95 % fixed-kernel (K95) and within core areas (K50). Grassland offered food at most times of the year and particularly after harvesting of fields. Abandoned badger dens located in coniferous woods within K50 were used by raccoon dogs all year round whereas they apparently avoided anthropogenic structures. Other habitat categories were used randomly and we detected no seasonal differences in relative usage. Such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes dominate the central and western European landscape. Furthermore, short winters and low density of top predators provide beneficial living conditions for raccoon dogs. Its flexibility in habitat use, omnivorous diet and ability to disperse over long distances facilitate a further expansion of the raccoon dog in western and southern Europe.

AB  - Increased global competition in the agricultural sector is rapidly changing the structure of farms and farming. As the number of small and diversified farms (often family-owned) decreases, the number of large and specialized farms (often corporate-owned) is increasing. In this transformation, the agricultural sector is more and more concerned with strategy, innovation, and competition in the effort to be more productive and more profitable. At the same time, the sector faces demands that it become more environmentally responsible in its policies and practices. This paper proposes a Lean Implementation Framework that small and mid-size farms can use as they aim to increase production and profit and yet support environmental sustainability. This case study takes an action-oriented research approach that focuses on the implementation of a Green Lean approach at 34 Swedish farms using various Lean tools. The paper describes how training sessions, farm visits, workshops, and counseling were used to introduce the farmers to the benefits and risks of the implementation of a new business model that added Green elements to the traditional business model design. The paper concludes with recommendations for adaptations to the Framework and suggestions for future research. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The constant consumption of resources exerts pressure on the environment. In this sense, waste management has obtained increasing attention from the view of a circular economy. The European Union deals with these mentioned aspects, trying maintain long-term competitiveness and to provide sustainable development in accordance with all related environmental aspects. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the production of communal waste in 36 EU countries. The main aim is to evaluate the success of countries' efforts to decrease waste production and increase recycling rates. The methodology used for the evaluation included data collected from the publicly available database Eurostat, consequent analyses and evaluation in the statistical software JMP 13 through regression, distribution, and cluster analysis, and the interpretation of the results. The results of the cluster analysis showed that despite clear EU waste management legislation, EU member states have significantly different waste management systems at the national level. However, generally, we could see positive correlation between the generation of waste and recycling rates. Although, Malta, Austria, Greece, and Norway recorded a decreasing level of waste recycling over the last several years, some countries (Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania) had significantly lower recycling rates accompanied by low landfill taxes. The evaluation of waste production and recycling can be used for government policy in the area of waste management, as well as for individual communities dealing with communal waste.

AB  - In many countries, there is increasing interest in promoting relational PDMs to avoid the adverse objectives and conflicts that have characterized the industry due to the use of traditional forms. For countries that are new to this concept, deciding on and shifting from a traditional environment to a collaborative one is not easy while the set-up cost for an extensive relational delivery model is not justified for small, less complex projects of low strategic importance. This study focusses on identifying the project characteristics which indicate the relevance of adopting relational PDM by formulating the following research question:
   Under what project characteristics should a client consider applying a relational project delivery model?
   This study is part of a bigger research project (E39 feryfree project) in Norway, finance by Norwegian Public Road Administration (NPRA), while the authors, combined and examined the data collected in three different study connected to E39 project using qualitative content base analysis. This research concludes with the following project characteristics which show the validity of considering relational PDM as delivery model; Fairly High Level of Uncertainty and Complexity, Time Constraints, High Risk, Large Size and Need for Innovation.

KW  - Napoleonic Wars
KW  - 19th century
AB  - The article focuses on the possibilities of counterfactual history through three showcases from the Scandinavian theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The scenarios are based on clearly described and plausible points of divergence, i.e. single, identifiable historical events that could have resulted in a different outcome. The counterfactuals are explored by means of systematic extrapolation. The first scenario presents the possibility of a Danish victory against the British naval expedition in the Battle of Copenhagen Roads in 1801. The scenario seeks to answer the question whether the Danish victory could have maintained the League of Armed Neutrality intact in some form, keeping Scandinavia out of the Napoleonic Wars altogether. The second scenario describes the Abborfors border dispute of 1803, which historically nearly triggered a war between Sweden and Russia. The extrapolation focuses on the hypothetical consequences of a premature Swedish-Russian conflict in 1803, and its impact on the War of the Third Coalition. The third scenario explores the hypothetical French invasion of Jutland in 1807, and the potential of Scandinavia as a strategic quagmire of the Napoleonic Wars, comparable to what Spain became in our timeline.

AB  - The 'Qualitative Assessment of Difference' method (QAD) is proposed to objectively detect differences in the relative abundance of vegetation between paired sites using pollen percentages. This method corrects for intertaxonomic differences in pollen productivity and neutralizes influences of background pollen on pollen representation of vegetation, using an inverse form of the Extended R-value model. We test the method using modern pollen-vegetation data from small hollows in northern Michigan (6 taxa; 45 sites) and from northwestern Wisconsin (7 taxa; 43 sites) in the USA. Compared with pollen percentages, the one-tailed Fisher Exact test shows that the QAD method significantly improves the accuracy of the results for all taxa. The rank order of sites based on QAD is significantly correlated to the rank order of sites based on a survey of vegetation composition surrounding the hollow for each taxon (Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients; p < 0.001). We apply QAD to 9000-yr pollen records from two forest hollows c. 6 km apart in northern Michigan. Among seven taxa compared, Pinus, a taxon with well-dispersed pollen and a high pollen producer, often displays discrepancies in the direction of difference between QAD and the percentage-based method, demonstrating that pollen percentages alone do not always reflect differences in vegetation composition accurately. When several similarly sized sites are available in the same vegetation zone, QAD can objectively rank-order sites for individual taxa in relation to, for example, differences in soils, topography, patterns of species invasion, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and other factors.

AB  - Salmonid rickettsial septicemia (SRS) or piscirickettsiosis has historically been the most important health problem of farmed salmonids during the growth-out production phase in the Chilean industry. SRS is caused by the bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis and is responsible for about 50.5 to 97.2% of the total disease-specific salmon mortality in the industry. Although SRS is also prevalent in Norway and Canada, its impact on the farmed salmon industry of those countries are less detrimental than in Chile. Based on a comprehensive literature review and a participatory priority-setting workshop with key stakeholders, we show how science-based research on SRS has evolved over time and identify 8 main research areas which should be addressed. These areas, termed epidemiology, ecology and environmental science, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, "Omics", human dimensions and vaccine development include a set of 52 specific research questions to be tackled. These research areas and specific questions need to be developed based on an integrative, collaborative and crosscutting interaction in order to be successful. A long term approach based on a research center led from within government agencies, co-financed by the salmon industry should be developed in order to foresee how research gaps must be adaptively modified in order to address the impacts of P. salmonis over the productivity of the salmon farming industry, the physical and ecological environment, and the socio-economic sustainability. This approach could result in significant gains for the environment and the industry and generate novel cross-sector alliances.

AB  - We formulate and test the hypothesis that expectations regarding changes in future income influences the WTP for environmental goods. For valuation of environmental goods in forests and other habitats in Denmark, we find that both current income and expected changes in future income are significant determinants for preferences. The effect of income on WTP seems to be caused by changes in preferences for environmental attributes rather than by marginal utility of income. The results suggest that to evaluate the distributional impacts of environmental improvements, researchers need a better measure of expected future consumption options than current income.

AB  - The structural and functional diversity of nematode communities from Pinus mugo sites in Pirin Mountain was assessed. The sampling plots represent different levels of disturbance - next to and outside ski runs. Nematode assemblages from this habitat can be characterised with high diversity (in total, 104 taxa and richness ranging from 41 to 65 genera per site). In general, the trophic structure was dominated by omnivorous and bacterial feeders coupled with low proportion of plant feeding nematodes. The high values of Maturity indices and the results from faunal analysis indicate relatively stable environment and undisturbed conditions for all sites. No clear correlation between the nematode assemblages' characteristics and the level of disturbance (position of the site in relation to ski runs) was revealed.

AB  - Bronze Age research in the eastern Baltic was actually initiated with the very first archaeological settlement excavations at Asva and Iru in Estonia and KlarAukalns in Latvia in the 1930s. Before the discovery of these hill fort sites the material culture remains were so minimal that researchers even expressed doubt concerning the existence of a proper Bronze Age or any remarkable settlement activity in this region. The quantity and quality of finds from these hill forts resulted in completely new insights into a fairly unknown cultural past of the eastern Baltic region. Quite soon the Estonian prehistorian Harry Moora reached the conclusion that the cultural life in the Early Metal Ages was against all expectations a very active and developed one, and vividly benefitting from intercultural contacts. Interestingly, Moora also stated that the rich archaeological material from these newly discovered sites indicated that the scarceness of grave and hoard finds (containing metals) need not necessarily correspond to the social and cultural reality of the past and that local deposition processes and customs should be considered. Consequently, there was no reason to believe that eastern Baltic societies suffered metal-poor or low-level economic conditions and cultural developments (see Chapter 1).
   Unfortunately, this was just a promising start of Bronze Age research that, as the entire methodology and working practice in eastern Baltic archaeology, could not be developed further. This was mainly due to the political conditions and circumstances throughout the post-World War II period and the times of the Iron Curtain. After the continuation of excavations at Asva on the Island of Saaremaa in the late 1940s and mid-1960s and other archaeological campaigns in the newly discovered site of Ridala (with palisade structures; excavated 1961-1963) in western Estonia preliminary results only and a few minor articles have been published. In his dissertation in 1970 Vello Laugas gave a detailed overview of the current state of research into the Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Estonia, also introducing the main results from earlier and his own archaeological investigations at Asva (years 1965-1966). The comprehensive account of facts leading to his chronological system and periodisation, particularly his interpretation and discussion of socio-economic processes and developments, were all grounded on archaeological objects, types and groups from Bronze Ages settlement sites. Because of remaining unpublished and the general isolation of Estonian archaeology in Soviet time Lougas' work could never be received or reviewed by any international research platform. The Bronze Age research of other Baltic Sea regions was simply denied access to the archaeological progress of the Baltic countries, also during the next decades. Laugas had a sort of autonomous position in the field of Bronze and Iron Age research in the Soviet republic of Estonia. Being practically the only academic authority specialising in and permitted to study and investigate the heritage from these prehistoric time periods, he also had to cover a large scope of other duties in salvation and heritage management. Accordingly, there was not much room and spirit left for theoretically reflective research, not to mention the danger of being steadily confronted with political ideological doctrines in Soviet archaeology and history sciences. When reflecting his (not always fully reproducible) applied methods in archaeological work and the missing data and documentations of significant archaeological sites and contexts, this background of political and economic circumstances needs to be reconsidered (Chapter 6). This concerns in particular the meteorite crater area of Kaali on Saaremaa and the archaeological excavations and the reporting under his direction (in 1976-1979), which have left some confusion and many open questions behind.
   In the late 1980s Valter Lang initiated a proper landscape and settlement archaeology in Estonia with emphasis on palaeogeography and palaeoecology, mainly in the course of studies and fieldworks in coastal areas of north Estonia (including Iru hill fort). His micro-regional and diachronic perspective on the dynamics in the interplay of humans and the environment in this region and on the introduction and development of agriculture also used to consider multidisciplinary studies of grave monuments and funerary customs. The research into stone cist graves as sources of osteoarchaeology and forensic research also helped to formulate new subject matters of social archaeology. Thus, compared to the Island of Saaremaa primarily represented by settlements in the period of study, the north Estonian research area offered a completely different but very convenient situation for developing new theories and models explaining these social and economic processes that are of significance for studies of the Asva settlement phenomenon. The archaeological evidence of land use for animal husbandry and field cultivation made researchers aware of socio-political implications of both the territorial organisation including land ownership and the technological systems behind agriculture. The emergence of a stratified agrarian society with control and ownership over the fertile lands (limestone rendzinas) and the population growth at the end of the Bronze Age as witnessed by the stone cist graves inferred to a drastically increasing social competition. According to Lang's studies, this eventually resulted in more diverse and complex relationships in society and between settlements during the Late Bronze Age. Asva and Iru, for instance, are now perceived as central places and integral in a functionalist perception of a system of interdependent open (single farms) and enclosed (complex) settlements. It is the exclusive occurrence of bronze casting workshops in settlements of hill fort type, a general eastern Baltic phenomenon, that makes the metalwork production perceived as a subject of social power-and-control institutions over supply and trade of metal (and the technology). With"the Late Bronze Age and the metalwork activity in the eastern Baltic the social and economic processes mentioned are viewed in close interaction and connection with the Nordic Bronze Age cultural sphere, with regions such as eastern Sweden and Gotland of southern Scandinavia. These processes, with Asva as a key site, are now viewed from a macro-historical center periphery perspective, situated in a Bronze Age world-system framework (Chapters 3 and 4).
   The recent studies performed by Lembi LOugas, Heidi Luik und Liina Maldre produced large amounts of new data and information on breeding strategies, the exploitation of animals and consumption patterns as well as on different social and technological aspects of craft production. Thus, the current Bronze Age research considers the Asva-type sites as key phenomena in the socio-economic developments in eastern Baltic's prehistory. This study is about completing the material culture studies and comparative analyses initiated by the aforementioned researchers (Lang et al.). In the course of the study, the archaeological groups of metalworking ceramics (moulds) and pottery emerged as illustrious 'materialised' sources of the social life and the economic activities, which allowed contributing to the discussion of the dynamics in the cultural development throughout the Bronze Age in the eastern Baltic region.
   It was the topic of metalwork production and the archaeological evidence in the Estonian Bronze Age settlement sites that offered great potential for developing and discussing the much debated problems of Bronze Age research (Chapter 7). This is first of all due to the peculiar and paradoxical scarcity of archaeologically recorded metal finds in the Bronze Age eastern Baltic, particularly in Estonia. This metal-scarce situation has traditionally been viewed in research from a metal-centred perspective and that of the metal-rich Nordic Bronze Age culture in southern Scandinavia, with countless bronze depositions in graves and hoards as obvious manifestations of social and religious acts. In the eastern Baltic only the Late Bronze Age saw a slight increase in archaeological finds related to metalwork, but hoards and graves containing bronzes remained seldom. Settlement sites of hill fort type emerged at that time, with about 25 of them revealing evidence of local bronze casting production. Since their discovery there has been no doubt about the adoption and utilisation of metalworking technology in this region; however, its impact on society and economy has been perceived fairly differently in research. While emphasis has generally been put on the social significance behind the introduction and the organisation of metalworking production (with socio-political implications of power and control), the technology aspect has been either neglected, underestimated or any advancements and skilled practice in bronze casting have been regarded as minimal However, in a kind of axiomatic way, and always ruled by the applied Nordic perspective, there has been a sort of pessimistic ('metal poor') view of the entire eastern region, namely that Bronze Age societies suffered from sporadic and poor metal supplies. In turn, the eastern Baltic has been perceived either as an economically retarded region or as socio-politically and culturally dependent on the Nordic Bronze Age sphere.
   This is where the ordering and analysing of the archaeological metalwork remains of the Estonian Bronze Age sites led to critically question this paradigmatic approach of overemphasising the socio-economic significance of metals in the study area. This also concerned the neglection of culturally regionally different depositional customs possibly distorting our image of past realities and bronze circulation. In any case, the study of a production place such as Asva leaves no doubt that metals were imported, processed and distributed (and utilised) in regular and fairly large amounts. It also became clear that the current state of research (and knowledge) does not allow yet drawing hasty conclusions about the level of technological and skilled practices in eastern Baltic metalwork. This also concerns the relationship between the bronzeworker and his environment and raises questions such as how cultural, social or religious aspects of the Bronze Age life might have affected any choices and selection of materials and resources in metal production. Thus, the material culture studies performed actually provide us with the insights necessary to assess the social significance and function of bronzes in past societies. Technological innovations as results of intercultural contact are another research issue that emerged from this material-immanent analysis and that is in need of being developed further.
   Part of Chapter 7 is dedicated to the question concerning the striking preference of casting rings (ingots?) in the eastern Baltic production places and in neighbouring regions. Because the dominance of ring-shaped clay moulds is highly visible in the casting debris it is assumed that these ring moulds might reflect an intended standardisation and commoditisation in the production and distribution of bronzes. It is furthermore assumed that the bronze rings served as multi-functional semiproducts that were commoditized valuables facilitating the exchange of agricultural products and livestock. However, as ring ingots they were of particular use and value for the metalworker, i.e. the person who was able to distinguish different material qualities in the processes of technical complexity such as alloying and melting that implied the manipulation of the metal's properties (malleability, colour, hardness, etc.). The ring object allowed easy fragmentation, division and portioning for the crucible melt, it simply fulfilled the requirements in the production process and in the distribution and exchange In practicing ring casting the settlements of Asva type seem indeed to represent a stage in the metallurgy cycle of re-melting and converting scrap bronzes and primary metals to 'ingots' in accordance with the custom and usage in the interregional metal exchange. The actual amounts of objects produced, the intensity and duration of bronze casting as well as the applied skill and expertise in metalwork technology are subject matters of further material studies.
   It has been acknowledged that in view of the economic foundations required for the import, exchange and production of metals, bronzework indeed points to a privileged or even elitist social craft activity, but not necessarily with the postulated implications of social power and control. In view of the social organisation of bronze casting the settlements of Asva and Ridala are remarkable examples of how production activities (not only metalwork) were subject to several social and economic units (households) within the settlement areas. In accordance with the various, apparently simultaneously existing production places, it appears that the major part of the community was actively involved in the complex and consuming processes of bronze casting (e.g. fabrication of moulds). It seems likely that there existed a multi-tiered organisation between the contributing craft persons, those with advanced skills and technological practice able to handle the demanding and complex melting and casting conditions such as air supply, heating procedure, determination of the melting point, etc. However, in consequence the social pattern behind metalwork craft in the Asva milieu appears to have been sort of 'democratised' and bronze casting still a matter of seasonally practised community specialisation. Asva is indeed a key site in the Bronze Age context (and beyond) when it comes to discussions of the social meaning of craft specialisation in theory and archaeological praxis, particularly because of many indications of standardisation in style, design and technique of objects, semi-products and implements related to craft and production. This concerns not only the finds related to metalwork production but also those of the bone and antler industry in the Asva milieu (see also Chapter 11).
   The Asva pottery makes up another big subject matter in the analysis of the archaeological settlement material (Chapter 8), where several morphological, technical and functional utilitarian criteria create a picture of the emergence of various coarse and fine ceramic ware and pottery types. The burnished and profiled bowls, some with handles, are distinctive of the Asva-type ceramics and enrich the range of eastern Baltic pottery groups. They also speak of an advanced technology of ceramic processing. Remarkably, the external influences highly visible in the bowls and their manufacture, design and use seem to have only affected the pottery that represents the sphere of eating and drinking customs, which quantitatively makes up only a minor part in the Asva-type pottery. The jars, food containers and/or cooking pots as the most numerous and homogeneous group (coarse ware pottery) are way less advanced in design and stylistic individuality, and also the creative effort invested in their manufacture seems somewhat restricted. The coarse ware pots, discernible by the shape of the neck and rim parts and particularly by the applied techniques of surface treatment (smoothed, striated or textile imprints) seem to be modest in terms of quality (ware, temper), but apparently sufficient for their usage. The coarse pots, constantly decorated with horizontal rows of pits pressed in neck or shoulder parts of the vessels, display a tradition of the Bronze an Early Iron Age pottery of the northeastern European forest zone and appear to have been resistant to any innovations or implementation of stylistic features. This speaks in favour of a behaviour in style and technique following strict conventions and rules, all manifesting a local pottery tradition where the jars were allowed only very restricted concessions to outside influences (rusticated surfaces, knobs, cordon applications).
   As it is likely that the fine as well as the coarse ware pottery in the settlements of Asva type was locally produced, presumably by both native potters and new arrivals in the community, the causes of this dichotomy have been discussed. First, it has been assumed that the fine ware bowls, showing distinct traits of a central European Urnfield culture milieu, that of the Late Bronze Age Lusatian tradition, might signify or express aspects of both personal use and social identity behind these dishes. The specific use of the Asva-type bowls and their possible (ritual?) contexts of utilisation have also been discussed, but it remains a subject matter to be cleared with further chemical analysis of organic residues (e.g. lipids). However, the dichotomy and exclusive application and combination of decorative elements (pit stamps or striation on jars and imprints of twisted bronze rings and burnish on bowls) were rooted in a cultural traditional disposition. These rules and conventions in regard to style and technique of ceramic work and function were perceived and communicated in the given Bronze Age society, and therefore keenly respected by the potters. That is why it has been assumed that both the persistence and the openness for innovation or implementation of foreign elements highly visible in these two ceramic groups of the Asva-type sites are the results of a collective and dualistic habitus, a phenomenon that has been described in socio-anthropological literature. Accordingly, the coarse pots and large bowls could be understood as complementary representatives of two realms: that of the inner, the domestic, and that of the outer, the public. The jars as multi-purpose vessels used for storage and preparation of food on the one hand, and the hanging and the cup-like bowls used to prepare and serve special liquids or ingredients on the other, seem to represent different spheres of closed and private household activities against 'exclusive' table and drinking manners (as open and communicative acts).
   Furthermore, the interconnection and coexistence of old and new elements in style and technique of the Asva-type pottery illustrate not only the integration of the coastal regions of western Estonia in a large interregional contact network, but also the complex ways and mechanisms in the transmission and diffusion of cultural stimuli and innovations eventually manifested in local ceramic groups (or style/culture provinces). The foreign characteristics and features on the bowls in the Asva pottery seem to be distributed in diverse and eclectic ways, with stylistic influences deriving from various geographical regions such as western and central Poland, southern and eastern Sweden and Gotland. In sum, these different, rather sporadic and changing directions of cultural influences and contacts give the Asva-type bowls an odd impression of a creolisation in style and technique. Their exclusive occurrence in the Estonian Late Bronze Age sites (Asva, Ridala, Kaali and Iru) only, while missing in Latvian and Lithuanian hill forts, and their sudden disappearance from the record with the decline of this very settlement type make them appear as evidence and symbols of social gestures.
   In the final conclusion the changes in society, economy and settlement in eastern Baltic Bronze Age have been discussed opposing the theories of the current re earch with the author's own material culture studies (Chapter 13). Places such as Asva, occurring in the Late Bronze Age on the archaeological map, do not only represent a new settlement type of permanent stationarity and centrality. Characteristic is the agrarian and maritime-based subsistence economy, complemented by various branches of secondary product processing and exclusive crafts (e.g. metalworking production). It has been asked whether the archaeologically studied settlements and the various production activities correspond to the postulates of sociopolitical relations determined by power and control based primarily on agriculture and metalwork. The Island of Saaremaa seems to reveal a slightly different, complex picture in comparison with hill forts of the eastern Baltic mainland: with Asva and complementary all-season activities, with hunting and fishing practices not only widening the range of subsistence practices. Particularly seal hunting and seasonality give reason to reassess the society relations and the settlement organisation behind this complex subsistence and craft production pattern. Both seasonality (i.e. climate and environmental aspects) and community specialisation (seal hunting strategies) need to be considered when applying theoretical concepts of hierarchisation and multi-tiered social organisation to the eastern Baltic Bronze Age cultural milieu, that is when implying chiefdom-like structures, elites or craft professionals.
   In dealing with the causes and factors of the societal change an attempt at an alternative explaination of the emergence of the Asva-type settlements against the neglected background of the role of seal hunting in Bronze Age settlement economy has been made. Accordingly, the maritime character of the studied sites on Saaremaa has been viewed from the perspective of seal exploitation as one of most eminent (marine) resources. The large percentage of seal bones among the rich osteological find material is undoubtedly a clear indicator of the extensive use and exploitation of seal products (blubber, leather). In any case, the subsistence of the Asva and Ridala hill forts was apparently not based on mixed farming and processing of secondary agrarian products alone like in the hill forts of the mainland. It seems also likely that seal populations and hunting grounds in southeastern Saaremaa (and the Gulf of Riga) have determined the location selection of the Bronze Age sites, particularly in a geographical landscape with limited, rather sporadic distribution of fertile soils (alvar or loo) for field cultivation and grazing cattle. Furthermore it has been hypothesised that settlements such as Asva and Ridala might have emerged from the fusion of conglomeratic, regionally dispersed single farms or households that might have constituted seasonal hunting sites. The merging and culmination of various economic and crafting activities and skills, the sort of communal and 'democratised' participation in exclusive crafts such as metalwork plus the versatile interregional cultural contacts and influences visible in the material culture are aspects and phenomena that could be understand from the perspective of community specialisation. Thus, the marine 'subsistence and the seasonal hunting trips to far regions in the Baltic following coastal routes could be the main determinant of the changing development in society and economy of Bronze Age Saaremaa. Not only the form of settlement organisation and the nature and complexity of social relations in community but also the character and the practice of a maritime settlement economy of Asva and its participation in the communication network of the Bronze Age Baltic Sea appear in a new light.
   This study provides a presentation, order and analysis of archaeological findings and contexts that are treated as representative, 'materialised' sources of social and economic activities and that are considered as significant for the understanding of the major cultural processes taking place in the local settlement milieu throughout the Late Bronze Age. With this material immanent approach applied to archaeological remains of an outstanding quality and informative value and in connection with current and forthcoming insights from archaeozoological and -botanical research we possibly will be able to reconstruct the basic conditions, actions and choices of Bronze Age communities when adapting to their environment. This all leads to discussing the possible causes and factors behind these societal changes primarily visible in the archaeological settlement milieu. However, in regard to the social patterns behind settlement economy and craft as well as the territorial use and perception of the surrounding landscape, many questions on the entire Estonian Bronze Age settlement phenomenon still remain to be answered.
   In any case, the Asva site has the potential of taking a key position in future Bronze Age research. The reason is the quality and spectrum of the archaeological material and the data and information available. Considering the excellent conditions of preservation of bone material, for instance, the current interdisciplinary methods of research provide a large set of applications and solutions in approaching the above-mentioned problems and subject matters of research. Some of the formulated questions and hypotheses in connection with the Bronze Age technologies and economic strategies are already subjects of current or applied research projects involving various archaeological subdisciplines (e.g. materials science, experiments, archaeobiology) and building up international research platforms. As the ongoing archaeological excavations at Asva (since 2012), in collaboration with Valter Lang and Lembi Lougas, reveal, a new stage of Bronze Age research in Estonia has already begun.

AB  - Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey data was used to supplement geotechnical investigations for a highway construction project in Norway. Heterogeneous geology throughout the survey and consequent variable bedrock threshold resistivity hindered efforts to directly track depth to bedrock, motivating us to develop an automated algorithm to extract depth to bedrock by combining both boreholes and AEM data. We developed two variations of this algorithm: one using simple Gaussian or inverse distance weighting interpolators, and another using ordinary kriging and combined probability distribution functions of input parameters.
   Evaluation shows that for preliminary surveys, significant savings in boreholes required can be made without sacrificing bedrock model accuracy. In the case study presented, we estimate data collection savings of 1000 to 10,000 NOK/km (c.$160 to $1600 USD/km) would have been possible for early phases of the investigation. However, issues with anthropogenic noise, low signal, and uncertainties in the inversion model likely reduced the comparative advantage that including AEM provided.
   AEM cannot supersede direct sampling where the model accuracy required exceed the resolution possible with the geophysical measurements. Nevertheless, with the algorithm we can identify high probability zones for shallow bedrock, identify steep or anomalous bedrock topography, and estimate the spatial variability of depth at earlier phases of investigation. Thus, we assert that our method is still useful where detailed mapping is the goal because it allows for more efficient planning of secondary phases of drilling, (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - 'Health in All Policies' (HiAP) is defined as a 'horizontal, complementary policy-related strategy with a high potential for contributing to population health'. To ensure that health impacts are highlighted across sectors, the support of actors in different sectors, not just the health sector, is needed. Public health, here defined as a universally important but a low prioritized politics area, needs to involve high politics areas to fulfil the HiAP strategy. This study aimed to analyse the agenda setting, formulation, initiation and implementation of the intersectoral public health policy and one tool of HiAP, health impact assessment (HIA), at the national and local level (exemplified by Stockholm County) in Sweden. A literature search was carried out of scientific and grey literature on intersectoral health policy and HIA in Sweden. The study was a policy analysis, using a content analysis method, and the theoretical framework of Kingdon where the results were examined through problem identification (why a window of opportunity opens for an intersectoral health policy and HIA), the factors and impact of politics (support for the formulation and implementation of policy) and policy (how best to solve the problem). The results showed that actors perceived the problems (the rationale) differently depending on their agenda and interest. Politicians and experts had a high impact on the formulation of the policy, agreeing on the policy goals. However, there was little focus on implementation plans implying that the political actors were not in agreement, and the experts sometimes showing conflicting evidence-based opinions on how to best ensure the policy. Without this in place, it is difficult to involve high politics areas, and vice versa, without the involvement of high politics, it is difficult to achieve the policy. However, this is a long-term process, where small steps need to be taken, leaving the policy window half-shut.

AB  - This paper describes the LOVE (LOcal Vegetation Estimates) model for estimating local vegetation composition within the relevant source area of pollen. This model quantifies and then subtracts background pollen tie, pollen coming from beyond the relevant source area) in order to arrive at a quantitative reconstruction of local vegetation. Parameters required for LOVE applications are pollen counts from target sites, the relevant source area of pollen of these sites, pollen productivity estimates and regional vegetation composition within 10(4)-10(5) km(2). Regional vegetation composition is obtained using fossil pollen from large sites (>= 10(2) ha) with the REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites) model, the first step of the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) specifically designed for LOVE applications. POLLSCAPE simulations demonstrate that (1) regional vegetation composition can be used to predict background pollen at and beyond the relevant source area of pollen for given-sized basins, (2) LOVE with the LRA framework provides a robust and accurate estimate of local vegetation composition much better than vegetation reconstruction using pollen percentages alone and (3) although the relevant source area of pollen is difficult to estimate particularly in past landscapes, a proposed method using backward modelling of LOVE is effective to estimate the relevant source area in landscapes of unknown vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity. Thus, the LRA will also be useful to estimate indirectly changes in spatial structure of past vegetation and landscape caused by natural and anthropogenic forcing.

AB  - This paper investigates sustainability in retailing based on three different perspectives: i) the overall corporate management, ii) the development of an attractive product range, iii) the daily in-store management and activities. The purpose is to identify a set of main themes for each perspective, investigate contradictions and areas of conflict, and discuss how to bridge the perspectives. A qualitative case study approach is applied investigating the global retailer IKEA. The study includes Sweden, Germany and the UK. The research showed that the corporate, product and store perspectives are complementary but also involve contradictions and barriers to giving a higher priority to sustainability. These concern the time perspective, the set of stakeholders considered and the overall priority. Developing goals and benefits linked to sustainability, using effective arenas for interactions and linking sustainability to the legend and culture are suggested as three bridges that may overcome the contradictions.

AB  - Economic subsidies continue to be in focus as potentially important drivers of agricultural change. Their exact functioning as drivers in very complex systems are not all that well analysed or documented however, and their effect e.g. in terms of environmental output are currently being questioned. In the work reported here, we focus on how the regionality of the farming system may influence the potential effect of agricultural subsidies, also in terms of farmland abandonment. We do this through using multiple linear regressions (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) on the Norwegian database on agricultural production data, combined with farm location data. Our findings demonstrate how the outcome of certain support systems may differ between regions, and how a region may dominate national statistic. We conclude that as subsidies continue to be a key tool in achieving agricultural policy aims, we need a better understanding of how the subsidy systems work. To understand the impact of a change in subsidy it is necessary to consider the local context in which it operates, e.g. demographics, bio-physical resources and feasibility of land rental. Spatial data and techniques such as spatial MLR and GWR are increasingly accessible to policy makers and should be used to provide insight into the local impacts of current policy. However this understanding must also emphasize farmer motivation and decision making and these investigations must be regionally based. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - British Architecture 1945-1965
AB  - The abstract, white architecture of the inter-war British avant garde comes to a decisive end with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. As a result the postwar period emerges somewhat divided as to what should become the new architecture of the moment with which to accommodate the needs and express the values of a newly progressive society. Although the allocation of certain stylistic tropes to different, socio-cultural situations was not so categorical as in the pre-war totalitarian societies, there were nonetheless comparable semantic inflections in British architecture over the twenty-year period which followed the end of the war. This is perhaps first evident in the prefabricated, lightweight modular building systems adopted for both emergency housing and school building; respectibely, for the accommodation of the bombed out population in the first instance and for the production of some 2500 schools in the second, most of which were built over the fifteen years between 1945 and 1960 as a consequence of the Education Act, put in place by the socialist government in 1946. Emergency housing needs were met by the minimalist, single story, prefabricated Portal house which was extensively built on vacant sites in major cities after the end of the war. The equally modular, prefabricated school system developed by the Ministry of Education came into being initially through the architect's department of the Hertfordshire County Council, under the direction of C. H. Aslin. In both instances what one effectively encountered was a lightweight, steel panel system, bereft of any recognizable iconography apart from the fact the internal walls of the schools were finished in primary colors and were furnished with stackable Scandinavian wood and metal furniture plus indoor plants; the whole often being set in diminutive picturesque landscape.
   However this modular lingua franca could not be extended to the domestic environment. Here the heritage of the Garden City movement, dating back to the turn of the century, was pressed into service in a discretely modified form to constitute the two-story housing stock that made up the bulk of the residential fabric in the fourteen new towns established by the Labor government after the War as a result of the New Towns Act of 1948. This accounts for the single and semi-detached houses that became the vehicle so to speak, to which the so-called 'peoples detailing' was to be applied. This last comprised a repertoire of shallow-pitched, tile roofs, load-bearing, cavity walls in brick, along with casement opening lights and fixed picture windows in either steel or wood, which were invariably painted white. This amiable, unchallenging, anti-street, garden city aesthetic accessed through winding roads invariably engendered a somewhat informal site layout which, together with the detailing, came under the rubric of 'contemporary' as opposed to the received prewar idea of a severely abstract modern architecture. This conciliatory everyday style was favored by the left-wing architects of the London County Council who occupied mid-level positions within this 300 man architects department. I have in mind such figures as Oliver Cox and Graham Shank land both of whom were very influenced by the socially democratic architecture of the Swedish Welfare State. However this low-rise heimatstil principle of 'people's detailing' would be modified in the case of high-rise housing since flat roofs were deemed to be more appropriate for the capping of such forms. As it happens the preferred high-rise type was also of Swedish origin; namely, a 10-story tower block with a square footprint and a central access core, serving four apartments per floor, as this type occupy a large sector of the LCC Roehampton Estate dating from 1958.
   The influence of local authorities at this time was very pervasive given that almost half of the registered architects in the country were employed by local governments and the remainder who were in private practice received most of their commissions from the same source. As Reyner Banham would observe in his canonical study The New Brutalism of 1966, Cox and Shank land had close personal contacts with Sweden at the time, moreover as he reveals the term 'brutalist' originated as a qualifying adjective in Sweden. Banham cites a letter from 1956 written by Hans Asplund to Eric de Mare of The Architectural Review.
   In January 1950 I shared offices with my esteemed colleagues Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm. These architects were at the time designing a house at Uppsala. Judging from their drawings I called them in a mildly sarcastic way 'Neo-Brutalists'. (The Swedish word for 'New Brutalists'!) The following summer, at jollification with some English friends, among whom were Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox and Graeme Shank land, the term was mentioned again in a jocular fashion. When I visited the same friends in London last year, they told me that they had brought the word back with them to England, and that it had spread like wildfire, and that it had, somewhat astoundingly, been adopted by a certain faction of younger English architects.
   It is hard to imagine something more ironic than that the categorically anti-Swedish British Brutalist line should have at least part of its origin as a style in Sweden itself.
   Despite the eclipse of the abstract British "international style" a certain vestige of a pre-war Neo-Corbusian syntax was carried over into the postwar period, most notably in the work of Lubetkin and Tecton, particularly as this applied to the rather formalistic medium-rise apartment blocks that the firm designed for the East End of London between 1945 and 1955. Typified by their Spa Green Estate built in Finsbury in 1956, this ornamental manner could hardly be more removed from the aforementioned 'peoples detailing'. The Tecton slab blocks were invariably animated by syncopated faience screens running across the balconied face of each block. Lubetkin's syntax was also evident in the plan articulation and detailing of the Royal Festival Hall realized under the direction of Leslie Martin who was then chief architect of the LCC and designed by Peter Moro who had worked for Tecton prior to the Second World War.
   A second figure, from the prewar era, was David du R. Aberdeen, who also seems to have cultivated a 'baroque' Neo-Corbusian manner as we find this elaborated in his Trades Union Headquarters built near Bedford Square in 1951 and faced in polished stone. This New Monumentality apres la lettre could hardly be made to jibe with the pitched roof populism of the New Town vernacular or with the lightweight modular manner of the prefabricated schools.
   In many respects 1951 is the annus mirabilis of postwar recovery as far as British architecture is concerned, for this not only sees the realization of the Festival of Britain and the Royal Festival Hall, but also the Coventry Cathedral Competition for which Alison and Peter Smithson submitted a totally radical shell concrete form encompassing the entire plan of a diamond ecclesiastical space.
   It is clear that the inspiration behind the Festival of Britain was the social democratic Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 which under the direction of the architect Gunnar Asplund and the critical intellectual Gregor Paulson would effectively inaugurate a new egalitarian middle class culture, closely linked fields of architecture and industrial design. As far as the propagation of popular good taste was concerned the Festival of Britain followed Stockholm to the letter with its playful tubular metal chairs, in primary colors designed by Ernest Race and the popular slogan of Black Eyes and Lemonade which summed up the playful spirit of the occasion. Like Stockholm, the Festival conveyed a mixed message as far as received taste in architecture was concerned in as much as both exhibitions celebrated Constructivist architecture as a built manifestation of a newly emergent techno-scientific society. I have in mind in the case of Stockholm Asplund's stressed skin control cabin elevated on stilts and capped by a latticework publicity mast while the parallel engineering rhetoric in the Festival was patently the Skylon; a latticework, cigar-shaped pylon stayed by wire cables designed by Powell and Moya in collaboration with the engineer Felix Samuely equally dematerialized stressed-skin dome of the Dome of Discovery by Ralph Tubbs supported at its rim by steel latticework struts as a kind of tethered flying saucer. Overall however what Alvar Aalto wrote about the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930 could have been applied just as easily to the Festival of Britain twenty years later, to the effect that:
   . . . This is not a composition of glass, stone and steel, as a visitor who despises functionalism might imagine; it is a composition of houses, flags, floodlights, flowers, fireworks, happy people and clean table cloths.
   Be this as it may, a discernible schism emerged not only between the left wing 'peoples detailing' of the low-rise domestic architecture such as find in Frederick Gibberd's Harlow New Town, but also between those who would look to pure engineering technique as the source for a new unprecedented tectonic language as this is attempted in the shell concrete Brynmawr Rubber Factory designed by the Architect's Co-partnership in 1952 in collaboration with the engineer Ove Arup. The main alternative was to look for an authentic form of expression in the street culture of the then still extant British working class. This split is already discernible in the early work of Alison and Peter Smithson which served to oscillate between heroic engineering form on the one hand as we find this in the competition entries for their Neo-Miesian Hunstanton School Norfolk of 1949 and their Nervi-like Coventry Cathedral of 1951 and, on the other, the as found sociological 'otherness' of the nineteenth century two-story worker's row housing which, comprised of brick walls and slate roofs, made up the fabric and provided the setting for everyday life in the Bye Law streets of Bethnal Green. The Smithsons first experienced this culture through visiting the Bethnal Green home of Nigel and Judith Henderson; the one a photographer and the other a sociologist and where the one captured the street life of the arena on film, the other studied its kinship structure. The Lore and Language of School Children published in 1959 by the sociologists lona and Peter Opie documented the role played by the culture of the street in the evolution of this society.
   That Henderson and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi were crucial to the evolution of the sensibility of the Smithsons would be borne out by the patio and pavilion which made up their joint contribution to the seminal White Chapel Gallery exhibition This is Tomorrow of 1956. This 'anti-consumerist' reworking of the Abbe Langier's primitive hut plus a double spread image of all four of them incongruously seated in the middle of Limmerson Street in London, running across the spiral binding of the catalogue, eloquently summed up their l'art brut approach. This ethos was reinforced by a poetic inscription in 'child-like' script asserting the anti-idealistic ethnographic archaism of the content.
   Patio & pavilion represents the fundamental necessities of the human habitat in a series of symbols. The first necessity is for a piece of the world the patio; the second necessity is for an enclosed space the pavilion. These two spaces are furnished with symbols for all human needs. The head for man himself his brain and his machines. The tree for nature. The rocks and natural objects for stability and the decoration of man-made space. The light box for the hearth and family. Artifacts and pin ups for his irrational urges. The frog and the dog for the other animals. The wheel and aeroplane for locomotion and the machine.
   Although James Stirling and the Smithsons would rival each other throughout the trajectory of their separate careers it is of the utmost significance as far as Brutalism is concerned that they would both cultivate a 'smokestack' aesthetic in their varied iterations of a native brick vernacular irrespective of whether the location was urban and rural. This mutual sensibility surely accounts for the similarity between a number of 'degree zero' works projected and realized by these separate practices during the first half of the 50's. I have in mind as far as the Smithsons are concerned the small warehouse-like four-story infill terrace house in brick and concrete projected for the Soho area of London in 1952. Of this work they wrote: "had this been built, it would have been the first exponent of 'the new brutalism' in England".
   And equally primitive syncopated exercise in load-bearing brickwork also characterizes the remarkable housing projects realized by Stirling and Gowan in 1955 and 1957; respectively, their 3-story Ham Common flats built on a verdant site in Richmond in 1955 and the 3 to 4 story terrace housing built as a fragmented block in Preston, Lancashire in 1957. The overall cultural intention informing the latter sets forth even more explicitly than any text by the Smithsons the common sensibility of the moment as far as their mutual essays in low-rise, low-cost housing was concerned. Thus we read:
   In 19th century industrial 'by-law' towns you pass perhaps twenty or more front doors before coming to your own, with children playing in the roads, parents chatting on the pavement and sitting in doorways, and the old peering through windows. This horizontal approach through the neighborhood to get to your house seems to be a reason for the friendliness and sense of community which exists in these work towns and the 19th century solution seems more dynamic than the latter planning solutions for urban mass housing . . .
   In the initial oeuvre complete published in 1975, Stirling and Gowan make it clear that this 'nostalgia for the slums' was a broad postwar British sensibility that extended well beyond architecture and could be found in artists as diverse as the novelist Somerset Maughan, the painter L.S. Lowry and George Orwell for his 1945 working class epic On the Road to Wigan Pier. This was also the environment that the Smithsons wished to evoke in their 10-story 'street-in-the-air' Golden Lane Housing competition entry of 1952, the span-deck access of which would be realized at a more exposed scale in the Parkhill Housing built to the designs of Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith for the Sheffield City Council in 1961. This achievement proved at a larger, more windswept scale, the truth of the cryptically critical observation that: "above the 6th floor it can be accepted that the old forms of contact with the ground are no longer valid".
   This mutual nostalgia for a declining 'vernacular' would also have its rural version in the work of both of these practices in the early 50's as we may judge from Stirling's village infill housing prototype exhibited at the CLAM X congress at Aix-en-Provence in 1953 which was inspired by Thomas Sharp's 1945 study The English Village. A more or less identical theme expressly designed for the same occasion made up the substance of the Smithsons' 'fold houses' ostensibly designed for West Burton in Yorkshire of which they wrote in Uppercase 3 of 1955.
   The new is placed over the old like a new plant growing through old branches -or new fruit on old twigs. The fold is a windbreak. Each house has its back to the prevailing wind. Instead of the 'housing Manual' type of house, sent down from the suburbs -a barrow boy on the fells.
   Sixty years later the oblique references in this statement may be easily missed (i.e. the contempt of the authors for the bureaucratic imposition of petit bourgeois) for what is conjoined in their predilection for 'barrow bow' street culture as a means for revitalizing the existing rural vernacular of the Yorkshire hills.
   In a resume of the "Parallel Life and Art" exhibition staged by the Smithsons, Paolozzi, and Henderson at the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London in 1953, the Smithsons openly acknowledge how both themselves and Stirling & Gowan were equally involved with the so-called 'brutalist' ideology emerging out of the Independent Group that met at the ICA in the early 50's, comprising such figures as Reyner Banham, Theo Crosby, Colin St John Wilson, Richard Hamilton and Laurence Alloway, this last being the critic/curator of the exhibition This is Tomorrow. Two canonical buildings of the mid 60's respectively already suggest how these two practices will evolve from their mutual beginnings over the next decade as we may judge from the Smithsons' Economist Building realized in St James Street, London in 1963 and Stirling and Gowan's Engineering Faculty Building, Leicester University completed in 1964. Although both buildings comprise medium-rise towers with The Economist topping out at 17 stories and Leicester rising for 11 floors, the first inserted into dense urban fabric is unequivocally Sittesque and Neo-Miesian in character, while the second is a free-standing, Neo-Constructivist work. By this date quite different positions seem to have been established with the Smithsons opting for modular tectonic pieces having latent classical affinities and Stirling going for more strenuously organic assemblies with partial references to Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto, with last affinity coming more fully into its own with Stirling's dormitories for St. Andrew's University in Scotland also realized in the 60's. The British 19th century engineering tradition is present as a key expressive element as far as the Leicester Engineering Building is concerned (shades of the Crystal Palace and Brunel) while in St. Andrews while we are witness to a concrete and glass essay surprisingly reminiscent of the Smithsons in their Sheffield University competition entry of 1953. At the same time there are faint traces of the Gothic Revival evident in both Leicester and The Economist. In the first instance, on Stirling's own admission, Leicester makes an allusion to William Butterfield's All Saints Margaret Street, London of 184959, while in the case of the Economist Gothic is latent in the structural mullions of the building which step back like attenuated buttresses in order to express the diminution of the load as they rise upwards as in the stepped piers of Mies van de Rohe's Promontory Apartments of 1949.
   As opposed to The Economist which, as fate would have it, brought the Smithsons' building career to a virtual close in terms of achieving works of comparable status and size, the Leicester Engineering Building gave Stirling and Gowan a run of university commissions culminating in leading to what has more recently recognized as the Red Trilogy on account of the fact that they were all faced in red brick and tile, namely in sequence after Leicester the History Faculty Building at Cambridge University (1964) and the Florey Dormitory at Queen's College, Oxford (1966). All of these major works by the Smithsons and Stirling involved the creative participation of the brilliant structural engineers Ron Jenkins of Ove Arup and Partners in the case the Hunstanton School in Norfolk of 1949-54, and Frank Newby of Felix Samuely and Partners in the case of the Red Trilogy and St Andrews University.
   With the appointment of Leslie Martin to the professorship of architecture at Cambridge University in 1956the creative patronage of the 'brutalist' sensibility shifted from London to Cambridge and with this change in leadership and focus the so-called movement entered its maturity. However before turning to the exceptionally fertile studio set up in Cambridge by Martin and Colin St. John it is necessary to comment in passing on the importance of certain training offices on the London scene in the 50's and the 60's above all the practice of Lyons Israel and Ellis which served as a proving ground for the next generation, namely, John Miller and Neave Brown, both of whom worked closely with Tom Ellis; in the first instance on an annex to the Old Vic Theatre (1958) and in the second on a stacked lecture theatres in fair-faced, reinforced (white) concrete, for the Wolfson Institute at Hammersmith Hospital (1961). Patrick Hodgkinson was the third architect of exceptional talent from the same year at the AA School. As it happens Hodgkinson would play a seminal role in the development of a normative modern Aaltoesque brick aesthetic appropriate to the British climate as this would issue from the Martin/St. Wilson Studio from 1956 onwards; most notably in terms of Hodgkinson's direct involvement, load bearing brick 3-story terrace housing projected for St. Pancras, London in 1959 and the student hostel for Caius College, dating from 1962. That Hodgkinson was the decisive behind these works is testified to by the house in Burrel's Field, Cambridge that Hodgkinson realized for the retiring master of Trinity College, Lord Adrian, in 1964. Hodgkinson would assert his ultimate prowess as an independent architect with his monumental urban set-piece known as the Brunswick Centre under development and re-development between 1965 and 1973.
   It is possible to argue that the Brunswick Centre is an ultimate Neo-Brutalist work at an urban scale since executed throughout in beton brut establishes itself as a city-in-miniature, that is as a micro-cosmic city with the city, one which breaks totally within the traditional Georgian square and street patter by which it is confronted on the Marchmont Street side. It has the problematic character of being conceived in section rather than in plan in as much as it comprises two stepped five-story housing blocks facing each other across a central promenade axis, flanked with shops throughout its length plus a cinema at the point of a monumental transverse axis lead to a nearby park.
   Like Hodgkinson Miller was also working in the Martin/St. John Wilson in Cambridge before opening up his own practice with Alan Colquhoun in 1960 with a commission to design a secondary school in Stratford in East London which is completed in 1964. Like Caius College, it is significant that this two story, load-bearing structure occupies a perfect square in plan from into which voids are 'excavated' as it were in order to produce the figure of the school which in its turn is wrapped a central square double-height assembly hall.
   It is obvious in retrospect that the plan of this school is closely related to the interlocking square top-lit reading rooms that Martin and St. John Wilson designed for the new Oxford University library complex under construction from 1959 to 1979. It is possibly fair to say that that the British 'neo-brutalist' sensibility much influenced by Aalto plays itself out in the work of Martin and his colleagues, throughout the 70's in what was one final effort to create a normative modern architecture for the British Isles to be executed primarily in brick.

AB  - The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), together with The Energy and Resources Institute of India (TERI), contributed to the European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions, EU-CAARI, by conducting aerosol measurements in Gual Pahari, India, from December 2007 to January 2010. This paper describes the station setup in detail for the first time and provides results from the aerosol in-situ measurements, which include PM and BCe masses, aerosol size distribution from 4 nm to 10 mu m, and the scattering and absorption coefficients. The seasonal variation of the aerosol characteristics was very distinct in Gual Pahari. The highest concentrations were observed during the winter and the lowest during the rainy season. The average PM10 concentration (at STP conditions) was 216 mu gm(-3) and the average PM2.5 concentration was 126 mu gm(-3). A high percentage (4-9%) of the PM10 mass consisted of BCe which indicates anthropogenic influence. The percentage of BCe was higher during the winter; and according to the diurnal pattern of the BCe fraction, the peak occurred during active traffic hours. Another important source of aerosol particles in the area was new particle formation. The nucleated particles grew rapidly reaching the Aitken and accumulation mode size, thus contributing considerably to the aerosol load. The rainy season decreased the average fraction of particle mass in the PM2.5 size range, i.e. of secondary origin. The other mechanism decreasing the surface concentrations was based on convective mixing and boundary layer evolution. This diluted the aerosol when sun radiation and the temperature was high, i.e. especially during the pre-monsoon day time. The lighter and smaller particles were more effectively diluted.

AB  - Transition towards a low-carbon transport sector fundamentally depends on decarbonization of the passenger car fleet. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the driving factors behind decreasing CO2 emissions of new passenger cars. This paper develops a new decomposition method to break down the change in the average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars into components representing changes in available technology, carbon efficiency of consumer choices, vehicle attributes, fuel mix, and the gap between type-approval and on-road CO2 emissions of passenger cars. Our decomposition draws insights from the traditional index decomposition analysis and frontier-based decomposition of productivity growth. It satisfies such desirable properties as factor reversal, time reversal, and zero-value robustness. An empirical application to a unique data set that covers all registered passenger cars in Finland sheds light on why and how the CO2 emissions of new cars decreased from year 2002 to year 2014.

AB  - Since the 1970s, the world has witnessed a proliferation of international treaties championing the protection of wildlife. The effectiveness of those treaties, which together comprise international wildlife law (IWL), depends on their national implementation by individual states rather than on their number. National implementation of IWL ranges from legislative action, to resource allocation, to individual behavioural change. Inadequate IWL implementation can facilitate and even lead to wildlife crime. Therefore, examining how countries operationalise their commitments derived from IWL is important to understand the efficacy (or lack thereof) of wildlife treaties. The main goal of this article is to investigate the dynamics by which nations internalise international wildlife commitments into state law, by using Norway as a case study. The article thus explores the social dynamics that shaped the domestic legal action that Norway undertook after its ratification of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention). The study is based on historical data documenting Norway's legislative processes derived from the conventions and historical records of the country's environmental conflicts. It applies Chambliss's sociology of law perspective on conflict to interpret the material. While many globalisation scholars hold that globalisation stripped states of legislative sovereignty, this article argues that Norway's wildlife policy is mostly dependent on clashes between national forces, rather than Norway conceding legislative powers to the international community. In other words, the tension between economic growth and ecosystem conservation determines how Norway implements IWL commitments. This article contributes to the literature on environmental regime effectiveness and the domestic impact of treaties.

AB  - In boreal forests, the level of naturalness and the stage of succession explain most of the variation in forest structure within a particular forest type. Thus, these two factors should also have a major effect on species assemblages in forests, at least on species groups associated with wood. The present study is the first attempt to analyze empirically the simultaneous effects of forest succession and naturalness on wood-inhabiting fungi, a taxonomic group of special ecological importance. The study area was situated in eastern Finland, middle boreal zone. A total of 41 study plots were established in Pinus sylvestris forests representing three levels of forest naturalness: natural, seminatural and intensively managed forests. Five stages of succession were distinguished according to the age of the dominating tree layer (< 10, 40, 70, 110, and > 150 yr old), except in managed forests where only four stages were available. A total of 5328 records of 195 species of fungi were made. The first, open stage of succession was clearly the most species-rich period of succession in all levels of forest naturalness. In natural and seminatural forests, the first stage of succession was also very distinctive in its fungal composition, and thus of special value in protecting biodiversity in boreal forests. In the succession following the first stage, the level of naturalness had more effect on assemblages of fungi than did the stage of succession. Intensive forest management affects threatened species particularly. In conclusion, natural young stages of succession should also be included in the network of boreal forest reserves.

AB  - This article reviews the evolution of the North Atlantic Marine Mammals Commission (NAMMCO) and considers its relations with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and other international institutions concerned with marine resource management. Starting out in 1988 with a conference to address their common concerns, the four parties of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway in 1990 set up a North Atlantic Committee for Coordination of Marine Mammals Research (NAC), thereby institutionalizing the information function crucial to management. The regulation function was attended to when NAMMCO was established with a scientific committee and a council in 1992. With a management committee and the scientific committee being operative in 1993, the regime appears to have been steadily evolving towards a prominent role in North Atlantic marine mammals management. The preservationist inclination of most IWC members is identified as a major driving force, but also important are the development of a multispecies perspective in fisheries science and the coastal states' fear of creeping jurisdiction on the part of an international organization. Problems of compatibility with the IWC are found to be minor at this stage, while NAMMCO rests firmly on the legal bases provided by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention and the Agenda 21 adopted by UNCED in 1992. The real threats to marine mammals are impacts from pollution, seismic survey shooting, and nuclear test explosions, rather than harvest. A relevant future policy area for the IWC is therefore the task of informing its member governments of the effects of environmental degradation on whales, while the management issues could be shifted to appropriate regional organizations that can manage whales on a sustainable basis in relation to their role in the ecosystem.

AB  - Energy use is one of the key indicators for developing more sustainable agricultural practices. For this reason, energy use in the production of conventional and organic milk and rye bread in Finland was studied by conducting a life cycle inventory (LCI). The product systems of milk and rye bread consisted of farming, production of fuels, electricity and fertilisers, as well as the processing phases of milk and bread, i.e. the dairy and the bakery. Transportation of fuels, raw materials and the final products was also taken into account. Primary energy consumption was 6.4 GJ in average conventional milk production and 4.4 GJ in average organic milk production, calculated per 1000 1 of milk. For rye bread the values were 15.3 GJ (conventional) and 13.3 GJ (organic) per 1000 kg of rye bread. The proportion of renewable energy in the product systems studied,varied between 7 and 16% of the total primary energy use, being somewhat higher in organic production. In milk production, energy use efficiency can be increased, by favouring organic production. Making changes in the energy use patterns of bakeries would be the fastest way to affect the energy profile of bread, because bakery is responsible for 70 and 80% of the total energy consumption in conventional and organic bread production, respectively.

AB  - This article is aimed at exploring the relationship between physical asset management (PAM) practices and sustainability performance. A framework of interrelated constructs was developed based on the existing literature and consequently tested through empirical study. Survey data were collected from organizations operating in six European countries (i.e., Greece, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Turkey) and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM). The results offer support for the proposed hypotheses, showing that PAM practices positively influence the sustainability performance outcomes, namely economic, environmental, and employee-related social performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that a PAM framework can be conceptualized by four sub-constructs, namely physical asset risk management, physical asset performance assessment, physical asset lifecycle management, and physical asset policy and strategy. Finally, this study brings to light some theoretical and managerial implications as well as directions for future research. The findings of the study underscore PAM areas in which managers should focus on in order to optimize costs, performance, and risk exposures concerning the physical assets, and therefore enhance sustainability performance.

AB  - Increased knowledge about how lichen colonization responds to logging is a prerequisite for developing guidelines in forest management aimed to maintain biodiversity. Within an experimentally logged boreal spruce forest we studied effects of different logging strategies and distance to the forest edges on colonization of epiphytic chlorolichens. Within a fine-grained (23 clearcuts, 0.2 ha each) and a coarse-grained area (3 clearcuts, 2.25 ha each) we sampled 90 branches. In addition 20 branches were sampled in an untouched control area. The 15 youngest annual shoots along the main axes on each branch were analyzed.
   Establishment of the dispersed diaspores, most of them Hypogymnia, was mainly limited to shoot ages 4-6 where the needles also were present. Independent of logging strategy the occurrence of small lobules increased with increasing distance from the edges, indicating unfavorable conditions for establishment at the edges or a lower supply of diaspores. A distinct decrease in the number of thalli of Cavernularia hultenii was observed in the two logged areas compared to the control branches. The colonization of Hypogymnia spp. and Platismatia spp. was successful in the fine-grained area, while a coarse-grained pattern of logging caused a significant decrease in the number of thalli, from shoot age 5 for Hypogymnia and shoot age 9 for Platismatia. An early drop of needles in the coarse-grained area, especially at the forest edges, supports the assumption that the occurrence of needles is important for a successful colonization. A higher rate of growth of these species in the coarse-grained area, compared to the other two areas, illustrates that logging does not necessarily cause unfavorable conditions for growth of already established thalli.
   In conclusion, establishment of the diaspores is less successful in logged areas. Thus, a fragmented logging pattern influences the colonization negatively, even for common chlorolichens. Moreover, the response to logging strategy is species-specific. Development of management guidelines should be based on wide scientific knowledge about the species life-history characteristics.

AB  - Agricultural intensification in Europe has affected farmland bird populations negatively, both during summer and winter. Although the migratory period poses separate challenges on birds than breeding and wintering, the consequences of farming practices for birds during migration remain poorly investigated. We monitored abundance and species richness of migratory birds in autumn at matched pairs of organic and conventional farms situated either in intensively farmed open plains (homogeneous landscapes) or in small-scale farming landscapes (heterogeneous landscapes) in southern Sweden. Total bird density did not differ between landscape types but was marginally higher on organic compared to conventional farms. When including taxonomic status in the model (passerines vs non-passerines), we found significantly more birds on organic farms, and more non-passerines in the homogeneous landscapes. The effect of farming practice and landscape type on density differed between functional groups. Omnivore density was higher in the homogeneous landscapes, and invertebrate feeders were marginally more abundant on organic farms. The effects of farming practice on the overall species richness and on the density of granivorous birds were landscape dependent. In the homogeneous landscapes, organic farms held a higher number of species and density of granivorous birds than conventional farms, but there was no such difference in the heterogeneous landscapes. Thus, organic farming can enhance abundance and species richness of farmland birds during migration, but the effect differs between landscape types and species. The effectiveness of organic farming was highest in the homogeneous landscape making it important to promote organic farming there. However, for some species during migration, increased heterogeneity in homogeneous landscapes may have negative effects. We propose that migratory bird diversity in homogeneous landscapes may be best preserved by keeping the landscape open, but that a reduced agricultural intensity, such as organic farming, should be encouraged.

AB  - For many years, I believed that fieldwork is primarily about systematic data collection. Only gradually did I begin to understand that fieldwork has several other, equally meaningful dimensions to it. This essay reflects on archaeological and anthropological fieldwork as inspiration and as a kind of a meditative (or a broadly spiritual) practice that, a little like 'altered states of consciousness', affords discovering and becoming aware of interconnections between and entanglements of myriad things and phenomena in the world. This approach implies and resonates with landscapes and lived worlds in the High North, such as the Gilbbesjavri (Fi. Kilpisjarvi) region where we conducted fieldwork in 2020, that are characterized by relational animistic-shamanistic ideas of and engagements with reality. In this essay, I discuss two sites - an old Sami dwelling site and an unexpected piece of environmental art - in relation to interconnections between, and overlapping of, different worlds. I engage with other worldliness in the landscape and dialogue between the European far North and the Mediterranean, as prompted by the said key loci, and how these enable seeing and experiencing landscapes in a new manner.

AB  - In a landscape with patchily distributed forage resources, an animal's distribution may reflect the distribution of the resources if the population is forage-limited in time or space. This may be particularly explicit in climatically extreme and seasonally variable environments, notably alpine and polar environments during winter. Sustainable management considers the amount of available alpine ground lichen in winter as a predictor of carrying capacity for the last remaining populations of wild European Mountain reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus in alpine environments in South Norway. Ground lichen growth is constrained to elevated, wind-blown, snow-free ridges. However, wild Mountain reindeer also persist in areas providing little lichen resources. Our alternative functional hypothesis is that the critical resource is the amount of snow-free feeding areas during winter, which provide direct access to forage, likely to be energy-profitable regardless of the type of vegetation. We sampled animal-borne videos from wild Mountain reindeer during maximum accumulation of snow in late winter/spring, in three contrasting areas providing variable amounts of ground lichen and alternative vegetation resources. Direct observations of reindeer foraging via videos document an active selection and strong preference for feeding on snow-free patches, regardless of type of vegetation. Active 'cratering' in snow was not observed. In contrast, walking behaviours occurred much more frequently across snow-covered areas. Remote sensing data and analyses corroborated these observations. In the sustainable management of wild Mountain reindeer amounts of vegetated snow-free areas is an important functional predictor of winter carrying capacity.

AB  - Modern pollen deposition in and around woodland fragments in a largely open cultural landscape in northwest Scotland is investigated using moss polsters and surface sediment samples from small lakes. The percentage of local arboreal (tree and shrub) pollen types declines rapidly with distance from the woodland edge, generally reaching background levels in less than 100 m. Even at the woodland edge or under the canopy, some samples contain less than 30% local arboreal pollen. The relationship between percentage of local arboreal pollen and distance from the woodland edge does not Gary with changing topographic relationship between sample location and the,woodland edge, but does differ according to the vegetation community outside the woodland. Comparison of pollen assemblages from 11 small take basins (mean size 1.0 hectare) with assemblages from moss polsters collected near the lake edge suggests that the pollen source area for arboreal pollen types is in the order of 300 m for peat samples and over 400 m for lake sediments. Implications for interpretation of palaeorecords are considered.

AB  - Sustainable forest management implies successful regeneration following disturbances. Tree regeneration in subarctic ecosystems can, however, be constrained by limitations to seedling establishment related to cold soils, slow decomposition rates, and competition by ericaceous species. We established a field trial at the northern limit of commercial forests in Quebec, Canada, to evaluate to what extent mechanical site preparation (MSP) and planting of a nurse N-2-fixing species could promote conifer establishment on a site burned in 2007. The experiment comprised four treatments applied in 2010: standard MSP (disc trenching), standard MSP plus planting of Alnus crispa, intensive MSP, with larger furrows than standard MSP, and a control. Main plots were divided and planted in 2011 with Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Stearns & Poggenb. or Pinus banksiana Lamb. We monitored seedling survival, growth, nutrition, and microsite over a 3-year period. Results revealed interactions between treatments and planted species. Mechanical site preparation resulted in higher conifer growth relative to the control conditions, and planting Alnus resulted in growth gains similar to those obtained from intensive MSP. We measured competitive interactions between Alnus and the conifers that might eventually cancel out the initial benefits derived from facilitation by planting the nurse species. Longer term monitoring of interspecific interactions is needed to unravel the mechanisms responsible for the facilitative effect and identify the best management practices.

AB  - Industrial energy management is critical to ensuring efficient energy usage, market viability, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. In this study, the aim is to investigate energy management practices in paper and pulp in-dustries (PPI) of Bangladesh. The study identifies several barriers to adopt energy management practices; "Lack of governmental attention", "Inadequate staff awareness" and "limited access to capital" are identified as the major constraints. In addition, HVAC systems and compressed air systems present higher barriers compared to electrical motor and pump systems while looking at the barriers by technology areas. On the other hand, "Owner's demand", "Commitment from the top management" and "Pressure from the customers and different non-Governmental organization" are found to be the dominant drivers of energy management in the studied PPI. Energy management practices can enhance the energy efficiency approximately by 4-5 % according to the study. Furthermore, this study reveals that the majority of PPIs are unaware of the energy service companies (ESCO) with the lack of a standardized system for energy audit, as well as a lack of trust and information, appear-ing to be the obstacles behind this.(c) 2022 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Mitigating the sustainability challenges related to agriculture and ensuring adequate availability of nutritious food requires an increase in the use of sustainable alternative protein sources. Edible insects are considered to be a sustainable protein source and a possible substitute for meat. There are many readily available edible insect species with many competing utilization possibilities, which, from the producers' perspective, increases the complexity of the area. Through a consumer survey and expert interviews, this study recognizes four pathways to increasing the use of edible insects in Western countries and especially in Finland where the survey and interviews were conducted: (1) producing a variety of insect-based food products, especially food products where insects are not recognizable as such and the food is in a familiar form; (2) producing edible insect food products which could replace greenhouse gas emission-intensive animal proteins; (3) focusing on the price, taste, and availability of insect food; and (4) using insects as animal feed. Our findings provide information on the prospects of the studied pathways in terms of consumption and production. Technological development is expected to decrease the price of insect-based food products, but at the same time, the increased use of edible insects faces challenges related to eating habits, contradictory perceptions about the sustainability implications of insect farming, and the availability of insect-based products.

AB  - This paper demonstrates that network topologies play a key role in attracting people to use public transit; ridership is not solely determined by cultural characteristics (North American versus European versus Asian) or city design (transit oriented versus automobile oriented). The analysis considers 19 subway systems worldwide: those in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Chicago, Illinois; New York City; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco, California; Mexico City, Mexico; London; Paris; Lyon, France; Madrid, Spain; Berlin; Athens, Greece; Stockholm, Sweden; Moscow; Tokyo; Osaka, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and Singapore. The relationship between ridership and network design was studied by using updated graph theory concepts. Ridership was computed as the annual number of boardings per capita. Network design was measured according to three major indicators. The first is a measure of transit coverage and is based on the total number of stations and land area. The second relates to the maximum number of transfers necessary to go from one station to another and is called directness. The third attempts to get an overall view of transfer possibilities to travel in the network to appreciate a sense of mobility; it is termed connectivity. Multiple-regression analysis showed a strong relationship between these three indicators and ridership, achieving a goodness of fit (adjusted R-2 value) of .725. The importance of network design is significant and should be considered in future public transportation projects.

AB  - Structural characteristics of forest stands, e.g. in relation to carbon content and biodiversity, are of special interest. It has been stated in numerous publications that discrete return laser scanner data produce accurate tree canopy information since the quantiles of the height distribution of laser scanner data are related to the vertical structure of the tree canopy. Since some of the laser pulses will penetrate under the dominant tree layer, it is also possible to analyse multi-layered stands. In this Study, the existence and number of understory trees were examined. This was carried out by analysing the height distributions of reflected laser Pulses. In the laser data of this Study, (Toposys Falcon, survey May 2003 in Kalkkinen, Finland, flight altitude 400 m AGL) the average number of laser pulse hits/1m(2) was 12. The reference data consisted of 28 accurately measured field Sample plots. These plots, include highly heterogeneous structures of boreal forests. The existence of lower canopy layers, i.e. understory trees, was analysed visually by viewing the plotwise 3D-images of laser scanner-based canopy height point data and examining distributions of canopy densities which were computed as proportions of laser hits above different height quantiles. Furthermore, a developed histogram thresholding method (HistMod) was applied to the height distribution of laser hits in order to separate different tree storeys. Finally, the number and Lorey's mean height of understory trees were predicted with estimated regression models. The results show that multi-layered stand structures can be recognised and quantified using quantiles of laser scanner height distribution data. However, the accuracy of the results is dependent oil the density of the dominant tree layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   Community-based social enterprises (CBSEs), a spatially defined subset of social enterprise, are independent, not-for-profit organisations managed by community members and committed to delivering long-term benefits to local people. CBSEs respond to austerity and policy reforms by providing services, jobs and other amenities for residents in deprived communities, thus contributing to neighbourhood regeneration. This paper aims to develop a better understanding of how CBSEs perceive accountability, how they apply it in the management and representation of their business and why.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Nine case studies of CBSEs across three European countries (England, the Netherlands and Sweden) are analysed, using data from semi-structured interviews with initiators, board members and volunteers in CBSEs.
   Findings
   CBSEs shape accountability and representation in response to the needs of local communities and in the wake of day-to-day challenges and opportunities. Apart from financial reporting, CBSEs apply informal strategies of accountability which are highly embedded in their way of working and contingent upon their limited resources.
   Originality/value
   Although research has shown the complex governance position of CBSEs, their application of accountability to target communities and other stakeholders is unclear. The paper coins the term "adaptive accountability," reflecting a relational, dialectic approach in which formal, costly accountability methods are only applied to legally required forms of accounting, and informal practices are accepted by funding agencies and governments as valid forms of accountability, assessing CBSEs' societal value in more open terms.

AB  - This study aims to investigate ten hotels on the island of Gotland and their daily, practical work towards sustainability. An exploratory study was conducted at ten hotel establishments on the island of Gotland in Sweden. Ten hotel managers were interviewed about their daily practice and work towards sustainable solutions at their hotels. The results show that there are big differences between these hotels regarding the way in which knowledge about sustainability issues are implemented and shared to the personnel as well to the guests. In addition, there is a clear difference in the way in which sustainability is expressed in practice: the accountability is largely attributable to most of the hotels, but a few convey responsibility. Some of the managers seem to take a more active role in mediation of sustainability issues than is the case with the majority of the hotel managers. Also, anonymity between hotel guests and staff, large number of seasonal workers and insufficiently trained staff can be seen as a hindrance for knowledge exchange over the sustainability issues. Working with sustainability issues can also be seen as a way to win market shares in the hotel business. The study makes contribution to the knowledge of processes of co-creation of sustainable values by exploring how some hotel managers are working towards sustainability on a daily basis. The study can help to share knowledge of possibilities and hindrances in daily work towards sustainable hotels.

AB  - The frequency and intensity of droughts and heatwaves in Europe with notable impact on forest growth are expected to increase due to climate change. Coniferous stands planted outside the natural habitats of species belong to the most threatened forests. In this study, we assess stem circumference response of coniferous species (Larix decidua and Abies alba) to environmental conditions during the years 2015-2019. The study was performed in Arboretum in Zvolen (ca. 300 m a.s.l., Central Slovakia) characterised by a warmer and drier climate when compared to their natural habitats (located above 900 m a.s.l.), where they originated from. Seasonal radial variation, tree water deficit (Delta W), and maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) were derived from the records obtained from band dendrometers installed on five mature trees per species. Monitored species exhibited remarkably different growth patterns under highly above normal temperatures and uneven precipitation distribution. The magnitudes of reversible circumference changes (Delta W, MDS) were species-specific and strongly correlated with environmental factors. The wavelet analysis identified species-specific vulnerability to drought indicated by pronounced diurnal stem variation periodicity in rainless periods. L. decidua exhibited more strained stem water status and higher sensitivity to environmental conditions than A. alba. Tree water deficit and maximum daily shrinkage were found appropriate characteristics to compare water status of different tree species.

AB  - Four indicator bacteria were measured in association with physico-chemical constituents and selected inorganics during rainfall, baseflow and snowmelt periods in storm sewers of four urban catchments in a northern Swedish city. The variation patterns of coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens concentrations were assessed in manually collected grab samples together with those of phosphorus, nitrogen, solids, and readings of pH, turbidity, water conductivity, temperature and flow rates to examine whether these constituents could serve as potential indicators of bacteria sources. A similar analysis was applied to variation patterns of eight selected inorganics typical for base flow and stormwater runoff to test the feasibility of using these inorganics to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources of inflow into storm sewers. The monitored catchments varied in size, the degree of development, and land use. Catchment and season (i.e., rainy or snowmelt periods) specific variations were investigated for sets of individual stormwater samples by the principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the constituents with variation patterns similar to those of indicator bacteria, and to exclude the constituents with less similarity. In the reduced data set, the similarities were quantified by the clustering correlation analysis. Finally, the positive/negative relationships found between indicator bacteria and the identified associated constituent groups were described by multilinear regressions. In the order of decreasing concentrations, coliforms, E. coil and enterococci were found in the highest mean concentrations during both rainfall and snowmelt generated runoff. Compared to dry weather baseflow, concentrations of these three indicators in stormwater were 10 (snowmelt runoff) to 102 (rain runoff) times higher. C. perfringens mean concentrations were practically constant regardless of the season and catchment. The type and number of variables associated with bacteria depended on the degree of catchment development and the inherent complexity of bacteria sources. The list of variables associated with bacteria included the flow rate, solids with associated inorganics (Fe and Al) and phosphorus, indicating similar sources of constituents regardless of the season. On the other hand, bacteria were associated with water temperature only during rain periods, and somewhat important associations of bacteria with nitrogen and pH were found during the periods of snowmelt. Most of the associated constituents were positively correlated with bacteria responses, but conductivity, with two associated inorganics (Si and Sr), was mostly negatively correlated in all the catchments. Although the study findings do not indicate any distinct surrogates to indicator bacteria, the inclusion of the above identified constituents (flow rate, solids and total phosphorus for all seasons, water temperature for rainfall runoff, and total nitrogen and pH for snowmelt only) in sanitary surveys of northern climate urban catchments would provide additional insight into indicator bacteria sources and their modeling.

AB  - Nor-way has a long history in trying to develop management tools for sustainable development. From the early development of natural resources accounts in the 1980s, through discussions of the usefulness of indices like "green GDP" to efforts of developing sustainable development indicators, experiences have been gained. The paper seeks to both describe the landscape and discussions associated with the key terms, and to communicate some lessons drawn from the Norwegian experiences. The conclusion focuses on the fact that whatever information is collected and organised to support the relevant decision-making processes, the final outcome should always be judged in terms of its impacts on policy processes. Thus, we issue a warning against large-scale development of information systems, without due regard to the final utilisation of the output. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliable information on fish stocks is given crucial importance in fisheries science and ecosystem management. Among others, the European Water Framework Directive calls for consistent sampling methods that provide comparable and reproducible results. However, the standardized sampling of fish in lakes by gillnets is conducted by low effort only in the pelagic areas, thus potentially not reflecting between-lake variability in fish density. Here, we compared two additional fishing methods, hydroacoustics and mid-water trawl sampling, to estimate pelagic coregonid densities in two deep lakes. Night-time trawling was conducted in four different depth layers and compared with the simultaneously obtained abundance and biomass estimates from echo recordings. Overall areal fish biomass from both methods corresponded to each other (R-2 = 0.40). with slope and intercept of major axis regression not differing from unity. However, we found differences in estimates for the deepest layers fished, and for very small and the largest coregonids, most likely to be explained by the specific technological details of either method. Our study supports that either hydroacoustics or trawl sampling should accompany gillnet fishing to monitor pelagic fish assemblages. Because both methods result in estimates of absolute fish densities per volume or area, their application may uncover subtle responses of fish assemblages to anthropogenic disturbance in deep lakes.

AB  - Mortality in the production of farmed salmonids is a major constraint to the sustainability of this form of animal husbandry. We have developed a model for the daily mortality in salmon farming over a full production cycle from stocking to harvest, considering different environmental and production factors. These factors included sea temperature, salinity, day within year, fish weight at stocking, stocking day, four types of lice treatments and the possible occurrence of pancreas disease (PD). We considered a generalized additive model following full pro-duction cycles, allowing for non-linear descriptions of how relevant factors relate to the daily mortality. We saw a high overall mortality rate immediately after stocking, which decreased the first three months in the cycle and thereafter increased. We found that the total mortality could be reduced by 21% if avoiding all lice treatments, and similarly reduced by 20% if no PD infections occurred. If avoiding jointly PD and all lice treatments, the accumulated mortality could be reduced by 34%. A single thermal or hydrogen peroxide treatment was asso-ciated with a mortality of around 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively. This modeling approach gave a unique oppor-tunity to model how different factors interact on the overall global mortality and can easily be extended by other factors, such as additional fish diseases.

AB  - The productivity and functioning of mixed-species forests often differs from that of monocultures. However, the magnitude and direction of these differences are difficult to predict because species interactions can be modified by many potentially interacting climatic and edaphic conditions, stand structure and previous management. Process-based forest growth models could potentially be used to disentangle the effects of these factors and thereby improve our understanding of mixed forest functioning while facilitating their design and silvicultural management. However, to date, the predicted mixing effects of forest growth models have not been compared with measured mixing effects. In this study, 26 sites across Europe, each containing a mixture and monocultures of Fagus sylvatica and Pinus sylvestris, were used to calculate mixing effects on growth and yield and compare them with the mixing effects predicted by the forest growth model 3-PG(mix). The climate and edaphic conditions, stand structures and ages varied greatly between sites. The model performed well when predicting the stem mass and total mass (and mixing effects on these components), with model efficiency that was usually > 0.7. The model efficiency was lower for growth or smaller components such as foliage mass and root mass. The model was also used to predict how mixing effects would change along gradients in precipitation, temperature, potential available soil water, age, thinning intensity and soil fertility. The predicted patterns were consistent with measurements of mixing effects from published studies. The 3-PG model is a widely used management tool for monospecific stands and this study shows that 3-PGmb, can be used to examine the dynamics of mixed-species stands and determine how they may need to be managed.

AB  - A blue-green bioeconomy revolution is underway in Europe, with particular attention being paid to the development of new or underutilized marine biomass resources. The wild harvest and mariculture of low-trophic non-fed species of marine biomass may be contributing to circular economies, the mitigation of environmental problems such as eutrophication and climate change through the uptake of nutrients and carbon, while also recovering finite phosphorus from marine coastal environments, thus contributing to food security. The present study provides a cradle-to-gate life cycle perspective on seven established or innovative/emerging marine biomass utilization cases in Sweden: mariculture of sugar kelp, blue mussels, and ascidians and the harvest of invasive Pacific oysters along the Skagerrak coast, the mariculture of blue mussels in the Baltic sea, the harvest of common reed in the Stockholm archipelago, and the harvest of beach-cast seaweed in Gotland. Results showed that the mariculture cases were found to contribute to eutrophication and climate impact mitigation (at gate). All cases were found to contribute to closing the loop on phosphorus by enabling recovery from marine or coastal environments, bridging marine-land flows, all while performing well from an environmental perspective with a relatively low cumulative energy demand and low carbon and nutrient footprints. This highlights the potential of low-trophic biomass to contribute to phosphorus security in the future, and demonstrates the value of industrial ecology tools such as LCA in support of this imminent Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.

AB  - The technical development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and the parallel development of targeted therapies in the last decade have enabled a transition from traditional medicine to personalized treatment and care. In this way, by using comprehensive genomic testing, more effective treatments with fewer side effects are provided to each patient-that is, precision or personalized medicine (PM). In several European countries-such as in England, France, Denmark, and Spain-the governments have adopted national strategies and taken "top-down" decisions to invest in national infrastructure for PM. In other countries-such as Sweden, Germany, and Italy with regionally organized healthcare systems-the profession has instead taken "bottom-up" initiatives to build competence networks and infrastructure to enable equal access to PM. In this review, we summarize key learnings at the European level on the implementation process to establish sustainable governance and organization for PM at the regional, national, and EU/international levels. We also discuss critical ethical and legal aspects of implementing PM, and the importance of access to real-world data and performing clinical trials for evidence generation, as well as the need for improved reimbursement models, increased cross-disciplinary education and patient involvement. In summary, PM represents a paradigm shift, and modernization of healthcare and all relevant stakeholders-that is, healthcare, academia, policymakers, industry, and patients-must be involved in this system transformation to create a sustainable, non-siloed ecosystem for precision healthcare that benefits our patients and society at large.

AB  - Public sector organizations throughout Europe have been subject to cuts in Government spending, allied to demands for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, many have embarked upon radical programmes of change which potentially have an adverse effect upon the psychological well-being of employees. This study aimed to assess linkages between organization change and the psychological well-being of employees within the Swedish social insurance organization Forsakringskassan. A case study approach was adopted for the investigation which was carried out within the Halland region between February and June 1995. A questionnaire which included the Cultural Audit and the General Well Being Questionnaire was distributed to the organization's 456 employees in Halland. Questionnaires were returned by 246 employees (54.6%), reflecting the employment structure of the organization. The findings revealed that many issues associated with the process of rationalization and change were of concern to employees. Statistical analyses revealed that these were linked to their relatively high levels of 'anxiety' and their symptoms of being 'worn out'. This study indicates that the process of organization change is stressful for employees within Forsakringskassan. As public sector organizations throughout Europe are subject to similar pressures and are being forced to embark upon change programmes, it is suggested that they take cognizance of the findings of this investigation when making decisions regarding the planning and implementation of organization change.

AB  - This study draws on dual-processing theory and post-materialism assumptions to uncover the role of attitudinal and Materialistic values in determining the degree to which consumers are willing to pay premium prices for sustainable tourism services. Findings from a large-scale survey of Swedish potential ecotourists reveal that, while attitude and environmental beliefs relate positively to willingness to pay premium (WTPP) for ecotourism, materialistic values exert a negative effect In line with the theory of affect heuristics, study results further suggest that by giving rise to the intensity of feelings toward the offering, ecotourism interest alters the interplay of affective and evaluative antecedents, so that greater interest amplifies the influence, of affective attitude and materialistic values on WTPP while simultaneously attenuating the effect of environmental beliefs.

AB  - Climatic conditions, trophic links between species and dispersal may induce spatial synchrony in population fluctuations. Spatial synchrony increases the extinction risk of populations and, thus, it is important to understand how synchrony-inducing mechanisms affect populations already threatened by habitat loss and climate change. For many species, it is unclear how population fluctuations vary over time and space, and what factors potentially drive this variation. In this study, we focus on factors determining population fluctuations and spatial synchrony in the Siberian flying squirrel, Pteromys volans, using long-term monitoring data from 16 Finnish populations located 2-400 km apart. We found an indication of synchronous population dynamics on a large scale in flying squirrels. However, the synchrony was not found to be clearly related to distance between study sites because the populations seemed to be strongly affected by small-scale local factors. The regularity of population fluctuations varied over time. The fluctuations were linked to changes in winter precipitation, which has previously been linked to the reproductive success of flying squirrels. Food abundance (tree mast) and predator abundance were not related to population fluctuations in this study. We conclude that spatial synchrony was not unequivocally related to distance in flying squirrels, as has been observed in earlier studies for more abundant rodent species. Our study also emphasises the role of climate in population fluctuations and the synchrony of the species.

AB  - Eco-efficiency and sustainable development are the key environmental topics and goals for today's society that we should strive for in all activities, including contaminated soil management (CSM). However, particularly at the regional level, CSM is studied to a lesser extent from this perspective and practical means to monitor and assess sustainability or eco-efficiency are not widely available. This study aims to fill this gap by developing indicators to measure and monitor the development of regional eco-efficiency of CSM. The indicators can be used to support decision-making at the regional level since many CSM decisions, such as prioritisation of sites and the number of soil treatment and storing facilities, are made regionally. To start with, we surveyed the methods available for determining eco-efficiency and suitable indicators to monitor and measure the development of CSM regionally. We used life cycle analysis (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA) to identify factors that the environmental indicators should cover, and also involved economic indicators. We ended up with a selection of 28 indicators, which can be classed into three different categories: background indicators, environmental indicators and economic indicators. We further demonstrated the use of the indicators by applying data from three different regions in Finland, and evaluated their suitability. On the basis of the results we recommended 15 indicators for continuous follow-up and decision-making purposes. Even though these indicators are suitable for monitoring and measuring the eco-efficiency of CSM at the regional level, unfortunately we found several data gaps related to the actual remediation projects which impede their use in practice. The data collection practices therefore need to be regionally developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sustainability of shade-intermediate tree species such as Douglas fir in complex forest structures (with more than two distinct storeys) has been controversially discussed for a long time and traditionally shade-tolerant tree species have been preferred in plenter forest management. The most critical question in this context is whether recruitment trees of a particular species can survive in the shady conditions of the understorey and whether they can contribute to a demographic continuity. Using data from the unique, replicated monitoring site Artist's Wood in North Wales (UK) we investigated the recruitment dynamics of Douglas fir to address the question whether this species can grow in complex forest structures on a long-term basis. Then we compared the results with those from Norway spruce and silver fir plenter forests in the Swiss Jura. Demographic continuity in complex structures is ensured if all forest development stages are represented in appropriate demographic proportions. We quantified these development stages in terms of stem diameter classes and analysed the corresponding diameter growth, competition and the loss of trees due to mortality and forest management. Based on this analysis we determined demographic equilibrium conditions for Artist's Wood. The results confirmed that Douglas fir at Artist's Wood can indeed grow sustainably in complex forest structures at a stand density of 27.4 m(2) ha(-1) basal area which corresponds to a standing volume of 342 m(3) ha(-1). However, equilibrium conditions for Douglas fir can only be achieved at the expense of a lower overall stand density of approximately 85% of that of Norway spruce. Despite this the corresponding Douglas fir stand volume increment of 15.3 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) is greater than that of Norway spruce. Thus Douglas fir plenter forests are not only possible but are also appealing considering the broad site amplitude of the species in conjunction with ongoing climate change and the potential of the species for CO2 retention.

AB  - The morphological characteristics of the North American invasive species Kellicottia bostoniensis Rousselet, 1908 from 29 different types of water bodies and watercourses of the Middle Volga basin, have been studied. The water bodies serving as habitats for K. bostoniensis are in several areas that significantly differ in a set of characteristics, such as geological structure, relief, climate, degree of anthropogenic impact, and hydrochemical and hydrophysical parameters. The size of K. bostoniensis individuals from most of the studied water bodies and watercourses have been measured and analyzed for the first time. A high positive correlation has been revealed between the total body length and posterior spine length (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.01), as well as between the total body length and anterior spine length (R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.01). A relationship has been revealed between the lengths of the anterior and posterior spines (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.01). K. bostoniensis individuals from the studied water bodies and watercourses are characterized by a large size (the median values of the total body length are 236-440 mu m). This size is similar to that of individuals from the native habitats of this species in North America and some biotopes of Europe and European Russia. In all the water bodies in Russia and other counties (Belarus, Sweden, Finland, Brazil, and Argentina) where the morphological variability of K. bostoniensis was previously studied, the largest body size was recorded for the invasive species in the Sura River. K. bostoniensis individuals recorded in deep mesotrophic water bodies with a high transparency are larger than those in shallow eutrophic water bodies with a lower transparency in the Middle Volga basin. Our data on the morphological characteristics of the invasive species in the water bodies of the Middle Volga basin significantly expand the existing data on the morphological variability of K. bostoniensis individuals and their dependence on environmental factors.

AB  - In 1972 I attended the Pre-Olympic Scientific Congress in Munich. For the first time science and sport were brought together in connection with the Olympic Games. The organizers presented a book Sport in Blickpunkt der Wissenschaften (Sport from a Scientific Point of View) that summarized history and state of the art of the main sport scientific approaches (41). The German philosopher Hans Lenk gave a presentation of a broad array of past and present interpretations of sport from a philosophic viewpoint (49). The congress in Munch and Hans Lenk's presentation of sport as a suitable philosophic topic became decisive for my own lifelong interest in philosophy of sport. Soon after the Munich conference some American philosophers convened to launch the Philosophic Society for the Study of Sport. In 1973 the first issue of Journal of Philosophy of Sport was published (35). In several ways 1972 was a turning point for philosophy of sport as a serious academic discipline and for my own interest in sport philosophy. From here sport philosophy found its way to Norway and through this and along several other roads to other Nordic countries.
   In the following I will present an overview of philosophy of sport in the Nordic countries. The main focus will be on Norway. I think this is suitable, or at least defensible, since Norway arguably has the strongest position in sport philosophy among the Nordic countries. In addition I know the philosophy and the sport terrain best on my home ground. I have received valuable input from scholars both in Norway and the other Nordic countries that made it possible for me to write this article(i). I will start with a short presentation of the cultural and historical context and the general philosophical background before I move to philosophy of sport and present the main themes and developments, the leading figures, the institutional anchoring; courses and programs. I then discuss the size and health of the discipline, its international relations and challenges for the future. The presentation of the other Nordic countries is much shorter. I end by summing up some main lines in the picture.

AB  - AimTo obtain a plausible hypothesis for the historical distribution of North Atlantic right whales (NARWs) (Eubalaena glacialis) in their summer feeding grounds. Previously widespread in the North Atlantic, after centuries of hunting, these whales survive as a small population off eastern North America. Because their exploitation began before formal records started, information about their historical distribution is fragmentary.
   LocationNorth Atlantic and North Pacific oceans.
   MethodsWe linked historical records of North Pacific right whales (E.japonica; from 19th-century American whaling logbooks) with oceanographic data to generate a species distribution model. Assuming that the two species have similar environmental preferences, the model was projected into the North Atlantic to predict environmental suitability for NARWs. The reliability of these predictions was assessed by comparing the model results with historical and recent records in the North Atlantic.
   ResultsThe model predicts suitable environmental conditions over a wide, mostly offshore band across the North Atlantic. Predictions are well supported by historical and recent records, but discrepancies in some areas indicate lower discriminative ability in coastal, shallow-depth areas, suggesting that this model mainly describes the summer offshore distribution of right whales.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that the summer range of the NARW consisted of a relatively narrow band (width c.10 degrees in latitude), extending from the eastern coast of North America to northern Norway, over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, south of Greenland and Iceland, north of the British Isles and in the Norwegian Sea. These results highlight possibilities for additional research both on the history of exploitation and on the current summer distribution of this species. In particular, better survey coverage of historical whaling grounds could help inform conservation efforts for this endangered species. More generally, this study illustrates the challenges and opportunities in using historical data to understand the original distribution of highly depleted species.

CP  - 8th Highway and Urban Environment Symposium (8HUES)
AB  - As part of the European Union 5th Framework Programme (EU FP5) sustainable storm water management project DayWater, an international monitoring programme was established to investigate the ecotoxicity of highway and urban runoff samples. This involved the collection of samples from a total of 35 storm events from sites in Sweden (Lulea and Stockholm), Germany (Wuppertal), and France (Nantes). To enable both chronic and acute end points to be addressed, the ecotoxicity tests were performed using rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus), bacteria (Vibrio ficherii), and algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Samples collected at the Stockholm site were additionally analysed for a range of water quality parameters enabling this site to be considered from a combined physico-chemical and ecotoxicological perspective. This paper provides an overview of the results of the whole monitoring programme and demonstrates that storm water frequently exerts a toxic effect. Although the levels of ecotoxicity detected were found to vary greatly in relation to sites, storm events and test organisms, further analysis demonstrated a moderately strong correlation between the responses of algae and rotifer tests. Microtox was generally found to be the most responsive test in terms of both frequency of detection of toxicity and level at which a toxic impact could be detected.

AB  - Production diseases, such as metabolic and reproductive disorders, mastitis, and lameness, emerge from complex interactions between numerous factors (or variables) but can be controlled by the right management decisions. Since animal husbandry systems in practice are very diverse, it is difficult to identify the most influential components in the individual farm context. However, it is necessary to do this to control disease, since farmers are severely limited in their access to resources, and need to invest in management measures most likely to have an effect. In this study, systemic impact analyses were conducted on 192 organic dairy farms in France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden in the context of reducing the prevalence of production diseases. The impact analyses were designed to evaluate the interrelationships between farm variables and determine the systemic roles of these variables. In particular, the aim was to identify the most influential variables on each farm. The impact analysis consisted of a stepwise process: (i) in a participatory process 13 relevant system variables affecting the emergence of production diseases on organic dairy farms were defined; (ii) the interrelationships between these variables were evaluated by means of an impact matrix on the farm-level, involving the perspectives of the farmer, an advisor and the farm veterinarian; and (iii) the results were then used to identify general system behaviour and to classify variables by their level of influence on other system variables and their susceptibility to influence. Variables were either active (high influence, low susceptibility), reactive (low influence, high susceptibility), critical (both high), or buffering (both low). An overall active tendency was found for feeding regime, housing conditions, herd health monitoring, and knowledge and skills, while milk performance and financial resources tended to be reactive. Production diseases and labour capacity had a tendency for being critical while reproduction management, dry cow management, calf and heifer management, hygiene and treatment tended to have a buffering capacity. While generalised tendencies for variables emerged, the specific role of variables could vary widely between farms. The strength of this participatory impact assessment approach is its ability, through filling in the matrix and discussion of the output between farmer, advisor and veterinarian, to explicitly identify deviations from general expectations, thereby supporting a farm-specific selection of health management strategies and measures.

AB  - Research on ecosystem stability has had a strong focus on local systems. However, environmental change often occurs slowly at broad spatial scales, which requires regional-level assessments of long-term stability. In this study, we assess the stability of macroinvertebrate communities across 105 lakes in the Swedish "lakescape." Using a hierarchical mixed-model approach, we first evaluate the environmental pressures affecting invertebrate communities in two ecoregions (north, south) using a 23 year time series (1995-2017) and then examine how a set of environmental and physical variables affect the stability of these communities. Results show that lake latitude, size, total phosphorus and alkalinity affect community composition in northern and southern lakes. We find that lake stability is affected by species richness and lake size in both ecoregions and alkalinity and total phosphorus in northern lakes. There is large heterogeneity in the patterns of community stability of individual lakes, but relationships between that stability and environmental drivers begin to emerge when the lakescape, composed of many discrete lakes, is the focal unit of study. The results of this study highlight that broad-scale comparisons in combination with long time series are essential to understand the effects of environmental change on the stability of lake communities in space and time.

AB  - Surface wave (SW) methods offer promising options for an effective and sustainable development of seismic exploration, but they still remain under-exploited in hard rock sites. We present a successful application of active and passive surface wave tomography for the characterization of the southern continuation of the Siilinjarvi phosphate deposit (Finland). A semi-automatic workflow for the extraction of the path-average dispersion curves (DCs) from ambient seismic noise data is proposed, including identification of time windows with strong coherent SW signal, azimuth analysis and two-station method for DC picking. DCs retrieved from passive data are compared with active SW tomography results recently obtained at the site. Passive data are found to carry information at longer wavelengths, thus extending the investigation depth. Active and passive DCs are consequently inverted together to retrieve a deep pseudo-3D shearwave velocity model for the site, with improved resolution. The southern continuation of the mineralization, its contacts with the host rocks and different sets of cross-cutting diabase dikes are well imaged in the final velocity model. The seismic results are compared with the latest available geological models to both validate the proposed workflow and improve the interpretation of the geometry and extent of the mineralization. Important large-scale geological boundaries and structural discontinuities are recognized from the results, demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the methods for mineral exploration perspectives.

AB  - The bryozoan Schizoporella japonica Ortmann (1890) was first recorded in European waters in 2010 and has since been reported from further locations in Great Britain (GB) and Norway. This paper provides a new earliest European record for the species from 2009, a first record from Ireland and presence and absence records from a total of 231 marinas and harbours across GB, Ireland, the Isle of Man, France and Portugal. This species is typically associated with human activity, including commercial and recreational vessels, aquaculture equipment, and both wave and tidal energy devices. It has also been observed in the natural environment, fouling rocks and boulders. The species has an extensive but widely discontinuous distribution in GB and Ireland. Although found frequently in marinas and harbours in Scotland, it inhabits only a few sites in England, Wales and Ireland, interspersed with wide gaps that are well documented as genuine absences. This appears to be a rare example of a southward-spreading invasion in GB and Ireland. The species has been reported from the Isle of Man and Norway but has not been found in France or Portugal. In the future we expect S. japonica to spread into suitable sections of the English, Welsh and Irish coasts, and further within Europe. The species' capability for long-distance saltatory spread and potential for negative impact on native ecosystems and economic activity suggests that S. japonica should now be considered invasive in GB and Ireland. As such, it is recommended that biosecurity procedures alongside effective surveillance and monitoring should be prioritised for regions outside the species' current distribution.

AB  - The development of industry and a welfare state in Sweden has been accompanied by and, to some extent, spurred on by a rapid increase in metal production. As in other modern societies a range of increasingly sophisticated metallic products has been developed.Emissions from both production and consumption (use) of these products have induced changes that overwhelm the natural biogeochemical cycle of trace elements in many ecosystems. It is contended that in order to understand the environmental problems of tomorrow it is necessary to study the total flows of various substances in a historical perspective. In order to plot the immission landscape at different times, emission, flow and accumulation of lead have been reconstructed. The importance of different sources is discussed and the regional anthropogenic contribution in relation to the natural background levels, orginating from bedrock, is elucidated. The calculated amounts for both production and consumption emissions were approximately 190 000 tonnes. The share of consumption emissions was 85% with about a quarter each for ammunition and petrol and one third for other sources (e.g. lead pigments, cables and batteries). Emissions from point sources (e.g. metalworks) have resulted in large amounts of accumulated lead in the soil and sediment. As the use of lead products is related to the distribution of the population, the most dominant regions are urban areas, which increasingly can be regarded as ecological "hot spots".

TI  - Regulating Uber: The Politics of the Platform Economy in Europe and the United States
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS
LA  - English
AB  - I use the case of the transportation network company Uber as a lens to explore the comparative politics of the platform economy in Europe and the United States. Within the advanced capitalist world, different countries have responded in very different ways to this new service, from welcome embrace and accommodating regulatory adjustments to complete rejection and legal bans. I analyze Uber's arrival and reception in the United States, Germany, and Sweden, documenting three very different responses to this disruptive new actor. I show that conflicts over Uber centered on different issues in the three countries. These differences were consequential because the specific regulatory "flashpoints" that Uber provoked mobilized different actors, inspired the formation of different coalitions, and shaped the terms on which conflicts over Uber were framed and fought.

AB  - Hobby metal detectorists search for archaeological finds as individuals and within groups, the latter being the focus of this article. Such groups come together as "clubs" and "meetings," but also as part of large, often commercially run events typically known as "rallies." All these activities are attractive to detectorists because they provide them with access to land to search, along with the promise of making interesting (even valuable) discoveries, and they have a social dimension. They are common in England and also well established in several countries in northwest Europe, partly due to changing legislation. Although policies and mechanisms are often in place for collaboration with individual detectorists and even local metal-detecting clubs, larger events (not least, the large-scale commercial rallies increasingly occurring in England) present challenges for professional archaeologists, specifically in relation to the capacity to properly record finds and manage potential damage to the historic environment. To respond appropriately to these changes, a greater understanding of detectorists' events is needed. For this reason, we explore and define the scale, nature, and diversity of group events, relating them to different legislative and cultural contexts in Flanders (Belgium), England (and Wales), and Finland. Subsequently, we outline challenges associated with group events and identify possible ways forward.

AB  - Nutrient exports from soils have important implications for long-term patterns of nutrient limitation on land and resource delivery to aquatic environments. While plant-soil systems are notably efficient at retaining limiting nutrients, spatial and temporal mismatches in resource supply and demand may create opportunities for hydrologic losses to occur. Spatial mismatches may be particularly important in peat-forming landscapes, where the development of a two-layer vertical structure can isolate plant communities on the surface from resource pools that accumulate at depth. Our objectives were to test this idea in northern Sweden, where nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial plants is widespread, and where peat-forming, mire ecosystems are dominant features of the landscape. We quantified vertical patterns of N chemistry in a minerogenic mire, estimated the seasonal and annual hydrologic export of organic and inorganic N from this system, and evaluated the broader influence of mire cover on N chemistry across a stream network. Relatively high concentrations of ammonium (up to 2 mg l(-1)) were observed in groundwater several meters below the peat surface, and N was routed to the outlet stream along deep, preferential flowpaths. Areal estimates of inorganic N export from the mire were several times greater than from an adjacent, forested catchment, with markedly higher loss rates during the growing season, when plant N demand is ostensibly greatest. At broader scales, mire cover was positively correlated with long-term concentrations of inorganic and organic N in streams across the drainage network. This study provides an example of how mire formation and peat accumulation can create broad-scale heterogeneity in nutrient supply and demand across boreal landscapes. This mismatch allows for hydrologic losses of reactive N that are independent of annual plant demand and potentially important to receiving lakes and streams.

AB  - Bottom trawling has widespread impacts on benthic communities and habitats. While the direct impacts of trawl disturbances on benthic communities have been extensively studied, the consequences from long-term chronic disturbances are less well understood. The response of benthic macrofauna to chronic otter-trawl disturbance from a Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) fishery was investigated along a gradient of fishing intensity over a muddy fishing ground in the northeastern Irish Sea. Chronic otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on benthic infauna abundance, biomass, and species richness. Benthic epifauna abundance and species richness also showed a significant, negative response, while no such effect was evident for epibenthic biomass. Furthermore, chronic trawl disturbance led to clear changes in community composition of benthic infauna and epifauna. The results presented indicate that otter-trawl impacts are cumulative and can lead to profound changes in benthic communities, which may have far-reaching implications for the integrity of marine food webs. Studies investigating the short-term effects of fishing manipulations previously concluded that otter trawling on muddy substrates had only modest effects on the benthic biota. Hence, the results presented by this study highlight that data from experimental studies can not be readily extrapolated to an ecosystem level and that subtle cumulative effects may only become apparent when fishing disturbances are examined over larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this study shows that data on chronic effects of bottom trawling on the benthos will be vital in informing the recently advocated move toward an ecosystem approach in fisheries management. As bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.

AB  - This study was undertaken to document whether a basic set of a new unilateral external fixation device could provide sufficient stability in complex musculoskeletal injuries involving upper and lower extremities and in patients with unstable pelvic ring disruptions. The initial clinical evaluation was performed in Sweden (stage 1) followed by field evaluation at the Swedish Field Hospital during the Mogadishu conflict in Somalia (stage 2). In stage 1, there were 90 patients with 116 acute limb injuries and six patients with an unstable pelvic ring disruption. Ninety limb injuries and all six pelvic fractures were primarily stabilized by the external fixation device. The other 26 fractures were managed at the index operation with intramedullary nailing, open reduction, and internal fixation or cast immobilization. Twelve patients had a local pedicle or free vascularized flap for soft tissue coverage. One multiply injured with an open Gustilo IIIB tibial shaft fracture had an early amputation. The basic set provided adequate stabilization for soft tissue recovery in 89 limb injuries (89 of 90), thereby providing optimal conditions for continued management to skeletal consolidation in ss patients. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved in all six patients with unstable pelvic fractures. In stage 2, there were 63 patients with war injuries and 33 patients injured in traffic accidents. All were managed under field conditions. The basic set was sufficient for soft tissue recovery in all 96 cases. It is concluded that the rigidity of this device is adequate for stabilization of severe musculoskeletal injuries requiring major surgical procedures. In addition, the simplicity of this device, which allows for only a limited number of possible configurations makes it suitable for inexperienced surgeons working under war or mass-casualty conditions to manage these complex musculoskeletal injuries.

AB  - This study aims to define the level of naturalness in the protected forests of eastern Fennoscandia, i.e. to determine how natural or semi-natural are the currently protected and unmanaged forests, and the extent to which the past human influence has affected the current forest structure. The plots used in the study represent both currently unmanaged and managed forests. The unmanaged forests are located in nature protection areas. We have used data from earlier forest inventories, determined by the visual estimation of compartments, together with the measured stand variables. The data cover detailed analysis of 79 forest sites or stands in both in mesic and sub-xeric forests. The whole successional gradient is included in the data.
   In unmanaged forests, fellings have occurred on 39% of the sample plots in sub-xeric areas, and on 28% of the sample plots in mesic areas. According to the historical records 33% of all the unmanaged forests have definitely been (selectively) felled, 21% possibly, and 46% show no signs of fellings. In general, the unmanaged forests in eastern Finland bear ample evidence of light selection felling, Thus, these stands could better be regarded as semi-natural rather than natural forests. Mesic old-growth stands are less affected (73% are completely untouched), but the tree volume data, number of tree storeys and the signs of slash-and-burn cultivation are nevertheless clear evidence of the impact of human activities.
   The growing intensity of human activities since the 1950s can also be seen in semi-natural succession forests as the presence of cut stumps and the probability of felling in young stages. Real natural/semi-natural sapling and young forests are very rare and occur only in Russia. The diameter distribution in semi-natural sapling and young forests with reverse J-shaped distributions showed considerably greater variation. Also the mature and old-growth, semi-natural forests were characterised by the decrease in reverse J-shaped distributions. The timber volume in stands was generally lower at the beginning of the 20th century. Overall, the forests in nature reserves axe structurally rather different to those growing at the beginning of the 20th century, and show patterns not typical of natural forests. The slash-and-burn agriculture practised during the 1800s and earlier has profoundly affected the natural spatial and temporal disturbance regimes, with clear consequences for the current tree species and age composition. More recent deviations from the natural forest structures are, however, largely due to the absence of natural and anthropogenic forest fires during the 1900s. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an intense desiccation of spruce forests in the Ukrainian Carpathians, where European spruce is the main forest-forming species. Over the recent years, desiccation has spread to the spruce forest stands which grow in the Carpathians at the height of over 1,000 m above the sea level. This process causes large economic losses, significant deterioration of the condition and productivity of the forests in the Carpathians, decrease in the level of provision of ecosystemic services by forests, functions they perform, therefore leading to dangerous exogenic processes (floods, freshets, erosion, mudflows, landslides). To determine the interaction between the radial increment and sanitary condition of the spruce stands and substantiate the measures of the use of drying spruce forests, in the Vysokohirsky forestry reserve district of the Ukrainian Carpathians in anti-erosion forests, in hotbeds of desiccation of spruce in 2018, dendrochronological surveys were undertaken in two monitoring plots in forests in weak and severely weakened condition. We collected cores from the model trees, measured width of the annual rings, and developed individual dendpochronologies according to the absolute values of the radial increments and generalized dendrochronologies according to the absolute values of the radial increments and increment indices of the duration of 97 (1921-2017) and 81 years (1937-2017). We conducted single-factor dispersion analysis, calculated the indices of abnormality of the radial increments and correlation coefficient. The results revealed that the lowest increments occurred in the years 1965-1990 in the weakened stand and in 1997-2017 in the severely weakened stand. The relative indices of the forests ranged 83.8-114.6%. The cycles of increment lasted 7-9 years. Over the last few decades, favourable conditions for the growth of the trees took place in 1991-2010, unfavourable in 2011-2017, very unfavourable in 1981-1990. Synchronicity of annual radial increments in the spruce of two monitoring plots equaled 49 years. Correlation coefficient indicates that the type of the conditions of growth location has a significant effect on its variability in the process of trees' life cycle. Average radial increment of the weakened stand of trees over the last 10 years decreased by 7.9%, while it declined by 54.9% in the severely weakened stand compared with the average increments of the tree stands for the surveyed periods, suggesting that the forests undergo different stages of succession: the weakened stand undergoes the stage of recovery after disturbance, severely weakened forest - stage of disturbance. The studies revealed the dependence of radial increment of spruce on the sanitary condition of the forests. The results of the studies may be used for the assessment of dynamic processes in forest ecosystems as a result of the impact of various factors and planning of the forestry measures.

AB  - This study focuses on norms and informal sanctions of catch-and-release angling and their implications for fishery management. A Web-based questionnaire of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., anglers in the Lakselva River, Norway, yielded 656 answers (response rate 68 %). Anglers were segmented into four subgroups: catch and release, keeper, something else, trophy angler. In all groups, the reward (positive feeling) was high and punishment was low for releasing a large salmon as expressed by the intensity of self-sanctions. All groups saw keeping a large salmon mostly as a rewarding experience, although the C&R and trophy segments reported less rewards and more 'punishment' for keeping. There is evidence for both a medium strength C&R norm and a weak keep norm in this fishery, receiving different ascriptions between angler groups. The results help understand angler group conflicts and explain how angling behaviour is formed, thereby helping management agencies achieving angler satisfaction.

AB  - Restoration of mixed oak forest in northern temperate regions is important for biodiversity and for adaptation of forest management to climate change. Direct seeding has been considered as a cost-effective method for the assisted regeneration of oaks. However, removal of acorns by granivorous rodents hinders its application. Patterns of acorn removal can vary with habitat type, presence of predators, and acorn size. In this field study, we tested the effects of distance to forest edge, predator excrement as a repellent, and acorn size on the performance of direct-seeded oak in southern Sweden. The experiment was carried out at two different sites. Our hypotheses were: (i) in clear-cuts, acorn removal is higher closer to the forest edge compared to open areas, (ii) treatment with predator excrement reduces acorn removal without affecting germination, and (iii) larger acorns will be removed more readily than smaller acorns. Finally, we also investigated if seedlings from larger acorns survive better and grow taller compared to smaller acorns in relation to habitat structure and predator excrement as repellent. Acorn removal differed at the two sites. At Skrylle (older clear-cut), no forest edge effects were found. At Klaverod (new clear-cut site), our results suggest that removal of acorns was higher in the open clear-cut due to the presence of large slash piles. Less vegetation coverage correlated with lower rates of acorn removal, except near slash piles. Our results therefore suggest that forest managers should reduce understory vegetation and avoid slash piles during direct seeding of oak. Mink excrement failed to protect acorns against removal, but did not reduce acorn germination. Bigger acorns produced taller seedlings but did not enhance overall woodland establishment due to their higher removal rate. Our results further suggest a potential food satiation effect due to an extra supply of additional food. Satiation manipulation might potentially be a method of mitigating the impact of seed predation by granivorous rodents during the direct seeding of oak, but such an approach requires further research before it could be recommended.

AB  - Constructed free water surface wetlands (CWs) are used to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to receiving waters in highly impacted catchments by e.g., agricultural land use. In this paper, we evaluated the retention effectiveness of a Swedish CW in two consecutive hydrological years, 3-4 years after construction respectively. We compared nutrient loads based on concentrations from flow-proportional sampling (C-fp) and turbidity and nitrate concentrations measured with optical sensors (C-s). CW's retention was estimated based on differences between inlet and outlet concentrations and flow (Q) at both the inlet and outlet (2Q), or only at the inlet (1Q). In the first year (2012/2013), with a cold winter (mean topsoil temperature -0.2 degrees C), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3N) retention was 32% (C-fp and C-s, 2Q). In the second year, with a mild winter (mean topsoil temp 1.8 degrees C) and less water runoff, the corresponding values were 37% (C-fp, 2Q) and 39% (C-s, 2Q). Nitrate-nitrogen retention was significantly correlated to water residence time and temperature, and was most effective relative to the load (80%) in summer and least effective (40%) in winter. Quantitatively, however, summer NO3N retention contributed only 7% (2Q) or 8% (1Q) of yearly NO3N mass retention. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations were significantly correlated with suspended solids (SS) concentrations at both inlet and outlet. Seasonal PP retention (C-fp, 2Q) was related to particle residence time estimated from turbidity measurements by sensors, and was less effective in the cold winter (3%) than in the mild winter (32%) (C-fp, 2Q). Yearly retention (2Q) as a mean of the two years was: SS 40%, total P 36%, PP 34%, dissolved reactive P 30%, total N 56%, NO3N 35%, organic N 75%, and organic C 30%. Overall, the wetland satisfactorily removed nutrients from agricultural drainage water. However, longer-term studies over a range of flow and temperature conditions are needed to evaluate climate conditions and hydrological residence time as key factors in nutrient removal efficiency.

AB  - This article describes an investigation into how to build agency among growers so they take the lead in transforming their own activity of managing whiteflies. The study shows how the principle of Transformative Agency by Double Stimulation (TADS) was applied in a formative intervention based on the Change Laboratory method for developing pest management among greenhouse vegetable producers in Finnish Ostrobothnia. The data comprise audio recorded sessions, documentary data and observations produced and collected during the intervention. The results show how the collective construction of a continuous series of models during the intervention played an important role in learning, prompting TADS among the participants and working as a communication tool for the practitioners' different conceptualizations of the problem and possible solutions. The models allowed materializing and expanding the way the participants understood the temporal, functional and spatial aspects of the problem. In the study, TADS took place through conflict of stimuli and motives, first stimulus, auxiliary breaking-away second stimulus, and actions that were initiated to improve the management of the problem at hand. In conclusion, the principle of double stimulation was useful to produce transformative agency, helping transform the activity of pest management among the horticultural producers.

AB  - Sustainability science needs approaches that allow for the integration of knowledge across disciplines and scales. This paper suggests an approach to conceptualize problems of unsustainability by embedding the Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) scheme within a multi-level institutional framework represented by Hagerstrand's system of nested domains. The proposed taxonomy helps to decipher and to better understand key casual chains and societal responses at the appropriate spatial levels for particular sustainability problem areas. To illustrate the scheme more concretely the example of recent problem-solving efforts for Baltic Sea eutrophication driven by Swedish agriculture is examined. The discussion focuses on how the scheme fulfills the four research strategy requirements within the field of sustainability science and how the scheme is distinct from alternative approaches.

AB  - In a sustainable production of animals, monitoring and minimizing mortality must be a top priority. Systematic measuring of mortality over time can be used to evaluate the impact of changes in management and production strategies in Norway. To aid understanding of the potential for reducing mortality, we have used data from 2014 to 2018 to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of mortality, by descriptive analyses and statistical modelling of possible determinants of mortality. The results show large differences in mortality across different production zones and between years. The areas with the highest density of farmed salmon are also the ones with highest mortality. The total cumulated mortality of farmed salmon increased from 32.3 million in 2014 to 35.2 million in 2018, corresponding to 14.3% and 15.8% of the standing stock. An initial higher mortality was observed during the first 3 months after stocking (mean: 1.5% [0.9%-8.6%] mortality/month). This was followed by a period of stability and lower mortality (mean: 0.8% [0.9%-3.1%] mortality/month), until month 10, when mortality started to increase again. The month of first stocking, the year of slaughter, production zone and number of months at sea were all found to be statistically significant determinants for mortality, with p-values < 1e-15.

AB  - Wild Atlantic salmon populations have declined in many regions and are affected by diverse natural and anthropogenic factors. To facilitate management guidelines, precise knowledge of mechanisms driving population changes in demographics and life history traits is needed. Our analyses were conducted on (a) age and growth data from scales of salmon caught by angling in the river Etneelva, Norway, covering smolt year classes from 1980 to 2018, (b) extensive sampling of the whole spawning run in the fish trap from 2013 onwards, and (c) time series of sea surface temperature, zooplankton biomass, and salmon lice infestation intensity. Marine growth during the first year at sea displayed a distinct stepwise decline across the four decades. Simultaneously, the population shifted from predominantly 1SW to 2SW salmon, and the proportion of repeat spawners increased from 3 to 7%. The latter observation is most evident in females and likely due to decreased marine exploitation. Female repeat spawners tended to be less catchable than males by anglers. Depending on the time period analyzed, marine growth rate during the first year at sea was both positively and negatively associated with sea surface temperature. Zooplankton biomass was positively associated with growth, while salmon lice infestation intensity was negatively associated with growth. Collectively, these results are likely to be linked with both changes in oceanic conditions and harvest regimes. Our conflicting results regarding the influence of sea surface temperature on marine growth are likely to be caused by long-term increases in temperature, which may have triggered (or coincided with) ecosystem shifts creating generally poorer growth conditions over time, but within shorter datasets warmer years gave generally higher growth. We encourage management authorities to expand the use of permanently monitored reference rivers with complete trapping facilities, like the river Etneelva, generating valuable long-term data for future analyses.

AB  - Reliability and punctuality of railway traffic are among the key performance indicators, which have a significant impact on user satisfaction. A way to improve the reliability and on-time performance in the timetable design stage is by improving the timetable robustness. In order to increase the robustness, most railway companies in Europe insert a fixed amount of buffer time between possibly conflicting events in order to reduce or prevent delay propagation if the first event occurs with a delay. However, this often causes an increase of capacity consumption which is a problem for heavily utilised lines. A sufficient amount of buffer time can therefore not be added between every two conflicting events. Thus, buffer times need to be allocated carefully to protect events with the highest priority. In this paper we consider the problem of increasing the robustness of a timetable by finding an optimal allocation of buffer times on a railway corridor. We model this resource allocation problem as a knapsack problem, where each candidate buffer time is treated as an object with the value (priority for buffer time assignment) determined according to the commercial and operational criteria, and size equal to its time duration. The validity of the presented approach is demonstrated on a case study from a busy mixed-traffic line in Sweden. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of the dynamics of knowledge production in the context of large-scale environmental projects causing local conflict. In particular, the paper analyses the discourse coalitions that formed around an artificial groundwater recharge project for the Turku Region in Finland. The material for this study consists of over 400 articles and opinion pieces which were collected from local and regional newspapers between 1999 and 2010. The articles were analysed by using Hajer's [1995. The politics of environmental discourse. Ecological modernisation and the policy process. Oxford, UK: Clarendon] discursive framework, and the analysis was complemented with the concept of knowledge coalition by Van Buuren and Edelenbos [2004. Conflicting knowledge. Why is joint knowledge production such a problem? Science and Public Policy, 31 (4), 289-299]. Results of the study indicate that knowledge coalitions were formed among the researchers, lay residents, and policy-makers, and they all utilised similar expertise-based factual arguments to support their cause. Thus, the paper participates in the academic discussion on the use and interpretation of expert knowledge in environmental policy-making by reshaping the division between experts and lay residents.

AB  - In 2015, observers argued that the fourth agricultural revolution had been initiated. This article focuses on one part of this high-tech revolution: the origin, development, applications, and user value of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Institutional changes connected to the UAS innovation are analyzed, based on a Swedish case study. The methods included autoethnography. The theoretical frame was composed by four perspectives: innovation, institutions, sustainability, and ethics. UAS can help farmers cut costs and produce higher quantity with better quality, and also has environmental benefits. However, this promising innovation was exposed to institutional forces and suddenly became subordinated the Act of Camera Surveillance. This study illuminates how legislative institutions can inhibit responsible innovation. The study shows that different ethical perspectives can collide with each other.

AB  - 1. Kiruna - A Brand New World (2019) is a documentary film directed by Greta Stocklassa, and produced by the Czech company Analog Vision. It analyses the move of (part of) Kiruna, a north-Swedish mining city, which is threatened by destruction because of the operations of the state-owned ore mining company, Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara (LKAB). The film focusses on the lives of a number of inhabitants, including Timo, a local activist opposing the move, the teenage Sami Maja and Abdalrahman, a teenage refugee from Yemen.
   2. Our discursive-material analysis (see Carpentier, 2017) focusses on how the film represents and intervenes in a discursive-material struggle over the identity of three actors-the soil, the city and the mine-and their interconnections.
   3. The article starts with a theoretical discussion on discourse theory, enriched by new materialist approaches, to develop a theoretical framework that does justice to the discursive-material entanglement.
   4. This framework is then used to identify a hegemonic cluster of discourses that give meaning to nature, consisting of anthropocentrism, dualism and prometheanism, and a counterhegemonic cluster, consisting of ecocentrism, integrationism and survivalism.
   5. The analysis shows that the documentary film shows the workings of the hegemonic cluster (centred around the topoi of progress and TINA), but also visualizes the gaps in, and limits of, this hegemonic cluster. Second, the film also gently highlights the discursive-material conflict by giving voice to those who identify with the counterhegemonic discourses, and by representing the soil as having material agency, resisting its exploitation.

AB  - Traffic safety technologies revolve around two principle ideas; crash avoidance and injury mitigation for inevitable crashes. The development of relevant vehicle injury mitigating technologies should consider the interaction of those two technologies, ensuring that the inevitable crashes can be adequately managed by the occupant and vulnerable road user (VRU) protection systems. A step towards that is the accurate description of the expected crashes remaining when crash-avoiding technologies are available in vehicles. With the overall objective of facilitating the assessment of future traffic safety, this study develops a method for predicting crash configurations when introducing crash-avoiding countermeasures. The predicted crash configurations are one important factor for prioritizing the evaluation and development of future occupant and VRU protection systems. By using real-world traffic accident data to form the baseline and performing counterfactual model-in-the-loop (MIL) pre-crash simulations, the change in traffic situations (vehicle crashes) provided by vehicles with crashavoiding technologies can be predicted. The method is built on a novel crash configuration definition, which supports further analysis of the in-crash phase. By clustering and grouping the remaining crashes, a limited number of crash configurations can be identified, still representing and covering the real-world variation. The developed method was applied using Swedish national- and in-depth accident data related to urban intersections and highway driving, and a conceptual Autonomous Emergency Braking system (AEB) computational model. Based on national crash data analysis, the conflict situations Same-Direction rear-end frontal (SD-ref) representing 53 % of highway vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) crashes, and Straight Crossing Path (SCP) with 21 % of urban v2v intersection crashes were selected for this study. Pre-crash baselines, for SD-ref (n = 1010) and SCP (n = 4814), were prepared based on in-depth accident data and variations of these. Pre-crash simulations identified the crashes not avoided by the conceptual AEB, and the clustering of these revealed 5 and 52 representative crash configurations for the highway SD-ref and urban intersection SCP conflict situations, respectively, to be used in future crashworthiness studies. The results demonstrated a feasible way of identifying, in a predictive way, relevant crash configurations for in-crash testing of injury prevention capabilities.

AB  - Railway transport system is massive and complex, and as such it requires effective maintenance to achieve the business goal of safe, economic and sustainable transportation of passengers and goods. The growing demand for improved service quality and capacity target by railway infrastructure managers requires appropriate maintenance analysis to facilitate continuous improvement of infrastructure performance. This paper presents the application of risk matrix as a maintenance analysis method for the identification of track zones that are bottlenecks that limit operational capacity and quality. Furthermore, an adapted criticality analysis method is proposed to create a hierarchical improvement list for addressing the problem of train mission interruption and reduced operational capacity. A case study of a line section of the Swedish network is presented. The result classifies the zones on the line section into different risk categories based on their contribution to loss of capacity and punctuality. In addition, an improvement list for the lower-level system is presented to facilitate maintenance decisions and continuous improvement at both operational and strategic levels.

AB  - The importance of tree mixtures to the faunal and floral biodiversity of forests has been documented on many occasions, but little is known about the relationships between single-tree effects, such as litter distribution and carabid beetles. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of carabid beetles and the locations of admixed oak trees within a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand. Individuals of four Carabus species were collected in dry pitfall traps in a pine forest with single admixed sessile oaks [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.]. The capture-mark-recapture technique was used to differentiate carabid beetles by species, gender (female, male), and development stage (imagines, larvae). Three zones of influence were defined according to the distribution of oak leaf litter. The beetle counts from trap data were transformed to a point pattern by means of a random-field approach where it is assumed that the beetle count per trap is representative of a specified number of single points in the square surrounding the trap. Spatial patterns specific to species, gender, and development stage were observed relative to the oak tree locations. Females and larvae of C. coriaceus and C. hortensis had a high affinity to the oaks, whereas C. violaceus revealed a negative association to the oak trees. No clear trend could be observed for C. arvensis. It was concluded that single-tree admixtures of oaks affect the spatial patterns of mobile organisms (e.g. Coleoptera) serving as ecological niches in pine forests.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examines the function and use of common spaces in assisted living facilities (ALFs) from the residential and workplace perspectives.
   BACKGROUND: The impact of the physical environment on human activities in healthcare settings has been emphasized in many studies. Few studies, however, have explored the daily use of common spaces and the impact on the usability of ALFs.
   METHODS: Four explorative methods-observation, group interviews, individual interviews, and questionnaires-were used to investigate 14 ALFs in Sweden. The study involves residents, staff, relatives, architects, and people responsible for planning and construction of eldercare. This research strategy combines quantitative and qualitative methods to enhance the validity of the results. Method triangulation and data triangulation were used and the data were analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA).
   RESULTS: The results show that residents and staff have different objectives for use and these differences affect usability, although explicit conflicts are rare. The residents, staff, and other stakeholders have different views about the demarcation of home and workplace and the role of common spaces as venues for social interaction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both the residential and the workplace perspective must be considered when planning assisted living facilities. Otherwise, inherent conflicts between these perspectives will manifest as a result of the physical design. Common spaces have diverse functions that are reflected in their spatial organization. Therefore, ALFs should be designed so the intended function of a specific space is apparent to all users.

AB  - Horse traction in the context of Sweden 1927 and tractor traction in the context of Sweden 1996 were compared in terms of their resource requirements. Flows of energy, material and service from the environment and the economy were identified for the two traction-producing systems, The environmental work and human activity involved in generating necessary inputs for the systems were evaluated on a common basis, using emergy analysis. The main difference between the systems was found in their energy signature. Sixty percent of the horse inputs were renewable, compared with only 9% renewable inputs for the tractor. Ecological technology was replaced by mechanical technology. This represented a shift from a technology that was maintained and driven by mainly locally-generated qualities and driven on local flow-limited renewable sources to a technology controlled and supported by non-local processes and driven on non-renewable sources. A decrease in available fuels and minerals might cause a change in the choice of technology and ecological technology might then be reintroduced into our society as a whole and not only into the agricultural sector. Evaluating management strategies that consider direct and indirect requirements for natural resources from the economic system and 'free' natural resources from the environment currently requires a method able to integrate both. Emergy analysis provides that ability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new Tedania species (Porifera) was collect using remotely operated vehicles during the Canadian mission HUD2010-029 and the British RRS Discovery Cruise DY081, on the Orphan Seamount near the Orphan Knoll, northwest Atlantic, between 2999.88 and 3450.4 m depth. Orphan Knoll is an isolated, drowned continental fragment 550 km northeast Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea. This region is biologically rich and complex and in 2007, the regional fisheries management organization operating in the area regulated that no vessel shall engage in bottom-contact fishing activities until reviewed in 2020 with a review slated at the end of this year. Members of the genus Tedania are uncommon in the temperate northern hemisphere with only six species known previously: Tedania (Tedania) anhelans; Tedania (Tedania) pilarriosae; Tedania (Tedania) suctoria; Tedania (Tedania) urgorrii; Tedania (Tedaniopsis) gurjanovae; and Tedania (Tedaniopsis) phacellina. The particular features of the new sponge we describe are the very peculiar external morphology which is tree-like with dichotomous branching-a morphology not previously described in this subgenus; and the combination of spicules found: long styles, the typical tornotes of the subgenus and two sizes of onychaetes. Additional information is provided on other species of Tedaniopsis described from the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the characteristics reported, we propose a new species, Tedania (Tedaniopsis) rappi sp. nov. in honor of Prof. Hans Tore Rapp (1972-2020), University of Bergen, Norway, a renowned sponge taxonomist and coordinator of the Horizon 2020 SponGES project. The holotype of T. (T.) phacellina Topsent, 1912 from the Azores, the only other northern Atlantic species in the subgenus Tedaniopsis, was reviewed for comparison.

AB  - Since the Age of Enlightenment, modernization has taken the form of a parallel growth of the significance of both the state and the individual, at the expense of the intermediary or secondary groups or collectives of various kinds. With a modern notion of over-burdening and high transaction costs of the mature state and a disrupting alienation of the individual, the search for institutional solutions that are "neither market, nor state," has intensified in both academia and bureaucracies. However, such : efforts often clash with many of the values of modern Western society. In Northern Norway, the political struggle over the reintroduction of Commons Law for Mountain Areas revealed some of these contradictions. This example also shows why many sub-optimal solutions in modern resource management are favored because of the value attached to individual freedom and equal treatment by the state; even when these contradict the sustainable governing of a resource. In contrast, institutional designs based on smaller collectives are perceived as less attractive because they involve less individual freedom, more duties and more inequality. The lessons are used for a discussion of the role of common property institutions in the process of modernisation.

AB  - The ecological consequences of climate change on forest ecosystems have been intensively studied in forest science. In contrast, studies on the economic performance of important tree species that investigate the financial impact of growing those species as monocultures or mixed stands are scarce. We use climate-sensitive survival probabilities to account for natural risk of tree mortality, as well as risk of fluctuating timber prices, to assess the financial performance of spruce and beech stands, pure and mixed, in the context of portfolio theory. We also compare the influence of changing climate to the impact of silvicultural options that forest owners can use to influence financial consequences: pruning spruce and avoiding planting by allowing beech to regenerate naturally. Results show that stands of pure spruce are affected by climate change through reduced mean annuities and increased standard deviation of these annuities. Admixing beech into the stands lowers this shift; by analyzing the displacement vector, we found that 7% share of beech halves the shift and a share of 49% beech reduces the length of the trajectory to 20-25%. However, the changes in risk detected for stands of spruce are relatively low compared to the influence of the silvicultural actions pruning or planting. A sensitivity scenario assuming reduced timber yields for spruce, due to climate change, and slightly increased timber yields for beech resulted massive losses in economic return in stands containing spruce. However, the economic return of spruce-dominated stands was still much higher than that of beech-dominated stands. A small admixture of beech in a spruce-dominated stand led to a comparable economic return compared to a spruce monoculture under all scenarios, with a lower level of risk.

AB  - Ecological drift can override the effects of deterministic niche selection on small populations and drive the assembly of some ecological communities. We tested this hypothesis with a unique data set sampled identically in 200 streams in two regions (tropical Brazil and boreal Finland) that differ in macroinvertebrate community size by fivefold. Null models allowed us to estimate the magnitude to which beta-diversity deviates from the expectation under a random assembly process while taking differences in richness and relative abundance into account, i.e., beta-deviation. We found that both abundance- and incidence-based beta-diversity was negatively related to community size only in Brazil. Also, beta-diversity of small tropical communities was closer to stochastic expectations compared with beta-diversity of large communities. We suggest that ecological drift may drive variation in some small communities by changing the expected outcome of niche selection, increasing the chances of species with low abundance and narrow distribution to occur in some communities. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and reductions in connectivity have been reducing the size of biological communities. These environmental pressures might make smaller communities more vulnerable to novel conditions and render community dynamics more unpredictable. Incorporation of community size into ecological models should provide conceptual and applied insights into a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity.

AB  - Fucus evanescens is a brown alga of arctic origin that has invaded European coasts. The epiphytic community of E evanescens in southern Sweden was compared with that of the native Fucus vesiculosus, to examine to what extent an invading seaweed can modify local biodiversity. F evanescens was much less fouled than E vesiculosus, supporting both less biomass and fewer species of epiphytes. Multivariate analysis of the most common epiphyte taxa showed that the epiphytic community composition of E evanescens was not entirely separated from that of F vesiculosus, but host species contributed significantly to explain the variation in community composition. The biomass of free-living invertebrates was also lower on F evanescens, although the pattern differed between taxonomic groups. While the biomass of amphipods was lower on F evanescens, there was no significant difference in biomass of isopods or gastropods between the Fucus species. The good correlation between biomass of epiphytes and free-living animals suggests that the epiphytes play an important role in providing a suitable habitat for many species of free-living epifauna. The study shows that the invasion of F evanescens affects the environmental conditions for many species associated with the Fucus community but that the direct effect on biodiversity is probably low.

AB  - Recreation benefits constitute a substantial part of the total economic value of forests in modern societies, and are an increasingly important determinant in multi-functional forest management. Heritage sites, such as historic buildings open to visitation, are important parts of some recreation experiences, yet people who do not visit may also view their protection as important. However, few studies have examined the importance of heritage sites as part of the recreational experience or tried to compare their importance for recreational users versus the general public, even though these issues are central to management decisions. In this study, a choice modelling experiment was conducted in Australia to estimate the marginal values for improvements in recreation facilities (trails, day and-night facilities) and historic sites in State plantation forests. The aim of the study was to examine the relative importance of historic sites as an attribute of forest recreation, and explore preference heterogeneity for various attributes of forest recreation across different forest areas and forest users. The results indicate that while there was significant preference heterogeneity for the different recreational attributes at two forest areas, there was less variation in the welfare estimates across attributes, sites and between user and non-user groups. Similar values were identified for the Heritage sites between recreational users and non-users, indicating that protection values were dominant over recreational use; yet no sub-group of the sampled population appeared to value Heritage sites in isolation from recreational assets, suggesting that respondents viewed the forests in multifunctional dimensions.

AB  - Accessibility has conventionally been measured and evaluated ignoring user perceptions in favor of focusing on travel time and distance to a number of pre-determined destinations. Acknowledging this gap, we recently developed a scale for perceived accessibility PAC (Lattman, Friman, & Olsson 2016b) aimed at capturing the individual perspective of accessibility with a certain travel mode. In this paper, we 1) further develop the PAC measure of perceived accessibility in order to capture how easy it is to live a satisfactory life with the help of the transport system, 2) compare levels of perceived accessibility between residential areas and main travel modes, and 3) compare residents' perceived accessibility to the objective accessibility level for the same residential area. Data from 2711 residents of Malmo, Sweden show that perceived accessibility is consistently different from objective accessibility across 13 residential areas, with minor differences in levels of perceived accessibility between areas. Surprisingly, bicycle users rate their accessibility significantly higher than those who mainly use the car or public transport for daily travel, contrary to objective accessibility assumptions. These differences point at the importance of including perceived accessibility as a complementary tool when planning for and evaluating transport systems.

AB  - In Finland, the higher education sector is polarised into academic universities and universities of applied sciences with different tasks and profiles. The higher education especially needs to focus on teaching methods and contents as well as research, development and innovations (R& D& I).
   In Finnish, Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) a new pedagogical approach is rising. In this study, a practical research co-operation between Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences and the local municipalities is described as an example of student-centered collaboration.
   At Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences, many steps have been taken towards reforming the conventional "classroom teaching" pedagogy and implementing the LCCE (R) methodology. This new pedagogical approach provides integration between theoretical lessons and practical exercises in an authentic environment, meaning that students may work with companies and other stakeholders to solve problems or develop new ideas, while being guided by teachers and R&D staff. This methodology is based on the principles of the constructive learning environment and possess the features of the model of integrative pedagogy as well.
   The City of Kotka has a strong emphasis towards sustainable development. The Aalborg Commitment is the frame for the actions taken, such as development of regional climate and energy efficiency strategies as well as sustainable development target plan. At Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences, Energy Technology Engineering education gives competences in environmentally friendly and economical energy production and in innovative energy technology and engineering. One part of the curriculum is Energy Efficiency, including energy audits in all kinds of facilities. The purpose of energy auditing is to analyse the energy use of a particular facility, to define the potential for energy savings and present a profitability calculation of saving proposals.
   In this paper, a concrete co-operation between the energy technology engineering students and staff and the municipality representatives focusing on saving energy and improving energy efficiency in real estates, is described. "Step to Ecosupport" -project was carried out in 2013-2014. Within this project, several energy audits on various targets were implemented by the energy technology engineering students, guided by the academic professional staff and reviewed by the municipal representatives. Both the university students and the staff involved collected knowledge and experiences that are inconceivable to achieve by any other way.

AB  - This paper investigates experiences from implementing an information system that was to support decision-making in managing mobility of students between universities. The process of decision-making varies in every university, bringing challenges to this implementation project. In addition, working in an information technology project has not been familiar to the people representing student affairs offices. This information system was to be piloted in three universities. All Finnish universities signed in 2003 an agreement about allowing students to pass exams in other universities as a part of their master's degree. This agreement comes real by making decisions on rights to study and related issues. Previously there has been no information system to serve these purposes and all information concerning student mobility has been manually mined from diversified files and databases. The research material is collected during the working in the implementation project, using memorandums and emails and personal observations written in a diary.

AB  - Aim To discover how biological traits, ecological preferences and taxonomic relatedness are associated with occupancy and abundance of diatom species across lakes and streams. Location Finland. Taxon Diatoms. Methods We studied 288 diatom species from 492 stream sites and 230 diatom species from 290 lake sites. For each species, we calculated logit-transformed regional occupancy and log-transformed mean local abundance, and further determined biological traits, ecological preferences and taxonomic levels for each species. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis was used to reveal the linear and nonlinear associations of biological, ecological and taxonomic predictors with occupancy or abundance of lake and stream diatoms. Results There were strong and positive interspecific occupancy-abundance relationships across both lakes and streams. The BRT models explained more deviances in variation in occupancy and abundance and their relationship for lakes than streams. Biological traits, especially cell size, but also life-form and guild, were the strongest predictors of diatom occupancy and abundance in lakes and streams when controlling for ecological preferences and taxonomic relatedness. Main conclusions In general, biological traits were the strongest predictors of occupancy and abundance in both freshwater systems. Species with similar biological traits thus tended to show similar occupancies and abundances. As indicated by lower explained deviances, occupancy and abundance in streams seemed to be more complexly structured than in lakes, suggesting that these two freshwater system types differ in the formation of biodiversity patterns. This difference may be related to the differences in hydrological connectedness between lakes and streams. Understanding how variations in species' occupancy and abundance are formed across various waterbodies is important for meaningful biodiversity conservation.

AB  - This paper brings to the fore the importance of a holistic approach to attaining a general pro-environmental behavioural change in order to reduce carbon emissions and the need to strive for a spillover of pro-environmental behaviour from one area to another. An adjusted version of the MaxSEM model is developed to capture differences in stages of behavioural change regarding environmental load on entering a Mobility Management campaign and one year after. The analytical tool is applied on two test samples in order to illustrate the tool and possible difficulties and methodological challenges. The test samples consist of participants in Mobility Management campaigns with personal incentives in two cities in Sweden. The application of the tool indicates e.g. that the timing of the survey is important and that there is need to upscale the MM-campaigns, in order to further discuss and analyse the effects of voluntary mobility measures in other domains.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic contributors of phosphorus (P) to surface waters and reducing these P loads is a target set by many countries. One potential mitigation strategy could be to utilize biochar, functionalized by co-precipitating metal ions onto its surface to adsorb phosphates. We evaluated such an approach in a series of laboratory experiments and a three-year field lysimeter study. Leached phosphates were trapped in a 3-cm layer of a commercially available 20% hardwood/80% Norway spruce biochar, coated with magnetite and placed under the soil root zone. Langmuir maximum adsorption potential (Qmax) was 3.38 mg P g(-1) biochar, as determined from batch adsorption studies performed at pH 6.5. Further laboratory experiments revealed that adsorption was strongly negatively correlated with pH (R-2 = 0.995). In a laboratory column study using high flow rates, no difference was found in phosphate adsorption between coated biochar and the control (no biochar), after application of ammonium phosphate at a rate corresponding to 22 kg P ha(-1). However, differences were observed at higher application rates (285 or 570 kg P ha(-1)). Calculation of a Fe:P molar ratio to evaluate the magnetite treatment method from laboratory (2:1) to lysimeter (248:1) suggested a relatively effective laboratory performance, but overall poor field efficiency. Nevertheless, biochar in the lysimeter study still reduced phosphate leaching from two organic soils, by 62% (P < 0.05) and 35% (NS). This suggests that, even though the method of magnetite-coating biochar is not necessarily resource-efficient, it is effective in removing P from soil leachate.

AB  - Research on multiuser perceptions of street environment alterations has been gathering attention in recent years given an increased focus on both sustainable city development and public participation. This study investigated the value of applying a mixed-methods approach to investigating user perceptions of Complete Streets projects. It employed an online survey of 719 users of a case study street in Trondheim, Norway which received an interim infrastructural treatment including a road diet and a separated bicycle path. The survey presented the reospondents with manipulated photographs showing the implemented interim design solution and six different potential streetscape configurations in order to explore their street design preferences. Additionally, the use of an integrated mapping application programming interface (API) allowed the participants to place markers with comments along the project map to explain where and why they had felt unsafe in relation to their use of the street before and after the implementation of the interim street modification, although both were collected in the after period. The ability of users' demographic characteristics and transport behavior to explain variations in perceptions and preferences was explored. It was confirmed that the participants favored separated bicycle path designs and that their preferences did not vary considerably among the different user types. The analysis of the distribution of the unsafe points from both time periods helped in the identification of traffic safety issues that might not have been uncovered if only stated preference methodologies were used. Additionally, it was shown that implementing such street alternations as interim projects could be beneficial for the planning process by providing the planners with insights on the way changes to the street environment would be experienced by the users.

AB  - SANBALTS (Simple As Necessary Baltic Long-Term Large-Scale) is a model of the coupled nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. This model has been developed as an integral part of the decision support system Marine Research on Eutrophication's Nest with the overall aim to evaluate management options for reducing Baltic Sea eutrophication. Simulated nutrient and oxygen concentrations as well as transport flows and major biogeochemical fluxes can be analyzed in many different ways, including construction of detailed nutrient budgets and tracing the fate of nutrient inputs. The large amounts of data that exist for this sea makes it possible to validate model results with observations. Major biogeochemical properties of the Baltic Sea are discussed through an analyses of model sensitivity to external forcing and internal parameterizations. Model results emphasize two features that are especially important for ecosystem management: i) impacts of local measures would always be modified by the long-range transports from other regions and ii) the response to significant changes in loads would only be seen after several decades.

AB  - The purpose of the EU energy policy is to provide "secure, affordable and sustainable energy supplies", relying on an integrated electricity market, security of supply, and clean energy. In practice this means ambitious long term renewable energy targets in EU for 2030 and 2050 and ambitions to improve the energy grid across Europe. A significant share of the renewable energy development in EU is expected to take place in the North Sea. Coping with large shares of variable renewable energy in the North Sea calls for ambitious development of transmission capacity and interconnections between North Sea countries. We analyse what kind of grid infrastructure supports the renewable generation development in most efficiently: the integrated approach, or the conventional individual solution. We find that an early development of the transmission grid in an integrated configuration offers the most cost-efficient solution leading to decreasing electricity prices in most countries except Norway.

AB  - We studied the effects of small-scale disturbance on breeding, forest passerine birds in an old-growth and managed boreal forests in northern Finland. Small-scale disturbance (< 2 ha) in an old-growth and managed forests originated from wind falls and small clear cuts. Continuous forest without gaps was used as a control for both management types (old-growth and managed forests). Passerines' response to disturbance was examined by estimating species richness and abundance of different ecological groups. Species richness and the total abundance of birds did not differ between gap and non-gap plots, neither did the abundance of most ecological groups. Management type or study year were the most important factors explaining abundances. Our results differ from studies conducted in temperate forests, mainly in North America, where small-scale disturbance have been found to increase avian diversity and abundance. Differences between boreal and temperate forests or in avian assemblages between continents may explain observed differences.

AB  - Within the sustainability transitions literature, established, mature or incumbent firms have been stereotyped as `locked-in' to socio-technical regimes. However, we believe regimes have been black-boxed, and few studies have explored incumbents' responses to transition processes. This article aims to achieve an improved understanding of incumbents in established energy sectors and their extent of involvement in other (niche) energy sectors. To this avail, we analyze data from a first-of-its-kind survey of 133 incumbent firms in Norway's two main energy sectors, namely oil/gas and hydropower. Providing inter-temporal dimensions, our data covers incumbents' diversification activities beyond their primary sector both in the past (cancelled activities), present (ongoing activity in secondary sectors) and future (ambitions of diversification), and also distinguishes between producers and product/service suppliers. By incorporating insights on firm diversification, our analysis sheds new light on the complex transformation processes associated with sustainability transitions. Empirical results show considerable heterogeneity in incumbents' responses to changing selection pressures, which can be explained by recognition that windows of opportunity are opening and some incumbents see potential to leverage their resources and capabilities to capture value in new niche energy sectors in both domestic and international markets.

CP  - 3rd International Symposium on the Protection of the Environment from Ionising Radiation (SPEIR 3)
AB  - A total of 15 organisations (including regulators, research institutes and industry) in seven European countries (Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and UK) are collaborating on creating a Framework for ASSessment of Environmental impacT (FASSET) of ionising radiation. The project aims at developing approaches and tools for assessing impact on biota and ecosystems, and to support efforts to protect the environment from harmful effects of radiation. The project is supported by the European Union through the EC 5th Framework Programme, and is due to end in October 2003.
   The Project is divided into four work packages. In WP2, seven European ecosystems are considered in the assessments; three aquatic (marine, brackish, freshwater) and four terrestrial (seminatural ecosystems including pasture, agricultural ecosystems, wetlands and forests). A list of candidate generic reference organisms has been drawn up on the basis of expert judgement of exposure situations in the selected ecosystems. These organisms are considered references or 'surrogates' for existing biota in the natural habitat. They serve as starting points for development of dosimetric models, being developed in WP 1, and for pooling available information on ecological relevance and biological effects. Further analysis of the candidate reference organisms is performed to justify their choice and assess their applicability in different situations, taking into account modelling of radionuclide transfer, estimates of internal and external dose rates, ecological significance and biological effects.
   WP3 considers general 'umbrella' effects that, when manifested in an individual, may have an impact at population level or at higher levels of the organisational hierachy. The four categories are: morbidity (fitness or well-being), mortality (death directly attributable to radiation), reproductive success (changed number of offspring) and scorable cytogenetic effects (molecular actions, aberrations, etc.). A database is being assembled, compiling data from the literature for a number of organism categories for each of these four umbrella effects. The database also considers the suitability of data to derive RBE for different types of radiation.
   The work from the three WPs on exposure., dosimetry and effects will be organised into a framework for impact assessments, which will take into account experience from application of ecotoxicological approaches in assessing effects of other hazardous substances (carried out in WP 4). Characterisation of risks will be performed in a way that attempts to make the framework useful to regulators, for demonstration of compliance, and for communication with the public and decision-makers.
   The latest development in the project will be presented. The progress of the project can be followed on its website, www.fasset.org.

AB  - Urban riverside parks are important habitats for fall wildlife, but the relationship between birds and habitats in highly urbanized areas is unclear. Our study was to explore relationship with avian species and habitat factors. From October to November (fall of 2021), we studied 34 park transects in urban Fuzhou, China using remote sensing and field observations. We analyzed the data using Pearson, stepwise regression, and RDA. Woodland bird diversity was negatively correlated with water area and bare ground. Waterbird diversity positively associated with water area but negatively affected by landscape diversity and woodland proportions. Woodland areas primarily determined omnivorous bird composition. Waterbird species were positively influenced by water area but negatively impacted by woodland, grassland areas, and distance to the riverbank. Landscape factors had a greater influence on woodland birds, waterbirds, residency types, and feeding bird communities, while spatial factors had a smaller impact. Our research highlights that efforts to create bird habitats in highly urban areas should prioritize managing landscape factors to better match avian preferences in habitat creation and conservation.

AB  - Animals continuously interact with their environment through behavioral decisions, rendering the appropriate choice of movement speed and directionality an important phenotypic trait. Anthropogenic activities may alter animal behavior, including movement. A detailed understanding of movement decisions is therefore of great relevance for science and conservation alike. The study of movement decisions in relation to environmental and seasonal cues requires continuous observation of movement behavior, recently made possible by high-resolution telemetry. We studied movement traits of 13 capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a mainly ground-moving forest bird species of conservation interest, over two summer seasons in a Swedish windfarm using high-resolution GPS tracking data (5-min sampling interval). We filtered and removed unreliable movement steps using accelerometer data and step characteristics. We explored variation in movement speed and directionality in relation to environmental and seasonal covariates using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). We found evidence for clear daily and seasonal variation in speed and directionality of movement that reflected behavioral adjustments to biological and environmental seasonality. Capercaillie moved slower when more turbines were visible and faster close to turbine access roads. Movement speed and directionality were highest on open bogs, lowest on recent clear-cuts (<5 y.o.), and intermediate in all types of forest. Our results provide novel insights into the seasonal and environmental correlates of capercaillie movement patterns and supplement previous behavioral observations on lekking behavior and wind turbine avoidance with a more mechanistic understanding.

AB  - The effect of harvesting biofuel and woodland restoration on biodiversity is debated. To evaluate the effects of partial cutting on more organism groups, we used pairwise experimental and undisturbed control stands in a large landscape. On average 26% of the basal area including 50-95% of the understorey was harvested at each of 15 oak-rich forest sites. Our earlier results of partial cutting suggested a positive short-term effect for vascular plants and beetles and no or minor negative effects for fungi. Here we analyse the response of mycetophilids (Diptera: Sciaroidea excl. Sciaridae), a neglected but species-rich insect group that was strongly disfavoured by clear-cutting in previous studies. Increased deadwood (slash) caused increase in the number of individuals of mycetophilids associated with wood or wood fungi. The rarefaction species numbers of mycetophilids declined after the treatment, but the absolute number of species was not affected. Our results indicate that a 25% harvest can be compatible with conservation of vascular plants, fungi, saproxylic and herbivorous beetles and mycetophilids in temperate hardwood stands of the type studied. However, more studies are needed to determine what level(s) of stand thinning can be tolerated by different taxa in landscapes with small fragmented conservation stands.

AB  - This study compares the environmental performances of two protein sources for aquafeed production: Brazilian soy protein and Norwegian seaweed protein concentrates. The efficiency and sustainability of these two production systems are assessed using a comparative material and substance flow analysis accounting for the transfers of primary energy and phosphorus. The primary energy and phosphorus demand of 1 t of soy protein concentrate is compared to 2 t seaweed protein concentrate to assess commodities with similar protein contents. The primary energy consumption of the latter protein source (172,133 MJ) is found 11.68 times larger than for the soy-based concentrate (14,733 MJ). However, the seaweed protein energy requirement can be reduced to 34,010 MJ if secondary heat from a local waste incineration plant is used to dry the biomass during the late-spring harvest. The seaweed system outperformed the soy system regarding mineral phosphorus consumption since 1 t of soy protein requires 25.75 kg mineral phosphorus while 2 t of seaweed protein require as little as 0.008 kg input. These results indicate that substituting soy protein with seaweed protein in aquafeed leads to an environmental trade-off. The seaweed value chain produces proteins with near zero mineral phosphorus consumption by using naturally occurring marine phosphorus while the soy value-chain produces proteins for roughly 1/12th of the primary energy required by seaweed. Based on the current production technology, the seaweed value-chain will require extensive innovation and economies of scale to become energy competitive. Further research should investigate the predictive environmental impacts of a fully developed seaweed protein concentrate value-chain and account for the background emissions and multi-functionality in each system.

AB  - Game meat, one of man's main sources of food in prehistoric times, now plays a relatively modest role in total food and meat consumption in most parts of the world. However, in Europe, notably in East, Central and Northern Europe, wildlife is still of considerable importance. In some countries, especially Germany, the overall output of hunted game has increased during the past several decades. The increase has been mainly with deer of various species and wild boar, whereas the population of hares and wild birds has generally decreased. In several European and overseas countries the supply of hunted game has more recently been supplemented by venison from fallow and red deer and other meats from a rapidly expanding game farming sector. Germany and Sweden keep the largest populations of farmed game in Europe. However, the forerunner of commercial deer farming has been New Zealand which keeps over a million deer, approximately half of the world's stock of farmed game animals. New Zealand has also become the leading exporter of game meat. Other major suppliers are Argentina, Australia, Poland and other countries of Central and East Europe. The largest import market is the European Union, with Germany, France, Italy and Sweden accounting for the bulk of EU imports. Prices of game meat, both hunted and farmed, are generally well above those of domestic animals. Consumption its very unevenly distributed among the various groups of population. In fact, in North America and West Europe hunters and their acquaintance consume a very large portion of total local supplies. Game farming and ranching is expected to continue its worldwide expansion, whereas the natural habitat for wildlife is shrinking, especially in developing countries. All in all, game meat will remain relatively small in global meat production, consumption and trade.

AB  - The only National Inventory of red wood ants in Bulgaria was carried out about 50 years ago (1970-1973). Formica rufa Linnaeus, 1761, F. pratensis Retzius, 1783, F. lugubris Zetterstedt, 1838 and F. polyctena (as F. polyctena x rufa hybrid) were found in a current monitoring programme. This study presents data on their current distribution and nest density, and provides more details about the habitat requirements for conservation purposes. Field studies were carried out by the transect method along the main mountainous areas in Bulgaria. We found 256 nests of red wood ants along 172 transects. The most abundant species was F. lugubris, followed by F. rufa and F. pratensis. Among the environmental variables, the elevation, exposure, ecological groups of plants, stone cover, grass cover, canopy cover and forest age appeared as significantly related to the presence and nest density of red wood ants.

AB  - Landscape research offers fruitful perspectives on interactions between society and nature. We suggest that animals may help us to understand these interactions in their full complexity. We examine the constitutive role of animals in society-nature interactions through a case study of brown bears entering a semi-urban landscape of second homes in south-eastern Finland, and developing a garbage-eating habit. Drawing from relational thinking and poststructuralist geographies, we analyse the landscape as co-produced by humans and bears. Analysis of the material and socio-cultural practices of cohabitation enriches the understanding of society-nature interactions by emphasising the open-endedness of the interactions. Therefore, the identification of the underlying material interactions makes visible alternative ways of living the landscape and provides means to evaluate spatial strategies with which problematic society-nature interactions can be manipulated.

AB  - The city of Loviisa in Finland is planning a new sustainable residential area with a total of 240,000 m(2) of residential houses and apartment buildings with services. The city wants to promote sustainable energy solutions in the area, considering various renewable energy forms for heating. The aim of this research is to evaluate which heating system would be best for a new single-family house when different technical, economic, environmental and usability criteria are considered. A group of experts evaluated the alternative heating systems with respect to the criteria. The citizens were involved with a questionnaire to provide preference information for different criteria. Altogether 11 alternative heating systems were evaluated in terms of 15 criteria. The Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) method was used to analyze this problem. The SMAA method was extended to handle a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria. The problem was analyzed in two phases based on expert evaluation for the criteria measurements first without the preference information from citizens and after this with the information. The results show that district heating produced by biomass based CHP is the most widely acceptable heating alternative followed by ground source heat pump both without and with preference information.

AB  - The composition of municipal wastewater and sewage sludge reflects the use and proliferation of elements and contaminants within society. In Sweden, official statistics show that concentrations of toxic metals in municipal sewage sludge have steadily decreased, by up to 90 %, since the 1970s, due to environmental programmes and statutory limits on metals in sludge and soil. Results from long-term field experiments show that reduced metal pollution during repeated sewage sludge application has reversed negative trends in soil biology. Despite this Swedish success story, organic waste recycling from Swedish towns and cities to arable land is still limited to only about 20 % of the total amount produced. Resistance among industries and consumers to products grown on land treated with sewage sludge may not always be scientifically grounded; however, there are rational obstacles to application of sewage sludge to land based on its inherent properties rather than its content of pollutants. We argue that application of urban organic wastes to soil is an efficient form of recycling for small municipalities, but that organic waste treatment from large cities requires other solutions. The large volumes of sewage sludge collected in towns and cities are not equitably distributed back to arable land because of the following: (i) The high water and low nutrient content in sewage sludge make long-distance transportation too expensive; and (ii) the low plant availability of nutrients in sewage sludge results in small yield increases even after many years of repeated sludge addition. Therefore, nutrient extraction from urban wastes instead of direct organic waste recycling is a possible way forward. The trend for increased combustion of urban wastes will make ash a key waste type in future. Combustion not only concentrates the nutrients in the ash but also leads to metal enrichment; hence, direct application of the ash to land is most often not possible. However, inorganic fertiliser (e.g. mono-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, MAP) can be produced from metalcontaminated sewage sludge ash in a process whereby the metals are removed. We argue that the view on organic waste recycling needs to be diversified in order to improve the urban-rural nutrient cycle, since only recycling urban organic wastes directly is not a viable option to close the urban-rural nutrient cycle. Recovery and recycling of nutrients from organic wastes are a possible solution. When organic waste recycling is complemented by nutrient extraction, some nutrient loops within society can be closed, enabling more sustainable agricultural production in future.

AB  - 1. Functional diversity (FD) as a biodiversity measure has an explicit role in ecosystem functioning because the effects of environmental changes in ecosystems are determined by biological functions, such as feeding type and trophic position, of particular species.
   2. We evaluated the usability of functional characterization and FD of an aquatic keystone group (Crustacea: Cladocera) for enhancing the understanding of long-term lake functional responses to environmental changes. The aims were to separate ecologically significant functional groups, investigate succession of such functional groups during nutrient enrichment process and determine the relationship between FD and lake productivity using a palaeolimnological approach.
   3. We selected two eutrophicated study lakes from southern Finland for down-core investigations, one with a centennial (past c. 350 years) and the other with a decadal (past c. 70 years) nutrient enrichment record. Cladoceran microfossils in the sediment cores were used to determine the taxonomic structure of the past communities. Ecologically relevant functional characteristics were determined to separate functional groups by utilizing a functional dendrogram and a weighted community-based FD index together with a set of multidimensional FD indices. The indices were applied to the down-core assemblages.
   4. The functional dendrogram separated cladocerans into functional groups where habitat type principally separated open-water filterers and predators from epibenthic scrapers and detritivores. Further separation in the pelagic branch was based on body size and feeding and among the benthic branch body shape.
   5. Functional assemblages changed markedly during the nutrient enrichment process. In the early stage of eutrophication, the largest functional changes were caused by small planktonic filterers and predators. Small filterers and epibenthos responded strongest during the eutrophic-hypereutrophic succession. FD had a positive long-term relationship with lake trophic status until eutrophic conditions that was likely caused by diversifying resources and versatile food webs. Under hypereutrophic conditions, and especially at a decadal temporal resolution, alternating predation regimes caused variance to FD.
   6. In the current records, cladoceran FD was positively related to lake productivity and bottom-up controls during the early stages of eutrophication in the long-term record but top-down controls apparently were more important at a decadal scale and under hypereutrophic conditions.

AB  - According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, overcapacity in the fishing fleet poses a fundamental challenge in fisheries. Overcapacity leads to an increased pressure on fish stocks and a decrease in economic profit. The fishing fleet is marginalised economically, and overcapacity creates allocation conflicts between different gear and vessel groups. In addition, the expenses to control and management increase. Although Norwegian authorities have introduced several restrictions, for example total allowable catch, licenses, vessel quotas, and other regulatory measures, this article shows that the problems connected to overcapacity persist. Analyses of the technical capacity development show that there is an overall capacity expansion although the number of vessels is reduced. This development is an indicator of the dynamics of technological development over time, and the article discusses whether the concept of technology is sufficiently integrated into fisheries management. The important question now is whether analyses of the technical capacity development can serve as a positive supplement to the traditional fisheries management, which largely is based on input from the scientific disciplines biology and economics.

AB  - In soil organic carbon (SOC) survey, the role of sampling approach is crucial and should not be underestimated. In this sense, the appropriateness of soil sampling by pedogenic horizons (PGH) and fixed depth layers (FDL) in forest is still a field of debate. The present work aimed to: (a) study the spatial variability of SOC concentrations and C stocks through PGH and FDL samplings in uneven-aged sweet chestnut, European beech and Norway spruce forests of the Apennine chain (Italy); (b) clarify the major advantages and drawbacks of sampling by PGH and FDL. In a representative area (18 x 18 m) of each forest, a soil profile was investigated and eight additional sampling points were selected. The sampling was performed both by PGH and FDL (0-15 and 15-30 cm). For each forest, no SOC content and C stock differences in 0-30 cm soil depth were found between PGH (58.8 +/- 5.3 g kg(-1) and 103 +/- 7 g ha(-1), respectively) and FDL (52.7 +/- 4.3 g kg(-1) and 117 +/- 9 Mg ha(-1), respectively) sampling. However, under Norway spruce, PGH sampling pointed-out that C was mainly stored in Oe and Oa horizons (51.1 vs. 146 Mg ha(-1) in the 0-30 cm layer). The higher coefficient of variation obtained when soil horizons were considered (from 19.2% to 72.8% for PGH and from 16.5% to 25.7% for FDL) suggested that PGH sampling preserved the information about the spatial variability within an ecosystem. The information loss about SOC vertical and spatial distribution would indicate the inability of FDL sampling to support decision-making plans addressed for sustainable use of soil resource.

AB  - Translocation of captive-bred animals has become a widespread conservation practice to counteract species extinctions. We analyse and discuss the apparent success and shortcomings of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) rein-troductions in alpine tundra areas of Norway. We followed the fate of 915 foxes between 2007 and 2020 and estimated the apparent survival and reproductive success of captive-bred and released Arctic foxes, compared to wild-born descendants. Relationship to abundance of small rodents, population size, and age were explored. Overall, apparent survival and probability of breeding were similar between captive-bred and wild-born foxes, positively linked to rodent abundance. For wild-born foxes, both breeding propensity and litter size declined with increasing fox population size. This could be a first sign of the limited capacity of single tundra patches to house self-subsistent populations. Thus, facilitating and maintaining connectivity among remnant and re-established Arctic fox populations, creating functional metapopulations, is essential for further improvement and long-term survival. Relying on the combined measures of supplementary feeding and red-fox (Vulpes vulpes) con-trol, the Arctic fox captive-breeding and reintroduction programme has so far been highly successful. However, anthropogenic drivers facilitating red fox invasion into the Arctic fox habitat, along with climate driven irreg-ularities and dampened small rodent cycles, could inhibit the establishment of a self-sustained population. A more holistic ecosystem approach and conservation measures to restore alpine fauna should be considered.

AB  - All vascular plants, classified by life and growth form into aquatic species (hydrophytes and helophytes) and terrestrial species of pond margins, were inventoried in 64 SE Norwegian agricultural landscape ponds and their adjacent margins for which also 56 explanatory variables were recorded. Gradients in species composition, found separately for aquatic and terrestrial species by parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations, were interpreted by correlation and geostatistical analyses.
   The main gradients in species composition given by the first DCA ordination axes for aquatic and terrestrial species were strongly correlated, and both were related to water chemical and geographical variables. The second gradient in aquatic species composition was only weakly related to explanatory variables while for terrestrial species the second axis (like the first) was related to geographical, water chemical and some anthropological impact variables. The spatial structure of most explanatory variables was relatively weak, with a range of influence of 3-6 km.
   Species composition gradients and species richness variation of the investigated ponds and pond margins were thus to a large extent explained by the same variables. Like species richness, species composition was relatively weakly related to recorded explanatory variables. These two main characteristics of the investigated ecosystem thus both underpin the view that apparent randomness is important in this ecosystem and that ponds and their adjacent margins represent islands in the agricultural landscape that accumulate species more or less individualistically.

AB  - This paper explains a growing function in today's public organizations: the technostructure. It reports on the outcomes of an educational programme to develop teams comprising HR, financial and organizational development managers in a Swedish municipality in order to achieve joint support to line managers. The three groups emphasized the importance of their dissimilar work areas and their differences vis-a-vis other administrative occupations with presumably simpler tasks, and showed their indispensability. The groups' relations were strengthened, but not their actual joint support to line managers. The paper contributes to the literature on professionalized technostructures and organizational change.

AB  - Despite that the study of individual repeatability is a common topic in behavioral ecology, virtually nothing is known about inter-annual variability in the marine migratory behavior of iteroparous salmonids that can complete multiple feeding migrations in their lifespan. Behavioral data from 38 anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta), tracked by acoustic telemetry in 2-3 consecutive marine feeding migrations in two Norwegian fjord systems, were analyzed for intra-individual repeatability in key aspects of their marine migration. Individual brown trout displayed significant inter-annual consistency in marine area use and in the timing of marine exit (i.e. when they returned to spawning rivers), but not in the timing of marine entry or the time spent in the marine environment each year. Our study raises new questions about how anadromous brown trout respond to changing conditions and anthropogenic factors in the marine environment. Intra-individual repeatability of brown trout linked to changing environmental conditions should therefore be a focus for future studies.

AB  - This article is based on a dynamic initiative that should help realize the Norwegian government inter-ministry action plan "Entrepreneurship in Education - from elementary school to higher education 2009-2014". The primary focus is directed towards the implementation of entrepreneurship - or entrepreneurial learning - within compulsory education. The project, however, is also intended to develop entrepreneurial key skills and a force for renewal as contributory factors to the development of tomorrow's schooling and society. The development of versatile learning arenas and varied learning environments with local and regional roots are essential tools for this work. By renewing the best qualities of the existing compulsory education sector and by further development of the learning arenas of both school and university the project will contribute to the deployment of creative, experimental and enquiry-led forms of work. At the same time, relevant research-based patterns of work must be used to ensure renewal and to promote creative and motivational projects both in compulsory education and in teacher training. This research project's contribution to the work will include the development of alternative learning environments in which educational institutions collaborate with local bodies: companies, cultural and social institutions. In this way the research project will be a means of developing the school sector as a contemporary and geographically-relevant learning organisation and of strengthening the skills of teacher training as a participatory force in local society. The intention is to develop an entrepreneurial pedagogy that in the short term will strengthen the pupils' desire for activity, desire for learning and their motivation, but which will also promote their long-term development and professional skills. The research project is rooted in the research - group for Entrepreneurship in Education at the University of Nordland. We wish to highlight the creative and innovative strength that this newly established university can offer. Skills developed through previous project participation are also taken into use in this new project through developing the learning culture of compulsory education. The project will also use web-based learning and communication forms - "blended learning".

AB  - Our current knowledge of the P retention efficiency of peatland buffer zone areas used to reduce sediment and nutrient leaching from forestry areas is insufficient. Especially the role of P sorption by soil in buffer zones needs closer examination as there is considerable variation in the efficiency of P retention. Six sites in southern Finland were chosen for the study. The buffer zone areas varied between 0.1-4.9% of the catchment area. A total of 10 kg of solute PO4-P was added to the inflow of the buffer zone areas and the concentrations of PO4-P in inflow and outflow were measured for 2-4 years. P retention characteristics of the surface peat were determined with sorption-desorption isotherms before and after PO4-P addition and the effective buffer zone area over which the added P was spread was determined from soil water samples. P retention in the two largest buffer zone areas was complete (100% retention), and the third largest buffer retained 94%. Retention in the three smallest buffer zones was 24%, 95% and 95% of the added P. As a result of P addition reduction in peat P retention capacity was detected in three out of four cases. The effective buffer zone area varied from 67% to 100% of the total buffer zone area. Factors contributing to efficient P retention were large buffer size and low hydrological load whereas high hydrological load combined with the formation of preferential flow paths, especially during early spring or late autumn was disadvantageous. High P retention capacity in peat contributed to the sustainability of P retention. The study showed that even relatively small buffer zone areas are able to efficiently reduce P load.

AB  - Many invasive species are expanding northwards into boreal and subarctic habitats, but research on the factors favoring their establishment in these regions remains limited. In three Swedish lakes we investigated the growth of Elodea canadensis Michx, a highly invasive macrophyte that is spreading northwards in Europe and Alaska. We conducted an in situ growth experiment, maintained for ten months, in concert with two field macrophyte surveys, undertaken in summer and spring. We further compared the performance of propagules established during summer with those established under less favorable conditions in late autumn. We found that E. canadensis grew throughout the autumn, followed by winter dieback, with regrowth occurring early in the spring when water temperatures remained under 5 degrees C. Elodea canadensis plants were frequently found in our spring field survey, soon after ice melt, when almost all other species were still dormant. In the growth experiment, growth of individual shoots was positively associated with key abiotic variables (especially alkalinity) and also with increasing cover of E. canadensis. The tendency of propagule shoots to fragment from the main stems was also positively associated with increasing E. canadensis length and ambient population cover. Although propagules established in November initially did worse the following spring than those established in August, by the start of the following summer both groups were growing equally well, and had converged in morphology. The growth of E. canadensis throughout autumn and its early re-growth in spring, the capacity of propagules established even in late autumn to regrow well the following year, and the apparently self-reinforcing effect of increasing local population size on shoot growth all have the potential to benefit E. canadensis as it spreads north into boreal and subarctic regions.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, our oceans have gradually become warmer and more acidic. To better understand the consequences of this, there is a need for long-term (months) and multistressor experiments. Earlier research demonstrates that the effects of global climate change are specific to species and life stages. We exposed berried Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus), during 4months to the combination of six ecologically relevant temperatures (5-18 degrees C) and reduced pH (by 0.4 units). Embryonic responses were investigated by quantifying proxies for development rate and fitness including: % yolk consumption, mean heart rate, rate of oxygen consumption, and oxidative stress. We found no interactions between temperature and pH, and reduced pH only affected the level of oxidative stress significantly, with a higher level of oxidative stress in the controls. Increased temperature and % yolk consumed had positive effects on all parameters except on oxidative stress, which did not change in response to temperature. There was a difference in development rate between the ranges of 5-10 degrees C (Q(10): 5.4) and 10-18 degrees C (Q(10): 2.9), implicating a thermal break point at 10 degrees C or below. No thermal limit to a further increased development rate was found. The insensitivity of N. norvegicus embryos to low pH might be explained by adaptation to a pH-reduced external habitat and/or internal hypercapnia during incubation. Our results thus indicate that this species would benefit from global warming and be able to withstand the predicted decrease in ocean pH in the next century during their earliest life stages. However, future studies need to combine low pH and elevated temperature treatments with hypoxia as hypoxic events are frequently and increasingly occurring in the habitat of benthic species.

AB  - In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methods were applied for the new city district of Hiedanranta, where source-separating sanitation systems are being considered. Two source-separating systems were compared to the conventional sanitation system with a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). With a separating system, three to 10 times more nitrogen could be recovered compared to the conventional system. If the nutrient potential of the reject water of the sludge digestion were to be utilized, the recovery rate would be even higher. For phosphorus, the recovered amount would be at the same level for all the alternatives. However, the plant availability of phosphorus is higher in separating systems. Based on the environmental impacts of separating systems with improved nutrient recovery, the climate and eutrophication impacts could be reduced, but the acidification impact may be higher. However, the actual climate benefits depend on how the avoided emissions will be realized, which is highly dependent on the policy and decision-making processes in the society. The life cycle costs of the alternative source-separating systems are higher at current prices. Source-separating sanitation produces new recycled nutrient products of human origin that contain fewer contaminants and could therefore be more easily accepted for end use when certain boundary conditions are met.

AB  - Sannas Fjord is a shallow fjord (<32 m w.d.) with a sill depth of 8 m, located at the Swedish west coast of the Skagerrak (North Sea). The anthropogenic impact on the fjord represents combination of sewage from the local village of Sannas and land run-off from agricultural areas. Sewage impact has been reduced since 1991 and today the fjord is included into several nature conservation programs administrated by the European Union. Yet, observations during the summers of 2008-2011 show that the shallow inner fjord inlet experiences severe oxygen depletion at 5-12 m water depth. To explore if the oxygen depletion is only a recent phenomenon and to evaluate the potential of fjord sediments to archive such environmental changes, in 2008 and 2009 seven sediment cores were taken along a transect oriented lengthwise in the fjord. The cores were analysed for organic carbon, C/N, benthic foraminifera and lead pollution records (as relative age marker). Carbon content increases in most of the cores since the similar to 1970-80s, while C/N ratio decreases from the core base upward since similar to 1995. Foraminiferal assemblages in most core stratigraphies are dominated by agglutinated species. Calcareous species (mainly elphidiids) have become dominant in the upper part of the records since the similar to late 1990s or 2000 (the inner fjord and the deepest basin) and since the similar to 1950-70s (the outer fjord). In the inner Sannas Fjord, an increase of agglutinated foraminiferal species (e.g. Eggerelloides scaber) and organic inner linings occurred since the similar to 1970s, suggesting an intensification of taphonomic processes affecting postmortem calcareous shell preservation. A study of living vs. dead foraminiferal assemblages undertaken during June-August 2013 demonstrates that in the shallow inner fjord, strong carbonate dissolution occurs within 1-3 months following the foraminiferal growth. The dissolution is linked to corrosive conditions present within the sediment - bottom water interface, and is likely caused by the organic matter decay, resulting in severe hypoxia to anoxia. Oxygen depletion at <10 m w.d. develops fast due to the small water volume and limited bottom water exchange caused by a close proximity of pycnocline to the fjord bottom. Sediment cores from the deep fjord basin and the outer fjord are, on the contrary, characterized by good to excellent preservation of foraminiferal shells, higher sediment accumulation rates, and the greatest potential for high-resolution paleoenvironmental studies. Increased frequencies of low-oxygen tolerant species (e.g. Stainforthia fusiformis) in the outer fjord after similar to the 1970s suggests that increased primary productivity and seasonal oxygen deficiency have existed in the area over the last century. Recent milder winters, absent sediment reworking by freezing and grounding of sea-ice, increased nutrient load due to higher precipitation and land run-off, and the luxuriant growth of filamentous green algae followed by the organic matter decay are discussed among the mechanisms driving formation of recent oxygen deficiency in the shallow fjord inlets.

AB  - The pathway to a sustainable society is not clear, and we need to consider different developmental possibilities. This paper describes the results of a research project in the intersection of HCI and Futures Studies as well as in the intersection between "the future information society" and sustainability.
   We here present parts of the body of materials that were developed in a multi-year research project with the aim of describing and evaluating the sustainability impact of possible future information societies. We also discuss some of the lessons learned and what HCI and design fiction can learn from Futures Studies in general and from this project in particular. The main stakeholders in this project have been city administrators and corporate partners, and the overarching goal has primarily been to influence planning processes at the regional (Stockholm, Sweden) level.

AB  - Ecosystem Health takes the health concept to a new dimension. Traditionally the concept of health has been restricted to individuals and populations. However, it has become apparent that ecosystems also can become dysfunctional, particularly under stress from human activity The International Society for Ecosystem Health has provided a forum for the evolution of methods of assessing ecosystem health, and for applications to environmental management. This emerging field requires collaboration from many areas, including importantly, the earth sciences. In this paper we articulate the concept of ecosystem health, review the history of the International Society and illustrate the role of the earth sciences in ecosystem rehabilitation with a case study from Ostrobothnia, western Finland. Several of the rivers in the region suffer from acidification due to drainage and other alteration of sulphide rich soils. The study illustrates how limited areas with special geochemical characteristics can dominate the health of large systems.

AB  - A Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) concept, UbiGo, was implemented in Gothenburg, Sweden, and used for a 6-month period by 195 individuals in 83 households. Four participant subgroups were identified: Car shedders, Car accessors, Simplifiers, and Economizers. A qualitative analysis revealed that the subgroups had different reasons to join the service and different expectations of the change that would occur on the basis of the altered preconditions offered by the service. Previous car users reduced their use of private car and increased their use of public transport and active modes. Participants who did not have access to a privately-owned car but thought they needed one discovered that they managed well without. Other participants were reinforced in their existing behaviors but in ways they did not envisage, depending on which goals they had at the outset of the trial. Overall, the participants were also satisfied with the service, as well as with stated changes and non-changes, even if this in some cases meant more planning. Based on the empirical findings it could be argued that a service approach, such as UbiGo, has the potential to reduce the need for private car ownership, and enable people to change their mode choices and travel patterns. The potential relies however on a number of specific features of the service of which flexibility and a need- rather than a mode-based approach are key features.

AB  - Asexual reproduction by fissiparity has only been described from very few of the approximately 1300 nemertean species that otherwise mainly reproduce sexually. The best studied fissiparous species, Lineus sanguineus (Rathke 1799), is a cosmopolitan heteronemertean species inhabiting intertidal habitats of temperate coasts. Although sexual reproduction has never been described, molecular data suggest that sexual reproduction substantially shapes the genetic structure of the investigated populations. In an attempt to clarify the extent of sexual reproduction, three gene fragments (COI, 16S, ITS) were sequenced for 108 specimens sampled in 8 European localities. The results of a phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network showed no clear distinction between different populations, thus indicating the presence of sexual reproduction. Furthermore, we provide circumstantial evidence for the presence of a comparably long-lived planktonic larval stage as present in the closest relatives of L. sanguineus. To further understand the impact of abiotic factors on sexual reproduction and fissiparity, the effect of different temperature and illumination regimes on reproductive behavior and fragmentation was studied in specimens from a population from Bergen, Norway that share the same haplotype. Experimental setups represented summer (long light period and elevated temperature) and winter (short light and decreased temperature) conditions. Under winter conditions, a higher number of animals remained sexually mature and at least one specimen shed eggs on one occasion. Thus, although short light and/or low temperatures are most likely the influential factors on sexual maturity, the factors that influence fissiparity are less clear. The results of this study further solidify the cosmopolitan status of L. sanguineus and clarify the population structuring of this species. In addition, the study provides first data on the dynamics of sexual and asexual reproduction modes on which future investigations will have to expand, especially regarding genetic and physiological aspects.

AB  - Influenced by the spread of the global 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, primary emissions of particles and precursors associated with anthropogenic activities decreased significantly in China during the Chinese New Year of 2020 and the lockdown period (24 January-16 February 2020). The 2-month measurements of the number size distribution of neutral particles and charged ions showed that during the lockdown (LCD) period, the number concentration of particles smaller than 100 nm decreased by approximately 40% compared to the pre-LCD period in January. However, the accumulation mode particles increased by approximately 20% as several polluted episodes contributed to secondary aerosol formation. In this study, new particle formation (NPF) events were found to be enhanced in the nucleation and growth processes during the LCD period, as indicated by the higher formation rate of 2 nm particles (J(2)) and the subsequent growth rate (GR). The relevant precursors, e.g., SO2 and NO2, showed a clear reduction, and O-3 increased by 80% during LCD period, as compared with preLCD. The volatile organic vapors showed different trends due to their sources. The proxy sulfuric acid during the LCD period increased by approximately 26 %, as compared with pre-LCD. The major oxidants (O-3, OH, and NO3) of VOCs were also found to be elevated during LCD. That indicated higher J2 and GR (especially below 5 nm) during the LCD period were favored by the increased concentration level of condensing vapors and decreased condensation sink. Several heavy haze episodes have been reported by other studies during the LCD period; however, the increase in nanoparticle number concentration should also be considered. Some typical NPF events produced a high number concentration of nanoparticles that intensified in the following days to create severe aerosol pollution under unfavorable meteorological conditions. Our study confirms a significant enhancement of the nucleation and growth process of nanoparticles during the COVID-19 LCD in Beijing and highlights the necessity of controlling nanoparticles in current and future air quality management.

AB  - Key messageThe intra-annual variability in stem size of marginal beech population from south-eastern distribution range of beech in Poland is higher within than between populations.AbstractOne of the key issues of the distribution of tree species is their ability to track environmental changes. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is a species highly sensitive to extreme climatic events, because of its high phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we aim to determine the variability in stem size between and within marginal beech populations. Marginal populations of beech growing under uniform environmental conditions of provenance trial offer unique opportunity to detect adaptive differentiations driven by natural selection. In this work, we studied stem size variation recorded by automatic band dendrometers in four beech marginal populations growing in a common garden in the south-eastern distribution range of beech in Poland over the period 2016-2018. Strong climatic effects and weak provenance differences in seasonal stem size variation were observed. The provenances exhibited similar climate-related seasonal stem circumference variation. A high within-provenance variation was confirmed. Temperature of spring as well as temperature and precipitation of autumn were detected as key climatic parameters mostly for onset and end of stem size variation. Maximum stem size was mostly affected by the later end of its variation, which positively affected its duration. Climatic distance between beech provenances and provenance trial had a negligible effect on the variability in seasonal stem size variation between provenances. The evidence of weak inter-provenance and high intra-provenance variation in stem size changes observed in the south-eastern distribution range indicates that an individual-based approach could be a suitable strategy, when selecting for phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability, allocation or use between and within states. The concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution. Instruments of international water law, among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis - which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact - can serve as tools for water diplomacy. The obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience, and some of this has been synthesized into the Principles for Effective Joint Bodies which were adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the UNECE Water Convention in 2015. The Principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation.
   This paper analyses Finland's cooperation arrangements in the light of the Principles and assesses the extent to which Finland's transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the Principles. Taking a wider perspective, the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy. Relevant features include, inter alia, the competency and representation of the joint institution, its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted, and the cooperative mechanisms in place. Naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent, but the established joint bodies often play a significant role, specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources, but even beyond, in the prevention and settling of conflicts, and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level.

AB  - A large consumption of natural gas accompanied by reduced production capabilities makes Europe heavily dependent on imports from Russia. More than half of Russian gas is exported by transiting Ukraine, so in the context of the underlying conflict between the two, this is considered uncertain. Therefore, in this article, we modeled the natural gas transportation system using cooperative game theory in order to determine the bargaining power of the major players (Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and Norway) by using a form of the Shapley value. We described the interaction between countries as network games where utilities from transport routes are considered and proposed three scenarios where the gas flow from Russia to Ukraine is either diminished or completely interrupted, with the purpose of finding out how the bargaining power on this market is shifted in case of network redesign. In this context, we included in the analysis the scenario where the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will be finished. Results showed that Russia dominates the market in any scenario, and by avoiding Ukraine, its position is even further strengthened. Moreover, Germany's position remains stable considering its diverse imports and large storage capabilities, and its bargaining power increases in the case of diminishing or avoiding the Ukrainian gas pipelines.

AB  - Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. sensu lato (s.l.) is a dangerous forest pathogen causing root and butt rot disease in most conifers of the northern hemisphere. This pathogen is most widespread in the forests of Europe and North America. The economic impact on forestry related to tree mortality, reduction in timber yield, and wood rot is calculated in millions of dollars and euros. The genus Heterobasidion (Basidiomycota; Russulales) has been relatively recently separated into three genetically distinct groups (H. annosum, H. insulare and H. araucariae) comprising a total of 12 species and one newly described hybrid taxon. These species are the best studied in terms of the ecology, the physiology of control methods, and the tree's resistance to the pathogen. The article gives an overview of the symptoms and the etiology of the disease and provides information on ways to recognize the disease and limit the economic damage.

AB  - Purpose Technological change drives transformation in most sectors of the economy. Industry 4.0 technologies have been applied at different stages of a building's lifecycle. However, limited studies exist on their application in real estate facilities management (REFM). This study aims to assess the existing knowledge on the topic to suggest further research directions.Design/methodology/approach Scopus-indexed literature from 2013 to 2023 was examined and visualised using VOSviewer software to output quantitative (descriptive) results. Content analysis was used to complement the quantitative findings.Findings Findings indicated a concentration of research in China, Norway and Italy. The knowledge areas included three clusters: lifecycle integration and management, data curation and management and organisational and management capabilities. The benefits, challenges and support strategies were highlighted.Research limitations/implications More collaboration is needed across countries and territories on technology integration in REFM. Future research using alternative methodologies is recommended, with a focus on adopting and non-adopting REFM organisations. Further, implications for facility managers, employees, technology suppliers or vendors, training, organisations and management exist.Practical implications Further, implications for facility managers, employees, technology suppliers or vendors, training, organisations and management exist.Originality/value The study reveals the knowledge base on technology use in REFM. It adds to the evidence base on innovation and technology adoption in REFM.

AB  - This study, based on two questionnaire surveys from two cities in Norway with different climate conditions, explores to which extent weather tolerance in terms of travel behaviour here defined as using a non-motorized vehicle despite poor weather conditions (precipitation and/or cold weather) - is related to socio-demographic factors, environmental attitudes, transport habits as well as the climate conditions (coastal/inland) of where people live. Three indicators are used to measure 'weather tolerance': a) Disagreement to the statement "I always drive when it rains"; b) Willingness to walk 2-3 kilometers in minus 10 degrees Celsius or more in steady snowfall (yes/no), and c) Willingness to walk 2-3 kilometer in +20 degrees Celsius or more in steady rainfall" (yes/no). The study finds that environmental attitudes and travel habits (as perceived by the respondents) are the factors most strongly related to weather tolerance, independent on how it is measured, when other factors are controlled for. The findings suggest that policy measures to change attitudes/ increase environmental awareness as well as promoting outdoor activity in general can be effective in terms of making people choose active transportation even in poor weather conditions. This might be important steps to reduce the likelihood of car use in the future, when extreme weathers are to become more likely.

AB  - We studied the spatial distribution pattern of Bolitophagus reticulatus L. (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) in a boreal forest in south-ear;tern Norway. The beetle is monophagous and lives in basidiocarps of Fomes fomentarius (L.) Kickx. We collected 900 basidiocarps from all of the 452 birch trees infected with tinder fungus in the 225 ha study area. We then used logistic regression analyses to relate trees with and without beetle occurrence to patch size, isolation and other habitat characteristics. To understand why the beetle had disappeared from certain trees, we also did similar analyses on trees without present occurrence but with signs of earlier beetle presence versus trees with present occurrence of the beetle. The probability of B. reticulatus presence increased with tree diameter and with the number of dead basidiocarps on the tree. We interpret these variables as indicating the habitat patch size. The probability of beetle presence decreased as the distance to surrounding inhabited trees increased, even on a scale of less than one hundred meters. The fungus-infected trees were utilized to a much. higher degree when they occurred in clusters. We discuss to what degree a metapopulation model is relevant in our case. Several other, less common forest insects depend on wood-rotting fungi or dead wood for their survival. If a similar response to increased isolation of habitat patches can be assumed for some of the rare species, guidelines for an ecologically sustainable forestry should include not only the need for more dead wood in the modern forest, but should also consider the spatial distribution of these key resources.

AB  - Alexei Miller, as the head of the editorial board of the series, outlines the background of the production of the series and describes the vicissitudes encountered in writing these books from the initial plan to its realization. In particular, he recounts that the initial design of the series included volumes on the Volgo-Kama region and the Grand Duchy of Finland, while the history of the Ostsee region and South Caucasus were excluded due to the lack of sufficient number of scholars studying this region. Responding to criticism by reviewers, Miller reiterates that the volume Western Borderlands of the Russian Empire was not exclusively focused on the historical conflict of the Russian Empire with the Poles, but aspired to zoom in on the territory where the formation of Byelorussian, Jewish, and Ukrainian national identities was taking place. Miller defends the imbalance of the volume by its specific task to reconstruct the history of Russian imperial policy toward the western borderlands.

AB  - The Pasvik River experiences chemical, physical, and biological stressors due to the direct discharges of domestic sewage from settlements located within the catchment and runoff from smelter and mine wastes. Sediments, as a natural repository of organic matter and associated contaminants, are of global concern for the possible release of pollutants in the water column, with detrimental effects on aquatic organisms. The present study was aimed at characterizing the riverine benthic microbial community and evaluating its ecological role in relation to the contamination level. Sediments were sampled along the river during two contrasting environmental periods (i.e., beginning and ongoing phases of ice melting). Microbial enzymatic activities, cell abundance, and morphological traits were evaluated, along with the phylogenetic community composition. Amplified 16S rRNA genes from bacteria were sequenced using a next-generation approach. Sediments were also analyzed for a variety of chemical features, namely particulate material characteristics and concentration of polychlorobiphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides. Riverine and brackish sites did not affect the microbial community in terms of main phylogenetic diversity (at phylum level), morphometry, enzymatic activities, and abundance. Instead, bacterial diversity in the river sediments appeared to be influenced by the micro-niche conditions, with differences in the relative abundance of selected taxa. In particular, our results highlighted the occurrence of bacterial taxa directly involved in the C, Fe, and N cycles, as well as in the degradation of organic pollutants and toxic compounds.

AB  - Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are vital in the sustainable future of transport systems. Increased BEV adoption makes the realistic assessment of charging infrastructure demand critical. The current literature on charging infrastructure often uses outdated charging behavior assumptions such as universal access to home chargers and the "Liquid-fuel"mental model. We simulate charging infrastructure needs using a large-scale agent-based simulation of Sweden with detailed individual characteristics, including dwelling types and activity patterns. The two state-ofart archetypes of charging behaviors, "Plan-ahead"and "Event-triggered", mirror the current infrastructure built-up, suggesting 2.3-4.5 times more public chargers per BEV than the "Liquidfuel"mental model. We also estimate roughly 30-150 BEVs served by a slow charger may be needed for non-home residential overnight charging.

AB  - Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions are functional and highly significant systems in industrial settings. Their large interfacial area makes them prone to deterioration, including the oxidation of polyunsaturated lipids. Spruce galactoglucomannans (GGM), which are wood biomacromolecules that are abundantly available from emerging forestry biorefineries, were characterized as novel, bio-based, sustainable stabilizers against lipid oxidation in rapeseed O/W emulsions. The formation of hydroperoxides, volatile oxidation products, and polymerized lipids were followed in emulsions during an accelerated storage test at 40 degrees C for two weeks. The free and bound phenolic residues associated with plant polysaccharides were quantified to explain the differences in the oxidation pathways of emulsions stabilized with GGM and their carboxymethyl derivatives (CMGGM) in comparison to the "golden standard" food stabilizer, gum arabic (GA), and a promising alternative, corn fiber gum (CFG). GGM and CMGGM efficiently inhibited and altered the pathways of lipid oxidation of rapeseed oil. GGM showed an exceptional capacity to inhibit lipid oxidation and act as a multifunctional stabilizer, enhancing both the physical and oxidative sility of emulsions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that indicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across biogeographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, reproductive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological functions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the European scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional measure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p < 10(-6)) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different running water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discriminate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.

AB  - Questions: What vegetational changes does a boreal rich fen (alkaline fen) undergo during a time period of 24 years after drainage? How is plant species richness affected, and what are the changes in composition of ecological groups of species? Is it possible to recover parts of the original flora by rewetting the rich fen? Which are the initial vegetation changes in the flora after rewetting? What are the major challenges for restoration of rich fen flora after rewetting?
   Location: Eastern central Sweden, southern boreal vegetational zone. Previously rich fen site, drained for forestry purposes during 1978-1979. The site was hydrologically restored (rewetted) in 2002.
   Method: Annual vegetation survey in permanent plots during a period of 28 years.
   Results: There were three successional stages in the vegetational changes. In the first stage there was a rapid (< 5 years) loss of rich fen bryophytes. The second step was an increase of sedges and early successional bryophytes, which was followed by an increase of a few emerging dominants, such as Molinia caerulea, Betula pubescens and Sphagnum spp. After rewetting, there are indications of vegetation recovery, albeit at slow rates. Depending on, for instance, initial species composition different routes of vegetation change were observed in the flora after drainage, although after 24 years, species composition became more homogenous and dominated by a few species with high cover.
   Conclusion: Major changes have occurred after changes in the hydrology (drainage and rewetting) with a severe impact on the biodiversity among vascular plants and bryophytes. Several rich fen bryophytes respond quickly to the changes in water level (in contrast to vascular plants). The recovery after rewetting towards the original rich fen vegetation is slow, as delayed by substrate degradation, dispersal limitation and presence of dominant species.

AB  - Brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Scandinavia spend 5-7 winter months in dens. The denning period is a vulnerable time for bears because they are unable to escape from disturbances without losing valuable amounts of energy. Bears normally avoid human infrastructure when denning, but due to an expanding bear population some bears den relatively close to humans. We tested the hypothesis that bears denning closer to infrastructure selected more concealed den sites, as they do when selecting resting sites in the non-denning season. We analyzed horizontal cover and terrain ruggedness relative to distance from human infrastructure for 49 dens from 32 individuals differing in sex, age, and reproductive status. Bears used dens that were more concealed or located in more rugged terrain when closer to roads and settlements that had potential for high human activity. Our results suggest that human activity affects not only where bears den, but also the smaller-scale characteristics of den sites: cover and terrain. Increased knowledge about anthropogenic effects on bear denning behavior can add to a broader understanding of brown bear habitat use.

AB  - Given the complexity of current social structures and environmental problems, attaining a truly sustainable society seems rather improbable today. Not only has society not been planned for the complexity of the preconditions and effects that sustainability entails, sustainability is also unlikely given current individual consumption patterns, prevailing economic worldviews, and the short-term focus of political processes. In this context, transdisciplinary research is seen more and more as key to attaining social change towards sustainability. In order to do this, non-academic actors must be extensively involved in knowledge production, and normative considerations have to be explicitly incorporated. This paper targets three key areas for discussion. These are participation, value rationality and mutual learning. The interactions of participation and value rationalities through mutual learning processes are developed through two examples of ongoing transdisciplinary research and collaboration in Western Sweden.

AB  - Specimens of the isopod Saduria entomon were caught during late winter nights in Finland and divided into three groups:  one was not at all exposed to any light and served as the control; a second was exposed to midday sunlight of 9.1 x 10(20) qu/m2s for 30 min; the third was exposed to artificial white light of 4.2 x 10(20) qu/m2s during the day for 30 min.  The visual sensitivity thresholds as well as V/log I curves of 15 exposed animals from 30 min to 456 h postexposure were recorded at random intervals and compared with values obtained from nine control animals.  Only a very minor reduction of sensitivity in exposed animals was noticed.  Parallel ultrastructural studies confirmed that light-induced structural derangements of visual membranes, known to occur in other species, were minimal, with an enlargement of microvilli to twice their normal diameter being the most obvious.  Spectral sensitivity curves recorded from nine control animals reverased one single peak to light of 550 nm wavelength, close to maximum transmission of the water in which the animals occur.  The results show that apparently not all crustaceans possess eyes that are easily damaged by bright light and-in view of the light-induced sensitivity loss reported in Mysis relicta (13)-highlight the danger of attempting to predict how photoreceptors of another species would respond, even if the species occurred in the same habitat.

AB  - Although threatened by forestry, our knowledge concerning saproxylic insects is strongly biased towards well-known orders, mainly beetles (Coleoptera). The beetles have, therefore, formed the basis on which conservation measures of other groups have been formulated. Despite being more species-rich, the Diptera have been rather neglected. Moreover, our limited knowledge of the Diptera suggests that their demands on the dead wood substrate differ markedly from that of coleopterans. We tested if this is true by comparing the substrate requirements of dipteran and coleopteran species by analysing the affinities of species assemblages for logging residues differing in age, size, and tree species. Insects were reared out from the same samples of bioenergy wood from clear-cuts in Sweden. 15 species of Brachyceran flies were compared with 56 species of Coleoptera. We found the average level of specialisation to be similar between the two groups, but the dipterans had (contrary to the expectations) a higher proportion of specialists. Affinities for differently aged wood were similar. More dipterans than beetles were associated with the coarsest wood (diameter 9 cm-15 cm). More dipterans than beetles tended to be associated with aspen (Populus tremula), while Coleoptera tended to be more associated than Diptera with oak (Quercus) and spruce (Picea abies). We conclude that most recommendations for conserving the saproxylic beetle fauna also seem to benefit dipterans, but that the dipterans might be even more sensitive to which qualities of the wood that is preserved. The high conservation value of aspen is already recognised and our results for dipterans strengthen this. The high incidence of many dipteran species in logging residues suggests that many dipterans use sun-exposed environments.

AB  - During the last decade, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data has been used increasingly in numerous studies to assess e.g. bird habitats and biodiversity, but less often in studies focusing on ground dwelling mammals.
   Here, we utilized ALS data to study the role of forest structure in moose habitat use. The data consisted of 18 GPS-collared moose in western Finland. ALS data was extracted around the moose locations. The aim was to examine the habitat selection patterns of moose within a year. Special attention was given: 1) to winter to detect when moose-related forest damages occur (when moose favor young forests) and 2) to the calving period to examine the possible role of forest structure in determining where females give birth and where they move with the newborn calves.
   During calving, females were occupying forests with minimal amounts of vegetation below the height of five meters. Shortly after calving, the females and their calves moved to forests with dense vegetation under the height of five meters, which is explained by the increasing demand of food both for the growing calf and the lactating mother. In summer and autumn, all moose were found more often in mature forests with higher and denser canopies, which is explained by the fact that their most preferred food during autumn (e.g. berries and twigs) grows in mature forests. This trend diminished as autumn turned to winter and moose started to favor vegetation below five meters. In general, we were able to see clear patterns and differences in habitat use between sexes, as well as with calves, and we gained new and more accurate information about the role of the forest structure to calving females. The results show that ALS data alone can yield valuable additional information about wildlife ecology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new mobility ethos is needed for cities looking to overcome the problems that have been accumulated for decades by a transport paradigm that prioritises automobiles over people. Bike-sharing, a measure promoting voluntary travel behaviour change, could be part of a refined toolbox that will help in forging this new ethos. Despite a rapid emergence during the last handful of years, as evidenced by 1956 operational local schemes and approximately 15,254,400 self-service public use bicycles across the world, bike-sharing has been attracting negative attention lately. Tens of schemes have closed down, deemed as financial or operational failures, stigmatising bike-sharing's brand and putting the future of the concept itself in jeopardy. However, discounting bike-sharing as flawed may not be fair or accurate. This paper identifies a formula of success for bike-sharing operations based on a state-of-the-art case study analysis, which is supported by primary data evidence from two survey-based studies in Sweden and Greece. This paper suggests that residents in cities hosting or looking to host bike-sharing schemes are usually very supportive of them but not always likely to use them. More importantly, this paper delivers some key policy and business lessons that form a survival guide for effectively introducing and running public bicycle schemes. These lessons include, among others, the need for: tailoring the system design and expansion strategy according to the host city needs, city-operator and commercial partner synergies, more bike-friendly infrastructure and legislation, pro-active cultural engagement, anti-abuse measures, enhanced fleet management and realistic profit expectations.

TI  - EXCERPTS from the Correspondence of Leeni Ploompuu (1886-1972) and Eduard Hubel (1879-1957)
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA  - Estonian
AB  - Leeni Ploompuu was one of a small number of Estonian women to receive secondary education in Finland at the turn of the last century, in preparation for attending university. In Finland, women had the legal right to matriculate in university on par with men, while in Estonia and elsewhere in the Russian Empire, women were admitted to parallel courses and were not awarded degrees. Access to higher education on the part of women did not change in Russia until Tsar Nikolai II's directive in August of 1915.
   Studying in Finland was expensive, and Leeni's opportunities were largely due to the connections and financial support of her brother, Jakob Ploompuu, a bookseller and director of a home economics school in Tallinn. During summer holidays in Tallinn in 1906, Leeni met the writer and journalist Eduard Hubel (whose pen name was Mait Metsanurk), and the two young people began taking long walks along the seashore while avidly discussing intellectual topics, and their own ideals and aspirations. That fall, when Leeni returned to her university studies in Helsinki, a lively correspondence began which continued until the late spring of 1908 when Hubel married.
   This article accompanies a selection of letters from Leeni and Eduard's correspondence, which in its entirety consists of 92 letters, 54 from Eduard to Leeni, and 38 from Leeni to Eduard. The archive is incomplete, in that Leeni's letters from 1906 are missing. One of Eduard's first letters to Leeni from that period is included to illustrate the tonality of the beginning of their correspondence. Eduard and Leeni wrote to each other about cultural events, books, the theatre, but most often about the need for furthering general education among Estonians, not only institutionally, but through an enriched, intellectually vital public world. Both journalism and literary works were of great significance to these goals, keeping in mind that after a brief period during the 1905 Revolution, the press in the Russian Empire was censored. Both Leeni and Eduard were active in organisations: Leeni in the temperance movement, and in groups of Estonians who met regularly for conversation and Finnish lessons; Eduard in the Estonian Education Society and the committee seeking to found the new Literary Society in Tallinn. In Helsinki, Leeni's paths crossed with other Estonian expatriates who had either participated in or supported the 1905 Russian Revolution, and who had to flee from the brutal repressions that followed in 1906. Unlike Hella Murrik (Wuolijoki), another of the female Estonian students at the University of Helsinki, Leeni was not socialist-minded, preferring a more conservative nationalism in keeping with temperance ideals. Eduard was also sceptical about socialism, though his comments on the topic in his letters are laconic.
   One of the frequent themes of Eduard's letters is his regret that he was unable to attend university for financial reasons. Struggles to fill the gap through reading and studying on his own could not match the intensity and focus of university studies, particularly on a low journalist's salary. In addition, Eduard had written plays, one of which was staged at the new Estonia Theatre in 1906, and was writing his first prose works. Eduard's feelings of inferiority and jealousy at Leeni's advantages cast a shadow over their correspondence. These two young people clearly had romantic feelings for each other, and talked about future plans for a life together, but Leeni was inclined to postpone them until she had a chance to make a public contribution in the field of education: her dream was to found coeducational schools in Estonia along similar lines as the secondary school she had attended in Kuopio. Eduard ran out of patience, and in April of 1908, he abruptly informed Leeni of his upcoming marriage. The two correspondents remained friends throughout their lives. Leeni married Emil Vesterinen, a forestry specialist, and remained in Finland for the rest of her life, where she taught the Estonian language and was active in promoting the Estonian cause. Eduard Hubel (Mait Metsanurk) became a prominent writer of realistic prose and also wrote several plays.
   Two facets of the correspondence make this archival material particularly useful in research on the early 20th century. One of these is the problematics of the "new woman", as can be seen in Leeni's long letter from October of 1907 about emancipated women and their life choices, and in Eduard's response. The other is that the language of this correspondence is Estonian at a time when most letters between educated Estonians were still written in German. Leeni and Eduard's letters provide a fascinating glimpse of an era of transition in the language practices of educated Estonians.

   Results: Four main themes were identified. 1) Dealing with medical uncertainty: the GPs aimed to make clear medical decisions and avoid unnecessary prescriptions and hospitalizations, yet this was challenged by uncertainty regarding the severity of the exacerbations and concerns about overlooking comorbidities. 2) Knowing the patient: contextual knowledge about the individual patient provided a supplementary framework to biomedical knowledge, allowing for more differentiated decision-making. 3) Balancing the patients' perspective: the GPs considered patients' experiential knowledge about their own body and illness as valuable in assisting their decision-making, yet felt that dealing with disagreements between their own and their patients' perceptions concerning the need for treatment or hospitalization could be difficult. 4) Outpatient support and collaboration: both formal and informal caregivers and organizational aspects of the health systems influenced the decision-making, particularly in terms of mitigating potentially severe consequences of "wrong decisions" and concerning the negotiation of responsibilities.
   Conclusion: Fear of overlooking severe comorbidity and of further deteriorating symptoms emerged as a main driver of GPs' management decisions. GPs consider a holistic understanding of illness and the patients' own judgment crucial to making reasonable decisions under medical uncertainty. Moreover, GPs' decisions depend on the availability and reliability of other formal and informal carers, and the health care systems' organizational and cultural code of conduct. Strengthening the collaboration between GPs, other outpatient care facilities and the patients' social network can ensure ongoing monitoring and prompt intervention if necessary and may help to improve primary care for COPD patients with exacerbations.

AB  - Hereditas began with articles on plants since its first issue in May 1920 (six out of eight) and continued with more original articles (43% of the total of this journal) on plants (of which 72% of those in plants were on crops) until today. In December 1922, the 140-page article The Genotypical Response of the Plant Species to the Habitat by evolutionary botanist Gote Turesson (Institute of Genetics, Lund University, angstrom karp, Sweden) became available. This publication shows that plant phenology has a genetic basis and may ensue from local adaptation. As a result of this research involving various plant species, Turesson elaborated further in this article his term ecotype "as an ecological sub-unit to cover the product arising as a result of the genotypical response of an ecospecies to a particular habitat." Although plant articles included in Hereditas involved from its beginning, trait inheritance, mutants, linkage analysis, cytology or cytogenetics, and more recently gene mapping and analysis of quantitative trait loci with the aid of DNA markers, among others, since the mid-1980s several publications refer to the population biology of plant landraces, which are locally grown cultivars that evolved over time by adapting to their natural and cultural environment (i.e., agriculture), and that may become isolated from other populations of the same crop. This article provides a briefing about research on plant science in the journal with emphasis on crops, summarizes the legacy to genetics of Gote Turesson, and highlights some landrace diversity research results and their potential for plant breeding.

AB  - The planetary boundaries concept has triggered a vast amount of pure and applied scientific research, as well as policy and governance activities globally. Indeed, it has rapidly become a centerpiece of sustainability study. It is crucial to review the scientific state of the planetary boundaries (PB) concept systematically. However, there is a lack of research on drawing a scientific investigation map of planetary boundaries. Therefore, to clarify the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, research hotspots, and frontiers of planetary boundaries, a scientometric analysis was performed based on 530 academic publications on planetary boundaries from 2009 to 2021. This paper conducted the analysis by visualizing the social network, dual-map overlay, co-cited references, structure variation article, and co-occurrence keywords with CiteSpace. The results show that as a new achievement and paradigm in sustainable development research, the planetary boundaries framework is gradually getting global attention and promotion, which has increasingly become an interdisciplinary hot research topic. The most productive authors and institutions are concentrated in England, the USA, Germany, and Sweden. Relevant articles were mainly published in journals focusing on ecology, earth, marine, veterinary, animal, economics, and politics. In addition, we summarized four predominant research themes by clustering keywords: the calculation of single boundary threshold and present value, the integration with assessment methods such as life cycle assessment and footprint families, the downscaling of planetary boundaries, and the expansion to economic and social domains. For scholars who are interested in this topic, this paper would be a useful reference and guideline.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to provide humanity with a global roadmap to sustainability. Official SDG indicators have been intensively developed, and they have a prominent and pronounced role as a key monitoring and policy instrument. Furthermore, various complementary or alternative indicator sets have been introduced at the global, regional and national levels. This article focuses on the risks related to the national indicators. The analysis is based on experiences from the preparation processes of sustainable development indicators in Finland and insights from indicator professionals and stakeholders in Finland and Germany. The risks related to overuse, nonuse and misuse of indicators are analyzed from the perspectives of indicator contents, processes of production and communication and external context factors. Opportunities for avoiding different risks and improving the desired societal impacts and influences of indicator usage are discussed. The concept of risk is helpful in terms of empirical diagnosis and for formulating mitigation recommendations.

AB  - Long-term (1965-2000) changes of macrozoobenthos and hydrography have been studied in the Gulf of Finland (GoF). For the first time, statistical multivariate time series analysis is applied to Baltic Sea data to verify the relationship between biota and interacting environmental factors causing large-scale hypoxia in the open sea. For macrozoobenthos, a consistent long-term development of the assemblages was found over the study area. In the period before the 1990s, very sparse macrozoobenthos prevailed, followed by a notable expansion of macrofauna between the late 1980s and early 1990s and leading to a maximum of total abundance and species number between 1991 and 1996. After that, a sudden collapse of the communities took place in 1996-1997. The hydrographical changes included a continuous decrease in salinity and density stratification until the early 1990s, after which an increase took place again. In contrast, low mean and minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations were observed at the beginning of the study period, followed by increasing values in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and a simultaneous decline of oxygen conditions in 1996. Based on non-linear trends estimated by dynamic factor analysis (DFA), high and significant correlations were found between total macrofauna abundance, number of species, salinity, oxygen conditions, strength of stratification and freshwater run-off. The results confirm that oxygen is obviously a fundamental factor that determines the state of the macrozoobenthos in the deep GoF, overruling other abiotic factors. However, the improvement of the oxygen conditions is apparently caused by the long-term decrease of salinity and loss of stratification in the relatively shallow GoF, reflecting large-scale changes in hydrography of the Baltic Sea during the long 1977-1993 stagnation period. Thus the development in GoF is opposite to the deeper basins in the central Baltic. We conclude that salinity and stratification are probably linked with climatic variability via freshwater run-off, which may be important in regulating the oxygen conditions and state of macrozoobenthos in GoF.

AB  - The transition toward a circular and biobased economy requires the biorefineries and bio-based industries to become more resource efficient with regards to their waste and by-product management. Organic by-products and waste streams can be an important source of value if used in feasible pathways that not only have a low environmental impact but also preserve or recover their energy, nutrients, and other potentially valuable components. Through development of a multi-criteria assessment framework and its application on a real case, this article provides methodological and practical insights on decision making for enhanced by-product management. Our framework includes 8 key areas and 18 well-defined indicators for assessing the environmental performance, feasibility, and long-term risk of each alternative. We studied six different management options for the stillage by-product of a Swedish wheat-based biorefinery and our results shows that the most suitable options for this biorefinery are to use the stillage either as animal fodder or as feedstock for local biogas production for vehicle fuel. This multi-criteria approach can be used by bio-based industrial actors to systematically investigate options for by-product management and valorisation for a circular and bio-based economy.

AB  - In this article the interaction and cooperation of local level actors is conceived as being premised on two organizational logics, that is, on the territoriality-based general purpose elected local government form and on institutionalized functionality-based single-purpose non-elected intermunicipal cooperation. Drawing on the work by Hooghe and Marks the two variants are identified as "type I" and "type II" institutional arrangements. Germany and France are treated as comparative cases in point. In Germany the institutional development resulted, with federalism-typical variance between the Lander, in a mono structure of type I local government in some and in a dual structure with type II intermunicipal bodies in others, whereas in France the dual structure with a multitude of type II intermuncipal bodies (intercommunalite) has prevailed. Recently a new wave of territorial reforms in East German Lander has extended the coverage of type I local government and reduced that of type II intermunicipal bodies, while in France the introduction of the type II communautes bears traces of the type I local government form. In both countries these reform moves have been triggered largely by mounting criticism of the operational ( conflict and transaction) costs and democratic deficits of the dual structure with type II intermuncipal bodies. These advances of the type I local government form concur with local level territorial reforms put into effect in a growing number of other European countries. Finally the article interprets the findings by drawing on and applying the conceptual government/governance scheme.

AB  - Relative growth rates (RGR) and carbon-based secondary compounds (CBSCs) were quantified in four dominant terricolous arctic-alpine mat-forming lichens with different preferences for snow cover. The aim was to evaluate the effects of snow depth, and thus snow cover duration, on lichen growth and performance. The species, Alectoria ochroleuca, Flavocetraria nivalis, Cladonia mitis and Cetrariella delisei, are associated with increasing snow depth, respectively. They were transplanted for one year at five snow depths (0, 60, 120, 160 and 200cm measured in early May) along each of four natural ridge to snow bed gradient transects in oceanic-alpine sites (western Norway). Snow slightly thicker than in source habitats caused negative RGR in the ridge top-dependent A. ochroleuca and the co-occurring F. nivalis with somewhat higher snow tolerance. Only C. mitis with the broadest ecological niche had positive RGR along most of the gradients (0-160 cm), even outside its natural range. The most snow-tolerant species, C. delisei, tolerant also to temporal inundation in water, had the lowest RGR. Nevertheless, it performed as well in places with little or no snow as in places where it grows naturally. Snow depth significantly affected total concentrations of CBSCs mainly in A. ochroleuca, which experienced substantial mass loss under snow. There was a highly significant increase in usnic acid concentration with increasing mass loss in A. ochroleuca, probably because usnic acid decays more slowly than other components. In conclusion, snow reduced lichen RGR, but in species-specific ways. Therefore, increasing snow depth per se along spatial and/or temporal scales likely reduces abundance and distribution of dominant mat-forming lichens in the alpine ecosystems of Scandinavia.

AB  - Railway track infrastructure asset management is a challenging problem with added values on safety, society and environment. With railways serving as a key sustainable mode of transportation for passengers and freight, the industry is facing an increasing demand to expand its capacity, availability and speed, resulting in faster deterioration of the ageing railway track infrastructure. Given the constrained maintenance budgets and the environmental challenges posed by climate change, railway asset managers have to identify economically and environmentally justifiable track maintenance strategies without compromising on safety. To this end, this paper proposes a risk-informed approach to arrive at sustainable railway track maintenance strategies while considering the associated track maintenance costs and impacts on train operation (environmental emissions and risk of derailments). Monte Carlo simulation is employed to address data uncertainties associated with track quality data, the costs and benefits of track maintenance and train operation. The proposed approach is successfully applied to the heavy-haul railway lines in Sweden and Australia to compare some alternative maintenance strategies and identify the sustainable one.

Through an in-depth case study, this paper follows the undertakings within a recent demonstration project aimed at implementing a residential bike-sharing service. The involved actors succeeded in presenting a functional service but failed to make the service commercially viable. Consequently, the configuration did not spread beyond the niche level. Based on this finding, the paper identifies a risk in enforcing progressive solutions to becoming commercialised, and urges public actors to play a greater role in steering the transition towards a more sustainable future transport system. By shedding light on the process of failing, the paper contributes important lessons concerning the setup of future bikesharing systems that can challenge the automobility regime.

TI  - The Road to the North: Sami and Finn Encounters in the Inari and Teno River Areas as Depicted in Poetry and Oral Tradition
T2  - ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This article presents a critical examination of Sami/Finn encounters in Lapland as depicted in poetry and oral tradition during the past decade. Utilizing a background created by feminist discourse this analysis extends the discussion of cultural encounters from a theoretical discussion into the more versatile world experienced by the local people, both Sami and Finn. I approach the topic from the conceptual construct of anthropology, employing Tim Ingold's approach toward the "ecology of life" and Michael Jackson's methodology of radical empiricism. The encounters described here can be examined on two different levels-on one hand I discuss stories of the encounters between Sami people and Finns, on the other hand the encounters between Sami researchers and Finnish researchers as they interact on levels of analytical research.

AB  - Virtually all studies exploring the use of taxonomic surrogates in assessing patterns of diversity have focused on clear shifts in the location of samples in multivariate space. The potential use of coarser levels of taxonomic resolution to detect patterns of variability in multivariate space, corresponding to beta-diversity in the case of presence/absence data, remains unexplored. Here we considered five ecological data sets of highly diverse marine molluscan assemblages to test the hypothesis that patterns in compositional heterogeneity would be maintained at coarser levels of taxonomic resolution.
   Italy, Norway, New Zealand and the Arctic.
   We used multivariate dispersion based on the Jaccard resemblance measure of presence/absence data as a measure of beta-diversity to test the null hypothesis that patterns of heterogeneity in species composition for molluscs would be maintained at coarser levels of taxonomic resolution. Tests to compare beta-diversities among groups (based on distances to centroids and using 9999 permutations) were carried out separately for each of five data sets at the species level and then for each of genus, family, order and class levels.
   Differences in multivariate dispersion at the species level (heterogeneity in the identities of species) were maintained for genera and for families, but not at coarser levels of taxonomic resolution (order or class). These results were consistent across all data sets, despite differences in their spatial scale and extent, geographical location, environmental and habitat features (benthic soft sediments, rocky reefs or kelp holdfasts).
   These results suggest that either genera or families may be used as effective taxonomic surrogates to detect spatial differences in beta-diversity for molluscs. The use of surrogates can provide considerable sampling efficiencies for biodiversity assessments. We consider, however, that a degree of caution and more work is needed, as heterogeneity at the species level may not be reflected by taxonomic surrogates at smaller spatial scales.

AB  - This study investigates the early effects of forest regeneration with selective, and small scale clear-cutting, on ground beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) community composition in a homogenous, mature spruce forest in Southern Bavaria (Hoglwald), Germany. Carabid beetles were sampled with pitfall-, emergence-, and window-traps, from 1999 to 2001 during a pre-treatment year, the year of cutting, and the year after cutting. In the spruce stand we found a relatively low species richness with few dominating species. Selective cutting preserved this carabid assemblage. At the clear-cuts carabid species richness increased in the year of cutting, because of the invasion of small open field species, and the persistence of most forest species. Also, number of individuals increased due to higher numbers caught in the window-traps. The first open habitat species appeared just a few months after felling. However, in the next year the numbers of individuals, especially of forest species,were drastically reduced. Also, the number of species decreased, and was just slightly higher than on the control plot (mature stand). According to the DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) forest interior species had the same habitat preferences as net building spiders (Amaurobiidae, Linyphiidae) and other families of beetles (Staphylinidae, Curculionidae). Several groups of open habitat species responded positively on different patches found in the clear-cut: (1) diversity ofground vegetation, respectively coverage of shrubs, (2) favour for moist patterns, and water filled ruts (together with Gastropoda), or (3) low coverage of ground vegetation (together with free hunting spiders, Lycosidae). Different structures side by side (mature forest, selective cutting, open areas) may improve diversity on a forest scale. Small openings can serve as an important retreat for open habitat species. However, if clear-cuts become the dominant element, forest species maybe threatened. With selective cutting species richness of carabids is not improved; however, the remaining forest carabid species may be preserved during the early phase of the regeneration process.

AB  - Service-based alternatives to private vehicles and public transport are increasing. These innovations are hoped to boost the transition to sustainable mobility, addressing challenges such as congestion, air quality and the large share of CO2 resulting from traffic. To achieve this transition, there is an urgent need for collaboration between private companies and public authorities, especially locally. We claim that insufficient attention is paid to the agencies of the practical actors, such as car sharing operators, which is the key to understanding what this collaboration requires. Orchestrating the collaboration successfully is also a prerequisite for the sustainability of the services. We use interview data from car sharing operators and public authorities in Finnish cities to analyze the local-level implementation of shared mobility services. Our results show how the local public authorities play a crucial role in allowing the services to flourish but also ensure the services' environmental and social sustainability.

AB  - The model EFIMOD 2 was developed for the description of tree (stand) growth and biological turnover of elements in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The model has the following features. (i) It is a spatially explicit stand-level simulator for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and Pendula birch (Betula pendula L.) on different forest soils growing under different climatic conditions in Europe; each stand consists of individual trees for which growth is modelled depending on the tree's position within the stand and local light, water and available nutrient conditions. (ii) The model has a tree-based submodel for total biomass distributed between several biomass compartments. (iii) The calculations include natural regeneration as well as ground vegetation dynamics. (iv) The soil submodel (ROMUL) is used to assess organic matter dynamics and nitrogen availability for tree growth as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture content and litter quality. (v) EFIMOD 2 calculates nitrogen cycling and accounts for atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation and leaching, vegetation uptake, litter fall and nitrogen redistribution within and between trees and soil horizons. (vi) Monte-Carlo simulations are done to simulate the extent of naturally oscillating variability.
   EFIMOD 2 allows for short-term and long-term simulations of natural and managed forest ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of forest sites, climatic conditions and silvicultural regimes. The model calculates dendrometric parameters for every tree, including undergrowth and seedlings, total growing stock, and pools of coarse woody debris and soil organic matter, with special reference to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The model is effective for assessing wood productivity and evaluation of forest management regimes to meet criteria and indicators of Sustainable Forest Management. This includes a general evaluation of biodiversity and soil sustainability. The model system allows for the direct use of standard forest inventory data. Output variables include carbon and nitrogen pools in the stand and soil, CO2 emissions, and tree (stand) growth and yield. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Producing an adequate quantity of healthy food without polluting the environment is a serious challenge for future agriculture around the world. The Food 21 research program in Sweden has researched all aspects-economic, environmental, and social-of sustainable farming systems. This paper presents some of the research from that and other relevant international research programs that have focused on better nutrient-use efficiency, especially for nitrogen and phosphorus. It shows that a range of sustainable solutions to nutrient-use efficiency exists, some of which are complex but some very simple. Government policies, including subsidies; research and technology; and public acceptance of farming practices all combine to create these solutions. Participatory approaches to knowledge transfer are needed, in which scientists, policy makers, farmers, advisers, and consumers exchange information and together build sustainable farming systems.

AB  - Climate change is triggering adaptation by people and wildlife. The speed and magnitude of these responses may disrupt ecological equilibria and potentially cause further biodiversity losses, but this has rarely been studied. Species inhabiting human-dominated landscapes may be particularly negatively affected by human adaptations to climate change. This could be, for example, the case of ground-nesting farmland birds, a group of highly vulnerable species that may be impacted by shifts in the timing of mechanical farming operations in response to climate change. Here we aim to explore whether trends in phenology of breeding ground-nesting birds differ from those of farming practices, and whether differences lead to the emergence of phenological mistiming with detrimental consequences to the birds. To achieve our objective, we tan linear mixed effects models using a 38 year dataset on onset of farming practices (i.e. sowing dates) and laying date of two endangered ground-nesting farmland birds (Northern lapwing and Eurasian curlew) in Finland. We found that timing of farming practices advanced slower than birds nesting phenology, with birds progressively starting nesting before fields are sown. These nests are at high risk of destruction from incoming sowing operations. The results highlight the importance of considering human adaptation responses, in addition to those of wildlife, for implementing species conservation in managed landscapes under climate change.

AB  - Palaeoenvironmental and radiocarbon data are presented from an infilled freshwater basin (Lambwath Mere) in Holderness, East Yorkshire (UK). The site contains a rare and detailed c. 4000 cal. yr mid-Holocene pollen record for the floating-leaved aquatic plant Trapa natans (L.) (water chestnut). Competing hypotheses (natural and anthropogenic) to explain the earlier presence of this 'exotic' species in Holderness are evaluated. Maximum Trapa frequencies date to the interval 6200-4200 cal. BP and are shown to occur during shallow open water conditions just prior to overgrowth of the basin by semi-terrestrial vegetation communities. There is no clear palynological or archaeological evidence from the site to suggest settlement or significant human activity around the mere during this episode. It appears more likely that the occurrence of water chestnut at this site can be explained through natural factors (a combination of a favourable climate and the availability of a suitable habitat) rather than as a prehistoric human introduction.

AB  - Studies of the spatial scale to which saproxylic beetles respond to the surrounding landscape have generated varied results. We tested how the relationship between beetle fauna and variables describing the landscape changed over ten years of succession. We hypothesized that the relationship to the nearby landscape would be stronger when the wood was in a later successional stage. This is because habitat predictability is higher in the later stages, as they have a longer turnover time of beetle assemblages than early stages. With higher predict. ability of the habitat, theory expect lower dispersal capacity of hosted species, and thereby higher relation to landscape on smaller scale. The saproxylic beetles were sampled on the same wood objects (high stumps) in three time steps over ten years in 20 clear-cuts in south Sweden. In accordance with our expectations, the nearby (< 5 km radius) forest-landscape variables explained more of the species composition of the saproxylic beetles later in the succession. The first- and third-years geographical location (longitude and latitude) were more important and explained, for three different subsets of beetle species, 21%, 4% and 25% of the fauna composition. At this time, the forest-landscape variables explained almost nothing. After ten years the pattern was the opposite, with surrounding forest explaining up to 27% of the variation, and regional factors almost nothing. We showed that this was related to a shift in the species assemblage after ten years, with an increasing share of species associated with more decayed wood. Our results suggest that successional stage of the dead wood helps explain at what scale saproxylic species respond. Several of the surrounding forest variables were associated with biodiversity hotspots, which thus seem to exist also for species associated with abundant wood types. Latersuccessional species are more indicative of hotspots than earlier-successional species.

AB  - Despite the key role of actor networks in progressing new sustainable technologies, there is a shortage of conceptual knowledge on how policy can help strengthen collaborative practices in such networks. The objective of this paper is to analyze the roles of such policies so-called network management throughout the entire technological development processes. The analysis draws on the public management and sustainability transitions literatures, and discusses how various network characteristics could affect the development of sustainable technologies, including how different categories of network management strategies could be deployed to influence actor collaborations. The paper's main contribution is an analytical framework that addresses the changing roles of network management at the interface between various phases of the technological development process, illustrated with the empirical case of advanced biorefinery technology development in Sweden. Furthermore, the analysis also addresses some challenges that policy makers are likely to encounter when pursuing network management strategies, and identifies a number of negative consequences of ignoring such instruments in the innovation policy mix. The latter include inefficient actor role-taking, the emergence of small, ineffective and competing actor networks in similar technological fields, and a shortage of interpretative knowledge.

AB  - Finding ways to encourage investments in renewable electricity production is crucial to reach a transition to a sustainable energy system. While in the energy policy literature, investments are usually explained by economic or regulatory policies, recent studies have suggested that some investors are boundedly rational and may respond differently to policies. In this paper, a framework is proposed to make a more complete analysis of the institutional demands influencing emerging investors in renewable electricity production. Based on 35 cases, both formal and informal demands were identified and their impact on emerging investors' behavior was analyzed. Results show that besides formal institutional demands, emerging investors were influenced by their task environment and by various informal demands which originated in investors' collective and internal contexts. However, different investors were affected by different institutional demands. They also responded in different ways to the same demands; while some perceived a specific demand as imposing, others regarded it as inducing. These findings provide a better understanding of the institutional forces affecting emerging investors in renewable electricity. The paper suggests new policies to handle the heterogeneity of investors and opens up for a new panorama of informal policy channels, where network effects can be utilized to trigger emerging investors' decisions.

AB  - Railway infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather events such as elevated temperature, flooding, storms, intense winds, sea level rise, poor visibility, etc. These events have extreme consequences for the dependability of railway infrastructure and the acceptable level of services by infrastructure managers and other stakeholders. It is quite complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the various facets of railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the work identifies the challenges and barriers for climate adaptation of railway infrastructure and suggests recommended actions to improve the resilience towards climate change. It also provides recommendations, including adaptation options to ensure an effective and efficient railway transport service.

AB  - In a sustainable forestry recirculation of nutrients through the application of ashes from forest residues can be an essential way to guarantee healthy and vital forests. Wood ashes can also be regarded as a measure against soil acidification. Wood ashes were applied at various rates to the soil in a 35 years old pine (Pinus sylvestris, L) stand at Ringamala in Blekinge, South Sweden. The experiments started in 1984. The different treatments gave a clear effect on soil chemistry with decreased acidity and aluminum ion concentrations. The base saturation increased in both mor and upper mineral soil layers. Generally no significant increases were found in soil concentrations of heavy metals, except for Cu which increased significantly in the mor layer. Also the extractable Mn concentration increased, in spite of the increased pH in the soil after application of ashes. In order to achieve a biological circulation of nutrients through ash application without polluting the environment, it is of ultimate importance that the wood chips used in power plants and other furnaces have a low concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants.

AB  - The optimal foraging theory, the nutrient balance hypothesis, and the plant association theories predict that foraging decisions and resulting tree damage by large mammalian browsers may be influenced by the species richness and species composition of forest stands. This may lead to either associational susceptibility (increased damage on a focal plant in a mixed stand) or associational resistance (reduced damage in a mixed stand). Better understanding of the mechanisms and the relative importance of tree species richness and composition effects on foraging by mammalian browsers is needed to support sustainable management of forests and mammal populations. However, existing knowledge of forest diversity effects on foraging by large mammalian browsers comes largely from observational studies while experimental evidence is limited. We analysed winter browsing by moose (Alces alces L.) in a long-term, large-scale experiment in Finland, which represents a tree species richness gradient from monocultures to 2-, 3- and 5-species mixtures composed of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.). The intensity of browsing per plot increased with tree species richness while browsing selectivity decreased with tree species being targeted more equally in species-rich mixtures. Tree species composition of a plot was also an important determinant of intensity of browsing. The greatest browsing occurred in plots containing preferred species (pine and birch) while intermediate preference species (larch and alder) experienced associational susceptibility when growing with pine and birch compared with their monocultures or mixtures without pine and birch. In contrast, we found no evidence of associational resistance; the presence of a least preferred species (spruce) in a mixture had no significant effect on moose browsing on other tree species. We demonstrate that the presence of alternative forage species allows moose to spend longer opportunistically foraging in a plot, resulting in increased level of damage in species-rich stands and stands containing preferred tree species. Our results highlight the limitations of the optimal foraging theory in predicting browsing patterns and demonstrate the importance of associational effects within mixed stands.

AB  - The socio-economic crisis of the past few years has led to a progressive and marked decline in the production of coal power plants in Europe. This situation affects the regions where coal is the main traditional energy source. Energy from forests is considered to be a good alternative to coal. The exploitation of forest biomass in these regions could counteract the negative effects posed by the marked decline in traditional coal mining activities. Given the abundance of forest in Asturias, Spains main coal mining area, the present work was conducted on the Central Coal Basin (CCB). This study focuses on the territory of the mining areas within the CCB, known as municipalities. The main goal was to evaluate the existing biomass resources in order to assess its sustainable energy potential and its replicability in other coal mining regions in Europe. The multiscale methodology used considers a combination of mass, energy and costs of the biomass available, to estimate the bioenergy obtainable and the assessment of the techno-economic feasibility of solid biofuel production as a source of alternative energy. A detailed evaluation of forest residues was carried out including the economic and environmental constraints. The average collection efficiency was 43.0% resulting in an estimated biomass total cost of 84.10 6/dry t. Finally, the conclusion was made to locate the Biomass Logistic Centre (BLC) in Oviedo due to its favourable technical, economical and geographical characteristics. The proposed BLC would have a production capacity of 17 dry kt/year of pellets, 8 dry kt/year of wood chips and 3 dry kt/year of briquettes, of which 40% (31 dry kt/year) would be collected within a 50 km radius. Such production would avoid 51 kt/year of CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since IMO's recent approval of the E-navigation strategy, projects like EfficienSea2 have focused on improving information exchange, safety and efficiency of navigation. To identify current gaps and potential development opportunities, this study investigated the current maritime network, typical work practices and technologies through qualitative research with the Swedish Vessel Traffic Services, coastal pilots and navigation instructors. Maritime operations happen within a resilient sociotechnical system where ship- and shore-based operators work in cooperation to achieve common goals. However, the low interconnection of information technologies was evident, and basic local navigational information was dispersed, sometimes conflicting or inaccessible, increasing uncertainty and complicating decision-making for ship- and shore-based stakeholders. New e-navigation solutions may not only alter work processes but also the organisation of the maritime network.

AB  - Heat is the largest energy end-use in the world, accounting for about 50% of global final energy consumption. In 2019, the International Energy Agency pointed out that the development of renewable energy heating has become a key way for the global response to climate change, environmental pollution control, energy transformation and sustainable development. Biomass energy as a priority for the development of renewable heat sources has been valued by countries around the world. Developed earlier in the EU countries, their biomass heating technology is more mature, and their policy system is more comprehensive. Accounting for 86% of the total renewable thermal energy consumption, biothermal energy in these countries has achieved significant effect and become an important driving force for the decarbonization of the heating industry. This practice has a very high demonstration effect globally. This paper constructs a comprehensive zoning theoretical framework of biomass energy heating and utilization in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the supply and demand potential of biomass energy heating system, the FCM method is used to quantify the status of biomass resource utilization in 28 EU countries. The results show that there are significant differences in the utilization of biomass energy heating in the EU countries, which can be divided into five categories of comprehensive zones, which are the key development category (Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia), resource priority category (Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovenia), policy-oriented category (Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Cyprus), good-potential category (Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Spain, Poland, France, and Slovakia)and under-developed category (UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta). At the same time, this paper discusses the characteristics and causes of biomass heating utilization of different types of EU countries, and summarizes the mature heating systems and rich experience in the EU countries with China's current heating situation and its future challenges concerning renewable energy development. Finally, this study provides some implications for China's clean heating development, energy efficient use, energy supply security and energy structure upgrade.

AB  - Activity ''Forest Energy Production'' focused on the development and evaluation, in the context of conventional forestry systems, silvicultural and forest management practices which optimise productivity for traditional products and wood for energy, while safeguarding the forest ecosystem. A series of meetings, workshops, and review papers involving the three participating countries of Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom were planned and completed. An additional workshop in Switzerland was also held.
   Increasing production of biomass for energy is generally found to be positive, from silvicultural, economic, and environmental perspectives. Eight specific forest management systems were investigated and/or reported: five conventional systems involving multiple products in softwood and mixed wood, and three hardwood systems emphasising production of biomass for energy. Modifications in silvicultural practice to also produce biomass for energy included increased opportunities for thinnings, intermediate cuttings, and stand and site rehabilitation as well as more flexible and efficient harvesting systems, Economic benefits accrued from increased investment in harvesting and burning technology, improvements in stand quality and site utilisation, and substitution for more expensive fuels, especially if all costs are considered. Environmental effects were found to be generally positive, but negative effects of nutrient acid organic matter removal on the overall sustainability of specific systems are possible. These need to be addressed. Harvest and management guidelines are being designed and put into practice.
   Social, institutional, and technical barriers to the increased use of biomass for energy are being addressed by specific strategies and initiatives involving programs and incentives for production, market development, research and education. Net positive effects indicate increased use of forest biomass for energy, in the short and long term. The development of comprehensive sustainable strategies to capitalise on this trend have the potential to realise numerous benefits.

AB  - Wood is generally considered as a sustainable construction material. However, there are not sufficient wood resources in many countries or regions, especially those short of land resources. These countries and regions have to import wood from overseas. Therefore, it is imperative to determine how to choose sustainable importing sources in order to improve the sustainability performance of using wood in construction. This study compares the sustainability performance of wood imported from different regions by considering wood harvesting, manufacture, and transportation. A framework accounting energy consumption and CO2 emissions is developed for sustainability assessment. The results show that importing wood from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to Taiwan demands a relatively lower amount of energy than from other regions. Specifically, importing wood from Canada (West) demands the lowest amount of energy (2095 MJ/m(3)), while importing wood form Brazil consumes the highest amount of energy (5356 MJ/m(3)). In addition, findings showed that the CO2 emissions generated from importing wood from Sweden are significant lower than those from other regions, although the energy consumed during the importing process is relatively high. The study also revealed that the wood manufacturing process and marine transportation contribute to the most energy consumption and CO2 emissions among all importing processes analysed from most of studied regions.

AB  - A successful discrimination of fish populations is essential for sustainable management and assessment. Otolith shape analysis has been used on several species to reveal their population structure. Our aim was to use the otolith shape of European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) to investigate large- and small-scale geographical variability across the Greater North Sea ecoregion. The otolith shape was extracted from digitalised images and transformed into Wavelet coefficients to be analysed with multivariate statistics. Otolith shape was observed to follow the genetic population structure recently defined for the region, supporting the latest revision of the stock boundaries. Four main groups were identified based on phenotypic variability: (i) Norwegian fjords; (ii) North Sea and offshore Skagerrak-Kattegat; (iii) coastal Skagerrak-Kattegat; and (iv) Uddevalla fjord. However, 4-fold crossvalidations based on Linear Discriminant Analysis resulted in low accuracy limiting at the moment the ability to use otolith shape analysis for population identification at an operational basis. Our results show the importance of coastal areas, which might be inhabited by distinct populations of sprat that are currently not acknowledged in the management and assessment.

AB  - Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e. g., food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the. first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis has led to an unprecedented acceleration in the number of people working from home (WFH). This article applies a practice theoretical lens to expand the pre-pandemic telework literature which often overlooks how WFH is part of complex socio-material arrangements. Based on 56 household interviews in the UK, the United States, and Norway during lockdown in Spring 2020, we reveal the everyday realities of WFH, exploring their implications for the future of work. Developing the concept of boundary traffic, which refers to the additional interaction and collision of a range of everyday practices normally separated in time and space when working outside the home, we provide some insights into how disruption and de- and re-routinization vary by household type, space, and employer's actions. Much teleworking scholarship highlights technological and spatial flexibility of work, without recognizing the mundane realities of WFH when there is no space for a large computer monitor, preferences to be with children even when a secluded home office is available, or a feeling that important social connections diminish when working on a virtual basis. We discuss the future of work in relation to digitalization, social inequality, and environmental sustainability and conclude by stressing how WFH cannot be understood as merely a technical solution to work-life flexibility. Rather, lockdown-induced WFH has deeply changed the meaning and content of homes as households have resolved the spatial, material, social, and temporal aspects of boundary traffic when embedding work into the domestic practice-bundle.

AB  - Grazing by large herbivores is well-known to influence plant communities, while much fewer studies have been carried out on grazing effects on invertebrates. In Norway, some 2.2 million sheep graze on outlying pastures during summer, most of them in the alpine zone, but no study has reported the relative impact of sheep grazing on invertebrate communities relative to other environmental factors such as the plant community and altitude. A fully replicated landscape-scale experiment (2.7 km(2)) was performed with no, low (25 per km(2)) and high (80 per km(2)) sheep densities in an alpine habitat of Norway (1050-1300 in a.s.l.). The increased vulnerability hypothesis (HI) predicts that the more folivorous invertebrates, the higher the grazing pressure by sheep, as large herbivore grazing may stress the plants so they are more vulnerable to insect herbivory. The increased defence hypothesis (H-2) predicts increased levels of general anti-herbivore defences, and thus a lower abundance of invertebrates with increasing sheep densities. Contrary to both predictions, no evidence was found that sheep grazing affected invertebrate richness, or abundance of folivorous, predatory or detritivore invertebrates - in a community dominated by Diptera and Hemiptera. Demonstrating an effect will always be a function of sample size, but at least our study shows that other environmental variables (such as plant species richness and functional plant richness) are more important determinants than sheep grazing for the selected invertebrate groups. Our study was short-term (first year of grazing) mainly designed to test specific hypotheses related to induced plant defences; long-term effects are probably owing to the impact sheep may have on vegetation composition, primary production, litter cover and soil properties.

AB  - Aim: Current global warming is driving changes in biological assemblages by increasing the number of thermophilic species while reducing the number of cold-adapted species, leading to thermophilization of these assemblages. However, there is increasing evidence that thermophilization might not keep pace with global warming, resulting in thermal lags. Here, we quantify the magnitude of thermal lags of plant assemblages in Norway during the last century and assess how their spatio-temporal variation is related to variables associated with temperature-change velocity, topographic heterogeneity, and habitat type.Location: Norway.Time period: 1905-2007.Major taxa studied Vascular plants:Methods: We inferred floristic temperature from 16,351 plant assemblages and calculated the floristic temperature anomaly (difference between floristic temperature and baseline temperature) and thermal lag index (difference between reconstructed floristic temperature and observed climatic temperature) from 1905 until 2007. Using generalized least squares models, we analysed how the variation in observed lags since 1980 is related to temperature-change velocity (measured as magnitude, rate of temperature change, and distance to past analogous thermal conditions), topographic heterogeneity, and habitat type (forest versus non-forest), after accounting for the baseline temperature.Results: The floristic temperature anomaly increases overall during the study period. However, thermophilization falls behind temperature change, causing a constantly increasing lag for the same period. The thermal lag index increases most strongly in the period after 1980, when it is best explained by variables related to temperature-change velocity. We also find a higher lag in non-forested areas, while no relationship is detected between the degree of thermal lag and fine-scale topographic heterogeneity.Main conclusions: The thermal lag of plant assemblages has increased as global warming outpaces thermophilization responses. The current lag is associated with different dimensions of temperature-change velocity at a broad landscape scale, suggesting specifically that limited migration is an important contributor to the observed lags.

AB  - The construction of the new Norwegian E39 highway comprises the excavation of extended tunnelling systems, which lead to a tremendous amount of blasted rocks. Among others, a sustainable cost-benefit application of these resources is represented by their local use as construction material in the unbound layers of the roads. Two types of nontraditional additives are investigated to improve the mechanical properties of aggregates; this is particularly useful for those rocks that do not fulfil the design requirements in their natural status. This work focuses on the field application of two innovative stabilizing technologies based on organosilane and lignosulfonate. The performance of these additive agents is characterized by considering three typical road base layer sections built on purpose according to real practice and added with water (no treatment), organosilane, and lignosulfonate. The test sections are subjected to climatic actions only as neither traffic nor surface courses are applied. With the investigation covering two years, the layers' stiffness, deformation, and resistance to penetration are evaluated by employing a light-weight deflectometer and dynamic cone penetrometer. Both organosilane and lignosulfonate significantly enhance the mechanical properties of the treated base layers.

AB  - The main objectives of the manuscript are the monitoring and measurement of economic and social development, as well as assessment of renewable energy development in EU countries from the perspective of sustainable development. EU STRATEGY 2020 has basic objectives related to energy development, which implies significant changes in overall development. Energy exploitation represents significant factor of economic, environmental and social development in separate countries, as in EU as a whole. The article will present sample methodology for energy strategy assessment, through analysis of basic economic, social and environmental indicators in EU27 countries. This research includes inter alia analysis of energy production in the EU27 countries, energy import dependency, quantity of pollution as result of energy production and consumption, and human development index (HDI). The countries with the greatest values of Total GDP (eg. Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy) are positioned in the first ten countries in the total emission of CO2, SOx, and NOx. The leading countries in the values of GDP per capita (eg. Luxemburg, Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands) have the middle values of pollution as result of energy production and consumption, except Luxemburg which is at the leading place. The relation between energy export and energy import in EU27 region reflects energy dependency in EU27 region and represents essential energy related problem. The country with the best export-import ratio is Denmark.

AB  - Water and sewage (WS) systems are, like most grid based infrastructural systems, often centralised and hierarchical and the end user has almost no possibility to influence the technical standards, business models or system architecture. The preferred method for connecting new areas to the grid are underground water pipes and gravity flow for sewage. Thus, the WS system is "tightly coupled". It is hard to change and conservative in its system culture, exhibiting a strong "momentum" or "path dependence".In this article we investigate an unusual case in the development of WS-systems. As a rule, WS-systems, as most infrastructural systems, develop gradually through incremental innovations, and system owners/utilities traditionally build their systems "from the inside out". In our case, we investigate a situation where the end users took the initiative to connect a residential area, Aspvik, part of the municipality of Va & BULL;rmdo & BULL;, outside Stockholm, Sweden, to the municipal grid and thus expand the WS-system, not from the inside out, but from the outside in.Furthermore, we highlight another unusual feature: the role of a resident that acted as the "entrepreneur" in this process of WS-system expansion. The entrepreneur had unique trust building abilities in the local community, which the regime actor (the WS utility), could not match. Historically, inventor-entrepreneurs have been common, acting as "system builders" in the establishment phase of new infrastructural systems. However, entrepreneurs outside the regime are not common in the WS sector.Although atypical in mature WS systems in developed countries, these types of local initiatives or hybrid solutions are common in developing countries. In this article, we argue that there are lessons to be learnt from our case, when dealing with system expansion processes both inside and outside the Global North.

AB  - Decarbonizing residential transportation sector depends on the energy mix. A need for environmental efficiency of electric vehicles considering the life cycle impacts of electricity generation under different mix scenarios is essential. This research aims to present the first empirical analysis on the environmental efficiency of battery electric vehicles across 27 European countries, considering the average electricity mix, marginal electricity mix (2015-2020), and renewable energy-based electricity mix (2030-2040) scenarios. The midpoints environmental impacts per kWh electricity generation were estimated for each country using the latest ecoinvent v3.7 life cycle environmental impact data. Well-to-wheel environmental impacts of battery electric vehicles were calculated for each country based on a functional unit per km traveled. An input-oriented non-restricted and weight restricted frontier models using the panel-based weights obtained from the European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) survey was built to model the environmental efficiency. Finally, the footprint efficiency results related to different electricity production mix scenarios and future projections to improve the environmental efficiency of battery electric vehicles were suggested. The results reveal Finland and Netherland as the most environmentally efficient countries using BEVs for all the electricity mix scenarios. It is seen that average mixes cause lower environmental efficiency scores of battery electric vehicles than marginal mixes due to higher shares of renewable electricity sources in marginal mixes.

AB  - Pollen monitoring at the north-western fringe of the European boreal forest by means of modified Tauber traps, was carried out during the years 1996-2004 along a coast-inland gradient, including two altitudinal transects inland. The relationship between annual pollen deposition and local flora and vegetation was investigated. Pinus sylvestris stands in the open coastal lowland and mixed birch-pine forest inland are reflected by a mean pollen accumulation rate (PAR) of 200-400 grains cm(-2) yr(-1), and dense pine-dominated forest inland by >= 2000 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). The deposition of Betula pubescens-type pollen in the coastal birch woodland is 80-350 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). During the same tithe interval, the sub-alpine birch forest inland has a PAR of 240-720 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). This figure increases to c. 2000 when the two high-productive years 1998 and 1999 are included in the mean. The alpine forest-line ecotone is reflected in the pollen deposition by a decrease in Betula pubescens-type, meadow and heath herbs, and an increase in Salix: and alpine herbs with altitude. This floristic change starts in the upper part of the sub-alpine belt and continues gradually into the open alpine belts. The presence of phytophagous insects in the pollen traps is found to influence the pollen record by overrepresentation of insect-dispersed herb taxa, but does not obscure the recognition of local vegetation types. PAR and percentages show the same main trends along the geographical gradients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - (1) Background: The World Health Organization recommends active commuting as a source of physical activity. Active commuting is determined by various factors, including the socioeconomic status (SES) of families and neighborhoods, distance to schools, perceived neighborhood safety, lifestyles and availability of walkways and biking paths. This study aimed to assess factors associated with modes of transportation to and from school among adolescents aged 16-19 living in a middle-sized city in Sweden. (2) Method: Three hundred and fourteen students, of whom 55% were females, from schools in the city of Vasteras participated in the study. Printed as well as web-based self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. (3) Results: Adolescents living in high SES neighborhoods were 80% more likely to bike or walk to school (OR = 1.80; CI: 1.01, 3.20) than adolescents living in low SES neighborhoods. Furthermore, active commuting was associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (OR = 1.77; CI: 1.05, 2.97) and less consumption of junk foods (OR = 0.43; CI: 0.26, 0.71), as compared to passive commuting. (4) Conclusions: Active commuting is a cost-effective and sustainable source of regular physical activity and should be encouraged at a societal level.

AB  - The hinterland leg of maritime containerized transport as a part of supply chain has been increasingly pressured by larger volumes, as well as by a need to fulfill sustainability requirements that are expressed by social opinion and formal regulations. There is a potential to relieve this pressure through integration of a dry port, as a seaport's inland interface, in the supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to explain how a supply chain can benefit or enhance its outcomes of cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation, by the integration of a dry port. The data for this case study is collected through interviews and site visits from the privately owned Skaraborg dry port, Sweden; and the study is limited to the actors of the transport system involved in the development and operations of the dry port integrated setup. The results show that the six supply chain outcomes (cost, responsiveness, security, environmental performance, resilience, and innovation) are perceived by the actors as being desirable, and can be enhanced by the integration of a dry port in the supply chains. In particular, the enhancement of the supply chain outcomes can be achieved due to intermodality and reliability of rail transportation and customization of services associated with the dry port integrated setup, and by increasing the capacity of transportation system.

AB  - The anticipated increasing utilisation of forest biomass necessitates improved understanding of its long-term consequences on forest productivity. We have used a model of carbon and nitrogen fluxes to predict effects of different management regimes in Norway spruce stands at three levels of fertility. Stands with high production are the least sensitive to intensified harvesting, partly because these stands occur in regions with high nitrogen deposition which compensates for the removal in nitrogen in harvests. Intensified thinning with stem-only removal is the management that affects productivity least followed by whole-tree harvesting at clear-fellings. Whole-tree thinnings are less beneficial and shortened rotation times the least desirable from a production point of view. Increases in total biomass harvests are at the expense of stem harvest, which can mean a conflict between volume and value. The importance of secondary vegetation as is also discussed.

AB  - While it is well-known that skid trails in forests locally increase soil compaction and illumination, the effect on vegetation and its spatial and temporal variation have hardly been studied in temperate forests. We surveyed Norway Spruce (Picea abies), Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forests to reflect the range of the prevalent forests types and ecological gradients of Northern Bavaria, Germany. In each forest type, we chose skid trails with different times since last use (0-2 years ago, 3-6 years ago, >= 7 years ago) to address the temporal aspect and sampled 4-m(2) plots on the trail itself, adjacent to the trail and in the forest interior to address the spatial aspect. We analysed the response of soil compaction, canopy cover, vascular plant and bryophyte species richness, vegetation cover and height, both in total and differentiated by layer, and mean ecological indicator values to the use of skid trails. Skid trails exhibited significantly higher soil compaction together with a more diverse, more light and moisture demanding vegetation compared to the forest interior. On the trails, graminoids were favoured over woody perennials. Vegetation adjacent to the skid trail resembled the forest interior, yet soil compaction exceeded that of the forest interior. Irrespective of time since last use, the soils on skid trails remained more compacted and likewise ecological response of understory vegetation did not change with time. Canopy cover and species richness responded strongly site-specific, and effects lasted the longest in the surveyed Scots Pine dominated forests but were diminished in European Beech dominated forests. Our results indicate a shift to a more ruderal and wetland-like vegetation on skid trails, which, however, hardly extended into the adjacent forest stand. Overall, plot-scale richness was higher on skid trails than in adjacent the adjacent forest, suggesting that skid trails could contribute to greater habitat diversity in managed forests. Since soils remained compacted even for several decades without use, a designated skid trail system is essential. There is a lack of long-term studies on the understory response to the use of skid trails and further research focussed on the persistence in time is needed.

AB  - Mountain topography gives rise to often dramatic climate-driven elevation gradients in primary productivity, which can generate substantial biodiversity variation. Therefore, mountain areas may be particularly useful for evaluating the ecological consequences of climate change. Arthropods are the most diverse animal phylum, which play important roles in most ecosystems. However, despite their ecological importance, we have limited information on how arthropods vary along elevation gradients. We investigated how taxonomic richness, taxonomic composition, and spatial structuring of spider and insect communities varied along elevation gradients and among three geographic locations in a mountain region of northern Sweden. The locations provided a latitude gradient spanning approximately 3 degrees (from 62 degrees N to 65 degrees N), but were otherwise selected to contain similar environmental characteristics. Taxonomic richness of both spiders and insects declined monotonically with increasing elevation, and there were limited differences between the geographic locations in such declines. Taxonomic composition varied with elevation for both taxonomic groups, but also differed among the three sites. Linyphiid spiders were more widely distributed along the elevation gradients than other spider taxa, whereas a broad taxonomic range of insects occurred over almost all elevations. We observed nested as well as modular spatial distributions of both spider and insect communities along the elevation gradients. While the modular patterns suggest that species turnover has generated distinct communities at different elevations, some generalist species were still widespread throughout large parts of the gradients. Our results point to smaller differences among geographic locations than among taxonomic groups in how taxonomic richness and community structuring varied with elevation. We interpret these results as support for taxonomically specific adaptations to environmental conditions being important for structuring arthropod communities. We also suggest that climate-driven changes to arthropod communities in mountain environments may be regulated by two not mutually exclusive processes, one in which generalist species may become more dominant and shift their ranges upward and one in which high-elevation specialists may go extinct because of increasingly fragmented habitats.

AB  - In the last decades, sustainable development has been one of the key guiding principles in the European Union policies. It is based on a three-pillar framework - economic development, social development and environmental protection - that are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. As energy appears to be the cornerstone of economic growth, Europe 2020 strategy emphasizes the importance to make European Union more sustainable by means of the establishment of a long-term approach with a clear guidance to climate change. However, empirical literature about methods to elaborate SD indexes is scarce. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to obtain a Synthetic Index of Energy Sustainable Development for EU-15. Based on 33 variables, three indexes are calculated related to energy security of supply, competitive energy market and environmental protection dimensions which are later aggregated into a Synthetic Index. Our results show that Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Portugal and UK have the better scores. The success of these member states is given by the development of a suitable management in their energy policies regarding the reduction of their energy dependency, the increase of competitiveness in their energy markets and the establishment of measures to increase climate change protection. New reinforcing policies are necessary in intermediate member states based on new energy saving actions (in the cases of Sweden, Austria and Finland), the introduction of more competition in its energy market (in the case of Italy) and environment protection actions (in the case of Germany). Greater efforts are necessary in member states that have the worst results (Spain, Ireland, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg). EU's budget support should be available for these member states in order to develop new and more effective actions that allow them to secure access to importations of energy sources under the best possible conditions while supplying energy at competitive prices and protecting the environment. It requires better coordination of national energy policies and greater cooperation between member states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The willingness to pay (WTP) for different types of elements and other environmental qualities of the agricultural landscape were investigated by a choice experiment study. To get value measures of a set of attributes as policy relevant as possible, the WTP for 28 levels of 12 attributes was estimated. Two survey versions concerned permanent grassland and two concerned field elements of cultivated land. A sample of 8000 randomly selected Swedish inhabitants was used. The estimated values vary significantly between linear field elements and grassland types, where stone walls and oak-wooded pastures, respectively have the highest marginal WTP. Highly valued environmental qualities are biodiversity, visibility and absence of brushwood. Reference points were included to capture preference heterogeneity. The study cannot reject that respondents may value environmental service levels based on their reference points.

AB  - The main goal of setting energy efficiency priorities is to find ways to reduce energy consumption without harming consumers and the environment. The renovation of buildings can be considered one of the main aspects of energy efficiency in the European Union (EU). In the EU, only 5% of the renovation projects have been able to yield energy-saving at the deep renovation level. No other study has thus far ranked the EU member states according to achieved results in terms of increased usage in renewable sources, a decrease in energy usage and import, and reduction in harmful gas emissions due to energy usage. The main purpose of this article is to perform a comparative analysis of EU economies according to selected indicators related to the usage of renewable resources, energy efficiency, and emissions of harmful gasses as a result of energy usage. The methodological contribution of our study is related to developing a complex and robust research method for investment efficiency assessment allowing the study of three groups of indicators related to the usage of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and ecological aspects of energy. It was based on the PROMETHEE II method and allows testing it in other time periods, as well as modifying it for research purposes. The EU member states were categorized by such criteria as energy from renewables and biofuels, final energy consumption from renewables and biofuels, gross electricity generation from renewables and biofuels and import dependency, and usage of renewables and biofuels for heating and cooling. The results of energy per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions per million inhabitants (ECO2), energy per capita, the share of CO2 emissions from public electricity, and heat production from total CO2 emissions revealed that Latvia, Sweden, Portugal, Croatia, Austria, Lithuania, Romania, Denmark, and Finland are the nine most advanced countries in the area under consideration. In the group of the most advanced countries, energy consumption from renewables and biofuels is higher than the EU average.

AB  - Health care systems in Europe and worldwide are facing huge challenges due to population aging, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and technological innovation. Anticipating future skills for people working in the health care sector to meet new healthcare demands is a challenge for European Union (EU) member states. Hence member States need to act swiftly to avoid skills mismatches and gaps in the workforce within the healthcare sector to ensure the workforce is equipped with the right skills to adapt to a continuously changing health care environment driven by technological innovations, demographic transitions and legal evolution.
   In the academic literature very frequently soft skills are ranked among the most crucial skills for health care managers (1) but there are few studies on how to develop effective team-members and good teamwork skills in healthcare management education. Additionally due to increasing scarcity of resources devoted to welfare programmes, economic competencies and managerial skills are going to be progressively more demanded especially among healthcare providers' organisations (2). In order to cope with complex needs and tasks in healthcare also interprofessional cooperation and exposure to an international context is seen as vital (3,4). Internationalization can be seen as a powerful opportunity for higher education in general and for future health care management professionals in particular. For example across the EU, health and social systems and related policies are becoming more interconnected than ever before. The spreading of diseases does not stop at borders; and neither do patients, staff, or technology.
   The summer school EUROPAMO (European Patient Mobility on the example of health care service for tourists in the Veneto region) was organized jointly between four European university-level institutions (University of Bologna (Italy), University of Oslo (Norway), Erasmus University Rotterdam (The Netherlands) and Management Center Innsbruck (Austria) and the local health care authorities of the Italian Veneto region in June 2013 and 2014 and provides an example how to integrate international and interprofessional elements into healthcare management education. The majority of the costs of the summer school were financed by a successful application for an "Erasmus Intensive Program" by the European Commission. The Veneto region has a population of 4.8 million and has become famous as a major tourist destination, which increases dramatically twice a year during the peak summer and winter seasons. Consequently, Veneto makes for a very interesting case study of patient mobility and health tourism in Europe as the significant flow of tourists brings a series of health care challenges for regional health care services to contend with (5).
   The aims of this article are twofold. After giving a brief overview about the role of internationalization in higher education it firstly describes how international and interprofessional aspects have been integrated into the learning design of a 2-week summer school for postgraduate health care management students jointly organized by four European universities. Secondly it is illustrated how the cooperation between four European university-level institutions in an Erasmus Intensive Program can contribute to develop sustainable long-term cooperation expressed through the development of a joint master degree program in health economics and management.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis networks conventionally provide economic and environmental benefits to participating industries. However, most studies have failed to quantify waste management solutions and identify network connections in addition to methodological variation of assessments. This study provides a comprehensive model to conduct sustainable study of industrial symbiosis, which includes identification of network connections, life cycle assessment of materials, economic assessment, and environmental performance using standard guidelines from the literature. Additionally, a case study of industrial symbiosis network from Sodankyla region of Finland is implemented. Results projected an estimated life cycle cost of euro115.20 million. The symbiotic environment would save euro6.42 million in waste management cost to the business participants in addition to the projected environmental impact of 0.95 million tonne of CO2, 339.80 tonne of CH4, and 18.20 tonne of N2O. The potential of further cost saving with presented optimal assessment in the current architecture is forecast at euro0.63 million every year.

AB  - The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) is regarded as the soundest approach for quantifying taxon-specific plant cover from pollen data. The reliability of relative pollen productivity (RPP) estimates is fundamental in the accuracy of quantitative vegetation reconstruction using the LRA approach. Inconsistent RPP estimates produced by different studies can cast doubt on the reliability and applicability of quantitative vegetation reconstruction. Therefore, it is crucial that the RPP estimates are evaluated before being applied for quantitative vegetation reconstruction. We have tested two alternative approaches, namely, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) method and a splitting-by-subregion strategy, using surface pollen assemblages and the REVEALS model-the first step in the LRA-to evaluate the reliability of RPPs estimates of 10 target taxa obtained in the cultural landscape of Shandong. We compared the REVEALS estimates (RVs) with observations of regional vegetation abundance (OBVs) and pollen proportions (PPs). The RVs of all taxa are generally closer to OBVs than PPs, and the degree of similarity depends strongly on the abundance of individual taxa in plant and pollen; taxa dominant in the region show the highest similarity between RVs and OBVs, such as Artemisia, Poaceae, and Humulus. The RVs of all herb taxa except Humulus and Asteraceae SF Cichorioideae are slightly overrepresented, and the RVs of all tree taxa are underrepresented except for Castanea. The comparison of RVs with OBVs collected from different spatial extents shows that the RVs of all herb taxa are more similar to OBVs collected from shorter distances (100 km and 75 km for the entire region and the subregion, respectively), whereas the RVs of all tree taxa are more similar to OBVs collected from longer distances (150 km and 100 km for the entire region and the subregion, respectively). Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance to test different sizes of area for vegetation surveys for evaluation of the RVs given that the appropriate size of vegetation survey may vary between low pollen producers (mainly herbs) and high pollen producers (mainly trees). We consider that the LOO strategy is the best approach in this case study for evaluating the RPP estimates from surface moss polsters. The evaluation confirms the reliability of the obtained RPP estimates for their potential application in quantitative reconstruction of vegetation abundance in temperate China.

AB  - Nutrient export from drained peatland has significant impacts on aquatic environments in Nordic catchments. Spatial information on variations in nutrient concentrations across different landscapes and land uses is needed to design measures for achieving the good ecological status of the EU Water Framework Directive. In this study we determined background concentrations in natural peatland-dominated streams and examined effects of peatland use practices on water quality in headwater catchments. We quantified sources for different elements by joint analysis of water chemistry, isotopes, and hydrology for 62 small catchments in North Ostrobothnia, Finland. Concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids were relatively high in catchments containing drained peatland. In particular, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were elevated during baseflow conditions when flow likely originated from deeper soil layers. Total concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids, and loss on ignition also showed elevated values, and changes in the ratio of dissolved and particulate forms, especially the C/N ratio, were observed. Past drainage had a stronger effect on organic matter and nutrients concentrations than local hydroclimate conditions. These results strongly indicate that current water protection methods are not sufficient to capture all seasonal variations in nutrient and suspended solid loads from drained peatland. Thus, more effort and actions are needed for water protection in such areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human encroachment on wildlife habitats has contributed to the emergence of several zoonoses. Pathogenic hantaviruses are hosted by rodents and cause severe diseases in the Americas and Eurasia. We reviewed several factors that potentially drive prevalence (the proportion of infected rodents) in host populations. These include demography, behavior, host density, small mammal diversity, predation, and habitat and landscape characteristics. This review is the first to include a quantitative summary of the literature investigating hantavirus prevalence in rodents. Demographic structure and density were investigated the most and predation the least. Reported effects of demographic structure and small mammal diversity were consistent, whereby reproductive males were most likely to be infected and prevalence decreased with small mammal diversity. The influences of habitat and landscape properties are often complex and indirect. The relationship between density and prevalence merits more investigation. Most hantavirus hosts are habitat generalists and their control is challenging. Incorporating all potential factors and their interactions is essential to understanding and controlling infection in host populations.

AB  - A wide range of intractable problems such as polluting emissions, noise. accidents, resource depletion, and inaccessibility of amenities are associated with the current transport regime. Given the slow movement towards a more sustainable mobility system, more radical, systemic innovation - a 'transition' - is required. Broadly speaking, this may be achieved via three routes: technological change, modal shift, and reduced travel demand. Drawing on concepts from the transitions literature (e.g., [Geels. F.W.: Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-Technical Analysis, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2005.]), we conceptualise each of these routes as a bundle of niche activities within an Area of Innovation, deviating to differing degrees from the current mobility 'regime'. We present empirical evidence and indications of ongoing development of niches in these three areas within the UK and Sweden, and explore processes of co-evolution, divergence and tension within and between niches. Findings indicate recent market penetration of novel transport technologies, more advanced than modal shift or demand management activities; however, different transport technologies are more successful in each country. We also identify examples of a close relationship between development of radical vehicle/fuel technologies and provision of mobility services; and information technology as a driver in all three areas of innovation. We conclude that future innovation in transport depends on diversity, hybridisation, and co-evolution of niches. Finally, policy implications are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The three most invasive rat species, black or ship rat Rattus rattus, brown or Norway rats, R. norvegicus and Pacific rat, R. exulans have been incrementally introduced to islands as humans have explored the world's oceans. They have caused serious deleterious effects through predation and competition, and extinction of many species on tropical islands, many of which are biodiversity hotspots. All three rat species are found in virtually all habitat types, including mangrove and arid shrub land. Black rats tend to dominate the literature but despite this the population biology of invasive rats, particularly Norway rats, is poorly researched on tropical islands. Pacific rats can often exceed population densities of well over 100 rats ha(-1) and black rats can attain densities of 119 rats ha(-1), which is much higher than recorded on most temperate islands. High densities are possibly due to high recruitment of young although the data to support this are limited. The generally aseasonally warm climate can lead to year-round breeding but can be restricted by either density-dependent effects interacting with resource constraints often due to aridity. Apparent adverse impacts on birds have been well recorded and almost all tropical seabirds and land birds can be affected by rats. On the Pacific islands, black rats have added to declines and extinctions of land birds caused initially by Pacific rats. Rats have likely caused unrecorded extinctions of native species on tropical islands. Further research required on invasive rats on tropical islands includes the drivers of population growth and carrying capacities that result in high densities and how these differ to temperate islands, habitat use of rats in tropical vegetation types and interactions with other tropical species, particularly the reptiles and invertebrates, including crustaceans.

AB  - In recent years, the potential of the forest-based bioeconomy to provide competitiveness, differentiation, and sustainability to the European economy has often been claimed. Interestingly, regions, as territorial units with their own political and socioeconomic strategies, have been highlighted as the most suitable targets for the development of the European forest-based bioeconomy. Here, using the case method, we evaluated the development of the forest-based bioeconomy in three European regions (i.e., North Karelia in Finland, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, the Basque Country in Spain), by appraising the status of 10 previously identified key drivers through primary (interviews with experts) and secondary (literature review) sources of information. In our analysis, North Karelia and the Basque Country obtained the highest and lowest score, respectively, with regard to forest-based bioeconomy development. In any case, for the successful development of the forest-based bioeconomy in a European region, it is essential to accept the unnegotiable, critically, of the long-term sustainability of forest bioresources and production processes, as well as the need to foster the required changes in consumption patterns.

AB  - This study evaluates the wastewater from a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) producing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The aim is to improve the use of the nutrient solution by growing vegetables in semi-closed-loop production. The circular food production concept provides a sustainable way of producing more food from the same water and nutrient sources. The trials were carried out at the aquaponics research facility at NIBIO Landvik, Norway. The salmon production and the growth of hydroponic-produced lettuce in the fish wastewater were followed. The trial period was ten months, and the salmon grew from 40-g fingerlings up to 2.6 kg. In an aquaponic system, sludge handling and water treatment are crucial to obtain the best use of nutrients and aim for zero CO2 emissions. We sampled the fish and plant biomass, CO2 levels in the aquaculture water, the air and plant area, the sludge and the circulated production water without adding anything but pH level adjustments. The main findings showed that the biogenic CO2 produced by the fish was a good source for growing healthy plants (plants:fish = 8.57:1). Wastewater from the fish tanks is reused, holding essential nutrients in the system that otherwise would turn into waste. Our C mass balance was 103.1 (feed)-35.0 (fish)-46.3 (plants) = 21.8 (sludge, respiration, etc.) The study showed that the fresh weight ratio of lettuce production vs. salmon production was close to 9:1, which is higher than in earlier studies. Our study showed that plant production, together with RAS, reduces CO2 leakage into the atmosphere if making biochar from plant waste. The findings support a new future food platform combining different production methods and reusing waste streams as significant resources for other productions.

AB  - The preparation of natural bracken (Pteridium aquilinum L. Kuhn) from the field to a compost suitable for acid loving plants is described. Key chemical and physical characteristics of the compost were determined by laboratory assessments of particle size, pH, air filled porosity (AFP), water retention characteristics, nitrogen draw down index (NDI) and basic chemistry. The procedure to ensure the breakdown of Ptaquiloside carcinogens is discussed. The material is naturally N poor, K rich with pH < 5.0, at cutting. During composting, particle size declines but pH naturally rises. Options to retain low pH and improve the water holding capacity are discussed. Nitrogen lock-up is similar to peat, but conductivity is lower, making nutrient management of pot plants easy. Water management is the key to successful use in the nursery. This plant is a highly sustainable resource, regaining biomass if cut in alternate years, growing along the western oceanic areas of Europe, particularly on light acid soils, from Norway to Spain and from Ireland eastward beyond Germany.

AB  - The Atlantic herring Clupea harengus L has a vast geographical distribution and a complex population structure with a few very large migratory units and many small local populations. Each population has its own spawning ground and/or time, thereby maintaining their genetic integrity. Several herring populations migrate between common feeding grounds and over-wintering areas resulting in frequent mixing of populations. Thus, many herring fisheries are based on mixed populations of different demographic status. In order to avoid over-exploitation of weak populations and to conserve biodiversity, understanding the population structure and population mixing is important for maintaining biologically sustainable herring fisheries. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic population structure of herring in the Faroese and surrounding waters, and to develop genetic markers for distinguishing between four herring management units (often called stocks), namely the Norwegian spring-spawning herring (NSSH), Icelandic summer-spawning herring (ISSH), North Sea autumn-spawning herring (NSAH), and Faroese autumn-spawning herring (FASH). Herring from the four stocks were sequenced at low coverage, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called and used for population structure analysis and individual assignment. An ancestry-informative SNP panel with 118 SNPs was developed and tested on 240 individuals. The results showed that all four stocks appeared to be genetically differentiated populations, but at lower levels of differentiation between FASH and ISSH than the other two populations. Overall assignment rate with the SNP panel was 80.7%, and agreement between the genetic and traditional visual assignment was 75.5%. The NSAH and NSSH samples had the highest assignment rate (100% and 98.3%, respectively) and highest agreement between traditional and genetic assignment methods (96.6% and 94.9%, respectively). The FASH and ISSH samples had substantially lower assignment rates (72.9% and 51.7%, respectively) and agreement between traditional and genetic methods (39.5% and 48.4%, respectively)

AB  - The density of adult (greater than or equal to 3 years) female brown bears Ursus arctos was estimated in two areas of Sweden from ratios of radio-marked and unmarked females consorting with radio-marked adult males during the breeding season. The resulting densities were 1.2 +/- 0.81 (95% confidence interval) adult females/1000 km(2) in a northern study area and 1.06 +/- 3.44 adult females/1000 km(2) in a southern area. These estimates were extrapolated to obtain a population estimate for Sweden using relative densities throughout the range of the species in Sweden, based on hunter-kill statistics, and observed rates of reproduction and juvenile and subadult survival. The total population in spring 1991 was estimated to be about 620 bears, with almost all females confined to four geographically separated areas, termed female core areas. A supplementary estimate, based on estimated kill rates of adult females in the study areas, was about 660 bears. Estimates based on hunter kill rates of marked bears gave minimum and maximum estimates of about 300 and 900 bears, respectively. Although these are not confidence intervals of the total population estimate, we believe that the true population size is included within these limits. Densities within the female cove areas varied from 50 to 100% of those in similar habitats in European Russia. The bear population in Sweden appeared to have increased at a stable rate of about 1.5% annually during the past 50 years. Mean annual rate of legal harvest during 1943-1991 was estimated to be 55% (+/- 2.1% SD), suggesting a maximum sustainable rate of 7.0% for this population. The harvest increased at a rate of 9.6% annually during 1981-1991, and apparently was at the maximum sustainable level during 1987-91.

AB  - Conversion of historical to modern forest management regimes can have profound effects on understorey diversity and composition, because overstorey changes affect environmental conditions in the herbaceous layer.
   Management-driven changes (1957/1967-2005) in the overstorey of two temperate, deciduous forests generated nine conversion types in a set of 255 semi-permanent plots formerly managed as coppice-with-standards. Dominant canopy cover shifted from the shrub to the tree layer in all conversion types. Tree and shrub richness decreased significantly for most conversion types. Differences in forest structure (uneven-aged vs. even-aged), changes in litter quality and overstorey permeability for light characterised each conversion.
   We determined temporal changes in herb layer cover, species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity for each conversion. We tested if herbaceous species composition for each conversion type changed between 1957/1967 and 2005 in terms of among plot variability in species composition (multivariate dispersion) and directional changes in average composition (composition shift). Differential changes in richness, cover, litter quality and shade casting ability of the overstorey were related to changes in herb layer species or ecological groups of species across conversions.
   Total herb layer cover increased (mainly related to Anemone nemorosa, Hyacinthoides non-scripta or Rubus fruticosus agg.), except where Beech was planted on poor soils. Richness increased where litter quality increased and decreased only on strongly shaded poor soils. Decreased/increased multivariate dispersion coincided with decreased/increased richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity. Furthermore, only conversions to even-aged stands, except for Oak on poor soils, had strong composition shifts which were reflected by an increase of indifferent/acidophilous species and species with wide amplitude. For gradual conversions to uneven-aged high forest, the edaphic changes caused by altered overstorey composition were reflected in the understorey.
   In the absence of incentives to reinitiate traditional management, conserving the understorey community is best achieved by a continuation of former overstorey species composition and unevenaged high forest management. Beech plantations caused strong and negative effects, but as it is a climax species, Beech could still be used in spatiotemporal mixtures with soil improving species. Favouring or introducing the latter species can improve edaphic conditions of acid-sensitive poor soils due to their high-litter quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on the demography and reproduction of marine species provide important information for a sustainable fisheries management. We show that the size at onset of maturity in female Nephrops norvegicus has been in decline for over 20years and has always been above the established minimum landing size (MLS) in the Western Irish Sea. Determining the size at onset of maturity is one important factor to inform an effective MLS, such that individuals can reproduce at least once. The length at which half of females are sexually mature (L-50) in the overall population declined by over 12% in two decades, from 23.6mm in 1997 to 20.6mm in 2016, while the MLS has remained at 20mm. While L-50 values differ among permanent sampling stations, the decline was observed at all stations. Current practice thus allows immature females to be landed before they reproduce and contribute to recruitment. While it is not always possible to identify the determining factors that drive the decline in SOM, we argue that it is appropriate to recognize this as an indicator of declining system productivity.

AB  - Seabird populations have declined worldwide, and several of the potential threats are of anthropogenic origin. To understand how changes in seabird populations relate to environmental conditions it is important to know the functional relationships between prey availability and foraging behaviour, prey choice and breeding performance over several years. This was studied by linking breeding success of European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis to variation in diet composition, and investigating the underlaying mechanism driving this variation, primarily based on behavioural costs associated with foraging, such as foraging range and diving effort. We obtained demographic data and foraging trip metrics (using GPS-loggers and time-depth recorders) from a shag colony at Sklinna, Central Norway, during the 2011-2016 breeding seasons. Breeding population size was closely and positively correlated with breeding success, which in turn was positively correlated with the proportion of saithe Pollachius virens in the diet. When the dietary proportion of uncommon prey species increased, breeding success decreased. Breeding success was negatively influenced by increasing distance travelled and accumulated dive depths on an annual basis. Summed dive depths were greatest when prey species other than saithe dominated the diet. We found that in years with low availability of saithe fewer shags bred, and those that did had lower breeding success. This indicates that in years with poor feeding conditions, there might not be sufficient resources in the foraging area to support the whole breeding population of shags.

AB  - Protected areas pose a major interest in the current context in which natural habitats are very fragmented as a result of economic development. The ROSCI0076 Dealul Mare-Hirlau site represents the largest protected area from Moldova's Plateau where forest habitats occupy a majority surface. A total number of 10 Natura 2000 forest habitats were identified on the site's surface. Among them, the majority are 91Y0 - Dacian oak hornbeam forests and 9130 - Asperulo-Fagetum beech forests. These are comprised of 79% natural forests, while planted forests represent 19%. The main age ranges between 40 and 80 years, with compact areas with young forests, as well as with forests older than 100 years. Forest habitats are stable from an ecological point of view, ensuring optimum conditions for the development and colonization of species presented on the site's map.

AB  - Hong Kong is experiencing a pressing need for food waste management. Currently, approximately 3600 tonnes of food waste are disposed of at landfills in Hong Kong daily. The landfills in Hong Kong are expected to be exhausted by 2020. In the long run, unavoidable food waste should be sorted out from the other municipal solid waste (MSW) and then valorized into valuable resources. A simple sorting process involving less behavioural change of residents is, therefore, of paramount importance in order to encourage residents to sort the food waste from other MSW. In this paper, a sustainable framework of food waste collection and recycling for renewable biogas fuel production is proposed. For an efficient separation and collection system, an optic bag (i.e. green bag) can be used to pack the food waste, while the residual MSW can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations in the conventional way (i.e. refuse collection vehicles). At the refuse transfer stations, the food waste is separated from the residual MSW using optic sensors which recognize the colours of the bags. The food waste in the optic bags is then delivered to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities, in which biogas is generated following the anaerobic digestion technology. The biogas can be further upgraded via gas upgrading units to a quality suitable for use as a vehicle biogas fuel. The use of biogas fuel from food waste has been widely practiced by some countries such as Sweden, France, and Norway. Hopefully, the proposed framework can provide the epitome of the waste-to-wealth concept for the sustainable collection and recycling of food waste in Hong Kong.(c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Barents Sea ecosystem is a polar system with high biological production. Production takes place during a short season, mainly along the ice margin. As biological production is very limited in both space and time, the ecosystem is vulnerable to the influence of human activity.
   Fishing activity represents the most significant environmental load by man on the Barents Sea. In recent years offshore oil and gas exploration activity has increased, resulting in environmental problems as well as conflicts with fishing operations.
   Heavy metals and organic contaminants of man-made origin have been observed in both sediments and organisms at different trophic levels. Both long-range atmospheric transport and transport by ocean currents are important. Organic contaminants accumulate mainly in the body fat of the organisms; northern ecosystems are therefore especially vulnerable because fat has much greater ecological importance in such systems than in more southerly ecosystems.
   In recent years there has been public concern in both Norway and Russia over the possibility of radioactive pollution. Nuclear power plants, nuclear vessels and weapons are present in the area and produce radioactive wastes. Reports of wastes have influenced public opinion in many countries.
   The Barents Sea is strongly influenced by ocean climate variations. Global climate models forecast that the most elevated ocean temperatures due to possible greenhouse effects will probably occur in polar regions.

AB  - Cities throughout the world have increasingly promoted walking and cycling as healthy and sustainable modes of travel. However, collisions between pedestrians and cyclists have remained largely unstudied, and existing accident statistics suffer from underreporting. This study aimed to explore near accidents and collisions between pedestrians and cyclists, assess the frequency of near accidents, and evaluate pedestrians' and cyclists' sense of safety in traffic. An online survey was directed to inhabitants of Finnish cities with populations greater than 100,000, and the resulting data included 1046 respondents who walk and/or cycle regularly. The main results show that near accidents between pedestrians and cyclists are around 50 times more frequent than collisions. Only 16 survey respondents had been involved in a collision during the 3-year period, whereas roughly a third had experienced at least one near accident. For both near accidents and collisions, the involved parties were usually travelling in the same direction. Most incidents occurred on pedestrian paths and shared pedestrian and bicycle paths. On shared pedestrian and bicycle paths separated by mode of transport, incidents were much rarer. Furthermore, sense of safety and willingness to walk and cycle were lower in environments where near accidents were more frequent. These findings tentatively suggest that spatially separating modes of transport could improve people's sense of safety and prevent near accidents and collisions. Prevention of near accidents could increase the willingness to walk and cycle.

AB  - Collaborative consumption-through sharing services-has been promoted as an important step in transforming current consumption patterns toward more sustainable practices. Whilst there are high expectations for sharing services, there are few studies on the potential environmental benefits and impacts of sharing services. This study aims to analyze the potential environmental impacts of a peer-to-peer (P2P) product sharing platform and potential integration with a package drop-off/pick-up service in the urban district of Hammarby Sjostad, Stockholm, Sweden. A life cycle approach is adopted, taking into account product lifetime and use, the potential replacement of conventional products and services, impacts from digital infrastructure and their impacts on the environment. The results indicate that there is significant potential for these sharing services to reduce environmental impacts associated with production and consumption; primarily through avoiding production and reducing the production impacts of new product purchases. The results also illustrate potential synergies to integrate with the package drop-off/pick up service; where the impacts from shared products are further reduced by reducing transportation impacts through improved logistics. However, the results are dependent upon, and sensitive to, a number of methodological choices and assumptions; highlighting the need for greater knowledge on the use environmental assessments of sharing services.

AB  - The shipping sector is encountering remarkable costs concerning decarbonization of the maritime business. Both the International Maritime Organization and the European Union are developing tools to limit greenhouse gas emissions of shipping. Given all the tools and planned regulations, it seems that energy efficiency and cost cutting would be a feasible strategy of the future. However, in addition to cost cutting, shipping with net-zero or zero emission fuels might be a way to promote sustainable shipping services. A growing consumer segment is ready to pay for sustainability-marketed consumer goods, and it is possible that people would be ready to pay for net-zero or zero emission shipping as well. Our objective is to pinpoint, how big price premiums would be needed to cover the costs of shipping with sustainable, and typically more expensive, maritime fuels. We do this by calculating the amounts of fuel needed to ship specific good categories at first, and then we estimate the costs of shipping these goods with alternative fuels. We analyze Finnish maritime foreign trade during the year 2018, the time prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate fuel consumption to the value and quantities of goods. Our findings indicate that a shift to low carbon and carbon neutral fuels would have a limited effect to the price of most goods.

AB  - The increasing amount of global waste reflects the social, environmental, and economic trajectories of the local environment. This study addresses this multifaceted problem that requires a holistic view with an ecosystem-level perspective on waste. The research objective is to analyze how the waste business ecosystem enables value capture and creation. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by using a business ecosystem approach that acknowledges several stakeholders, value networks, and the social and environmental issues of the local environment. We qualitatively examine the structure and process of value capture in the waste business ecosystem in two different environments, Finland and Sao Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil. We identify the key stakeholders and their roles, as well as contrast the waste business ecosystem between a developing country and a developed country to unveil differences in value networks. The comparative qualitative case study described relies on the interview and observation of multiple stakeholders. Theoretically, this research builds on the business ecosystem literature, value capture and creation literature, and the extant literature on waste business management As its key result, the study maps two different ecosysteins and their value creation and value capture mechanisms. The findings show that notwithstanding the strong role of regulators in both local environments and their business ecosystems, some private companies engage in value capture. However, the process and structure of the value capture differ in the two case studies. We also found that the stakeholders and their roles in the value capture structure and process vary between these two local environments and with regard to collaboration for value creation. In Finland, ecosystem-level value creation is not rare, but in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, business models are typically single-firm-centric in terms of value creation and capture. The results presented in this paper delineate and structure the waste business ecosystems in both local environments and provide implications for stakeholders by suggesting the value capture trajectories that can be reached. Finally, fruitful avenues for further research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bears often rely on soft or hard mast during fall hyperphagia when they increase body mass in preparation for winter hibernation. Studies of North American and Japanese bear populations suggest they respond to years of mast crop failure by increasing movement rates and roaming farther, with an increase in human-wildlife conflicts. In southcentral Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) primarily feed on bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea) during hyperphagia. We hypothesized that berry production affects movement, activity, and space use behaviors of bears in Sweden, which have the potential to increase human-bear encounters. We tested whether seasonal activity patterns, human settlement visits, and clearcut selection ratios were affected by bilberry and lingonberry productivity between 2007 and 2017 with linear and generalized linear mixed effect models. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find that bears moved more or maintained larger home ranges in years of low berry production. Bears were slightly more active in years of higher bilberry production, but variation in behavior was primarily explained by demographic group and individual differences. Bears rarely visited human settlements and the number of visits did not increase in relation to shortage of natural foods. Likewise, population-level selection for clearcuts was unrelated to berry production but reflected a differential food search behavior in the 2 peak berry seasons, with higher clearcut selection ratios during the lingonberry season. Only 12 bears regularly used agricultural fields, which were too few to relate field visits to berry production, but all bears visited fields more often during the later lingonberry season. We suggest that weaker fluctuations in berry production, a continuous spatial distribution of berries, and an apparent absence of forage-limiting exploitative intra- or interspecific competition contribute to brown bears in Scandinavia being less food limited than bears in North America or Japan, which might help to explain the low number of human-bear conflicts in Sweden. Factors potentially influencing encounters and actual or perceived conflict between bears and humans differ among populations because of a different distribution of natural and non-natural food resources or differences in the magnitude of variation in food abundance among years. These data are important to consider when communicating causes of human-wildlife conflicts to the public. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The European breeding range of the three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus overlaps with the distribution range of coniferous and mixed forests with the dominance of Norway spruce Picea abies or European silver fir Abies alba. The paper describes a new breeding site of the three-toed woodpecker in the Sobibor Forest, eastern Poland outside the distribution range of these two tree species and its possible relationship with Eurasian beaver Castor fiber. The birds occurred in dead alder forests and were recorded 3-4 years after the forest started to decline due to the high level of surface waters associated with the keystone role of the beaver. The decay cycle of trees was possible because the area settled by woodpeckers was protected as a nature reserve.

AB  - Food waste is a major problem in modern society and carries considerable social, economic and environmental costs. Food production causes greenhouse gas emissions along the entire food supply chain and wasting food means that those emissions are produced in vain. There is consensus that food waste has to be reduced. For example, the EU and some of its member countries have set concrete targets to reduce the amount of waste. However, in order to achieve the overall goal of a more sustainable economy, not only quantitative but also environmental indicators have to be considered when pursuing waste reduction goals. This study analysed the discrepancies between the waste quantity and wastage carbon footprint (CF) profiles of perishable food products wasted in Swedish supermarkets.
   The wastage CF, defined as the product CF from cradle up to and including delivery to the retailer times the amount of the product wasted at the store, was calculated for products in the meat, deli, cheese, dairy and fruit & vegetable departments of six Swedish supermarkets. The CF from cradle to retailer of the various products was determined based on existing life cycle assessment (LCA) literature. Emissions due to production and transportation were considered. Data on wasted mass of the products in the period 2010-2012 was provided by the Swedish retail chain Willys. Data on bread waste are mainly held by the bakeries, and were thus not included in the study.
   Over a three-year period, 1570 t of fresh food (excluding bread) were wasted in the six supermarkets. The associated total wastage CF was 2500 t CO(2)e. The fruit & vegetable department contributed 85% of the wasted mass and 46% of the total wastage CF. The meat department contributed 3.5% of the wasted mass, while it accounted for 29% of the total wastage CF. The wastage CF of each department tended to be highly concentrated in certain products and thus halving the waste of the top three products in each department could save more than 25 t CO(2)e per store and year.

AB  - Aquaculture represents the fastest growing food sector and the second largest export commodity in Norway. Disease in aquaculture causes mortality and huge losses in farmed fish. Probiotic treatment of farmed fish, i.e. feeding of fish with live, beneficial microorganisms, may represent one part of a sustainable solution to these problems. Some carnobacteria of fish origin have shown promising results as probiotics for fish. In this study, two Carnobacterium divergens strains were fed to Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae through intermittent feeding with Artemia franciscana containing the bacterial strains. Cod larvae fed with the carnobacteria showed a significantly higher growth and survival during the larval rearing stage compared to the larvae fed A. franciscana with no carnobacteria (control treatment). Following the probiotic feeding period, the cod larvae were challenged with a pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio anguillarum. Cod larvae from probiotic treatment showed significantly better disease resistance compared to the control. Microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing verified that enrichment of carnobacteria in the A. franciscana feed. Analysis of the whole larvae detected only minor relative levels of carnobacteria in the probiotic treated larvae, which was non-significant compared to the control larvae (p = 0.062). The probiotic treatment had no significant impact on the overall microbiota diversity or composition in the larvae during the probiotic feeding period or after the disease challenge. Despite this, significantly improved growth and survival during larval rearing and post-pathogen challenge suggest probiotic effects of C. divergens mixture on cod larval fish performance and welfare. Studies examining the mode of action should be carried out to get more insight to lead to the commercial application of C. divergens in Atlantic cod larviculture.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)-contaminated sites are widespread and associated with a variety of anthropogenic sources. PCDDs and other organohalide pollutants can serve as terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration by specialized bacteria containing reductive dehalogenases (RdhA). These microorganisms, therefore, play an important role in the bioremediation of PCDD-contaminated sites. Two anaerobic enrichment cultures established using sediments collected from the PCDD-polluted Hackensack (USA) and Kymijoki (Finland) rivers showed robust reductive dechlorination of 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1,2,3,4-TeCDD). Here, we report on the draft genome reconstructions of the two predominant Dehalococcoides strains from the metagenomes of these dehalogenating enrichment cultures. Furthermore, we gathered a complete list of RdhA in the two predominant Dehalococcoides strains, and determined which are likely to be responsible for the reductive dechlorination of PCDDs. The divergent rdhA gene profiles of the Dehalococcoides strains likely reflect their exposure to different organohalide compounds in their original habitats. Both draft genomes contained a full length rdhA gene with high sequence similarity to a rdhA gene, i.e. cbrA, found in Dehalococcoides mccartyi CBDB1 known to reductively dechlorinate 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene. This gene homologue might also be responsible for reductive dechlorination of 1,2,3,4-TeCDD in the enrichments and could be used as a biomarker to determine the potential for the bioremediation of PCDD-contaminated sediments.

AB  - An objective of mountain forest management is to increase the ability of forest stands to protect human activities against natural hazards such as rock-falls and snow avalanches in a sustainable way. The challenge is to find a compromise between efficient instantaneous protection, favoured by dense stands, and continuous renewal, minimizing time periods of low protection efficiency. We used a Norway spruce stand dynamics model to compare the respective advantages of individual tree and gap selection silviculture in this context. We simulated stand dynamics over 800 years with either individual tree or gap thinning every 20 years with several thinning intensities. At each time step, we evaluated stand resilience, protection efficiency against rock-falls, protection efficiency against avalanches, and structural complexity with four indicators based on stand structure. Every scenario produced short time periods with low stand resilience and protection efficiency. Such periods can be tolerated if they are sufficiently rare compared to the local disturbance regime. We characterized the permanence of resilience and protection of a forest stand as its ability to remain within boundary values of the different indicators, without going out of them during continuous time periods longer than fixed maximum durations. Permanence of resilience and permanence of protection decreased with thinning intensity. Efficient protection against rock-falls was obtained with gap thinning of intermediate intensity while protection against avalanches was obtained only for very low thinning intensities. For our ecological context, the best compromise between resilience and protection was obtained with three 10 m radius gaps per hectare every 20 years (9.5% of the area of a stand). This strategy led to uneven-aged stand structures with a high diversity of diameters classes. Our results suggest that small gap silviculture may be a good way to combine forest renewal and protection efficiency in mountain regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the need to address environmental concerns in mining and the demand for critical metals and minerals increase, historical tailings are among the mining waste repositories being sought after. However, there is only limited information available about such repositories, and hence there is a need to fill these knowledge gaps. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed for how relevant information about historical tailings can be generated and structured in a systematic manner. The case of the closed Yxsjo center dot berg mine in Sweden is used to demonstrate how this framework is being used. A site-specific sampling strategy and technique was identified, and based on the observed lithology, tailings particles were studied to understand their distribution across the repository. Using Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA), the modal mineralogy, mineral associations, and mineral liberation by particle size of the tailings were determined. The Smaltja center dot rnen tailings repository of Yxsjo center dot berg has potential for critical metals and minerals, including tungsten (W) and fluorite (CaF2) but also contains minerals of environmental concern as pyrrhotite and pyrite. It has on average 0.15% WO3 concentration in the sampled locations, indicating approximately 3300 tons of WO3 in the repository. Scheelite mineral grains are mostly (>50 wt%) locked in tailings particles that have a number of mineral grains (binary, ternary or even more complex) in the dominating particle size fraction -600 to +149 mu m. Mineral locking is mostly with calciumbearing minerals ilvaite, fluorite and garnet-gross-andradite. Pyrrhotite has been the most reactive acidgenerating mineral, and hence is more depleted than pyrite in the weathered locations. The heterogeneity of tailings across the repository suggests a possible existence of geometallurgical domains that require further assessment to evaluate their metallurgical performance. The obtained information and knowledge about these tailings will hereinafter be used to develop sustainable processes for remediation and recovery of the critical metals and minerals.

AB  - Today already all of us know, that corruption is extremely diverse, in various degrees it amazes practically all layers of our society - from the beggar to the large government official or the deputy whom for a good bribe much can make. A characteristic sign of modern corruption is the conflict between actions of the official and interests of its employer or the conflict between actions of the elective person and interests of a society. In process of strengthening of political parties and the state regulation, episodes of arrangement of political elite and large business began to cause growing concern. Globalization has led to that corruption in One Country began to affect negatively development of many countries. Not casually for propagation of knowledge of United Nations corruption founded the International day of struggle against corruption. Because Ukraine has got the status of the country with market economy, corruption scales as a result only have increased. In our country all areas, both state management, and local government are subject to corruption practically. Unfortunately, corruption actions in sphere of protection of environment and maintenance of safety of ability to live of the person are especially extended, In the report typical corruption schemes in these areas are considered and classified, the reasons of increase in scale of corruption are analyzed and possible directions not elimination are defined, it essentially while is hardly possible, and at least decrease in harmful influence of corruption in spheres of management, a science, the services, are connected with ecology and safety of ability to live. Real successes can achieve if to pay the basic attention thus to realization of principles of the concept of a sustainable development (SD) with the decision of ecological, economic and social problems at the expense of orientation to development of an average and a small-scale business, use of high innovative potential and market mechanisms of managing on the basis of the system analysis and modern information technologies. Especially effective there will be in struggle against the corruption phenomena use of the indexes of stability of development offered in SD for an expert estimation of correctness of the chosen decision and competitive, tender mechanisms of a choice of the project. Besides, it is necessary to provide the maximum transparency, wide scientific discussion of the most important directions of the development, most ecologically dangerous projects and specific proposals on their realization. As an example of a successful anticorruption policy, they often mention the Swedish experience. There the independent and effective system of justice has been created. Simultaneously Swedish parliament and the government have established high ethical standards for managers and their execution began to achieve. After all some years honesty became social norm among bureaucracy. Salaries of the high-ranking officials first exceeded earnings of workers at 12-15 times, however eventually this difference has decreased to the double. For today Sweden has one of the lowest levels of corruption in the world. And, nevertheless, in Ukraine tactics of decrease in corruption should be constructed on a number of vertical measures: regulations of actions of officials, simplification of bureaucratic procedures, strict supervision over observance of high ethical standards.
   Probably, by experience of other Countries, it is necessary to create a special Bureau on investigation of cases of corruption in which citizens could address ith complaints to state employees and demand the indemnification. It essentially would increase at once filling of the budget of the country. Simultaneously with it followed toughen the legislation, to raise independence of judicial system, to enter economic sanctions for bribery or refusal of participation in anticorruption investigations.

AB  - This paper explores youths' language activism at a Swedish senior high school. Following Cameron (Verbal hygiene, Routledge, Florence, 1995), this paper investigates language activism as 'verbal hygiene', with a focus on the social dimension of students' attempts to change how language is used at the school. To capture how the politically motivated language activism came to produce political subjectivities and delineation between social groups, and also to impact the distribution of agency and voice in the local discursive regime, I combine Cameron's (Verbal hygiene, Routledge, Florence, 1995) notion of verbal hygiene with recent theorizing on affect (Ahmed in The cultural politics of emotion, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 2004; Sedgwick in Touching feeling: affect, pedagogy, performativity, Duke University Press, Durham, 2003; Wetherell in Affect and emotion: a new social science understanding, Sage, London, 2012). Inspired by studies of semiotic landscapes (Jaworski and Thurlow in Semiotic landscapes: language, image, space, Bloomsbury Academic, London, 2011), the data includes posters and other signage in the high school, as well as recordings of naturally occurring interaction and interviews. The analysis shows how shame is pivotal in the processes of language activism at the school and how this activism, being an emancipatory project, both produces political subjectivities as well as new linguistic normativities and hierarchies.

AB  - Instagram started in San Francisco, yet it has been clear that its usage has spread worldwide. The influence of this global outreach is apparent not only in the platform's general use, however, but in unique content trends as well. In particular, there is Instapoetry, the movement of minimalist poetry that has taken Instagram and the rest of the world by storm since 2018. Although Instapoetry was dominated by writers based in English-speaking countries at its outset, it has now become extremely popular across multiple nations and languages, a truly transnational and translingual cultural phenomenon. As these writers emerge from a vast cultural landscape, it has become critical to examine how the various Instapoets across cultures resemble each other in some ways, yet vastly diverge in others. This series of essays seek to examine how Instapoetry as a transglobal movement evolves within its capitalistic platform, studying the manner that users may escape or re-establish digital hegemonic structures. From Malawi to Greece, India to Norway, the First Nations to Latin America, these critical pieces show how Instapoets may alternatively use social media poems as tools of weaponry, commercialisation, protest, and healing.

AB  - Harvesting beach-cast can help mitigate marine eutrophication by closing land-marine nutrient loops and provide a blue biomass raw material for the bioeconomy. Cost-benefit analysis was applied to harvest activities during 2009-2018 on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, highlighting benefits such as nutrient removal from the marine system and improved recreational opportunities as well as costs of using inputs necessary for harvest. The results indicate that the activities entailed a net gain to society, lending substance to continued funding for harvests on Gotland and assessments of upscaling of harvest activities to other areas in Sweden and elsewhere. The lessons learnt from the considerable harvest experience on Gotland should be utilized for developing concrete guidelines for carrying out sustainable harvest practice, paying due attention to local conditions but also to what can be generalized to a wider national and international context.

AB  - Many stream restoration projects aim to increase geomorphic complexity, assuming that this increases habitat heterogeneity and, thus, biodiversity. However, empirical data supporting these linkages remain scant. Previous assessments of stream restoration suffer from incomplete quantification of habitat complexity, or a narrow focus on only one organism group and/or one restoration measure, limiting learning. Based on a comprehensive quantification of geomorphic complexity in 20 stream reaches in northern Sweden, ranging from streams channelized for timber floating to restored and reference reaches, we investigated responses of macroinvertebrates, diatoms, and macrophytes to multiple geomorphic metrics. Sediment size heterogeneity, which was generally improved in restored sites, favored macroinvertebrate and diatom diversity and macroinvertebrate abundance. In contrast, macrophyte diversity responded to increased variation along the longitudinal stream profile (e.g., step-pools), which was not consistently improved by the restoration. Our analyses highlight the value of learning across multiple restoration projects, both in identifying which aspects of restoration have succeeded, and pinpointing other measures that might be targeted during adaptive management or future restoration. Given our results, a combination of restoration measures targeting not only sediment size heterogeneity, but also features such as step-pools and instream wood, is most likely to benefit benthic biota in streams.

AB  - Forests interact with the local climate through a variety of biophysical mechanisms. Observational and modelling studies have investigated the effects of forested vs. non-forested areas, but the influence of forest management on surface temperature has received far less attention owing to the inherent challenges to adapt climate models to cope with forest dynamics. Further, climate models are complex and highly parameterized, and the time and resource intensity of their use limit applications. The availability of simple yet reliable statistical models based on high resolution maps of forest attributes representative of different development stages can link individual forest management practices to local temperature changes, and ultimately support the design of improved strategies. In this study, we investigate how forest management influences local surface temperature (LSTs) in Fennoscandia through a set of machine learning algorithms. We find that more developed forests are typically associated with higher LST than young or undeveloped forests. The mean multi-model estimates from our statistical system can accurately reproduce the observed LST. Relative to the present state of Fennoscandian forests, fully develop forests are found to induce an annual mean warming of 0.26 degrees C (0.03/0.69 degrees C as 5th/95th percentile), and an average cooling effect in the summer daytime from-0.85 to-0.23 degrees C (depending on the model). On the contrary, a scenario with undeveloped forests induces an annual average cooling of-0.29 degrees C (-0.61/-0.01 degrees C), but daytime warming in the summer that can be higher than 1 degrees C. A weak annual mean cooling of-0.01 degrees C is attributed to forest harvest from 2015 to 2018, with an increased daytime temperature in summer of about 0.04 degrees C. Overall, this approach is a flexible option to study effects of forest management on LST that can be applied at various scales and for alternative management scenarios, thereby helping to improve local management strategies with consideration of effects on local climate.

AB  - As global climate continues to change, so too will phenology of a wide range of insects. Changes in flight season usually are characterised as shifts to earlier dates or means, with attention less often paid to flight season breadth or whether seasons are now skewed. We amassed flight season data for the insect order Odonata, the dragonflies and damselflies, for Norway over the past century-and-a-half to examine the form of flight season change. By means of Bayesian analyses that incorporated uncertainty relative to annual variability in survey effort, we estimated shifts in flight season mean, breadth, and skew. We focussed on flight season breadth, positing that it will track documented growing season expansion. A specific mechanism explored was shifts in voltinism, the number of generations per year, which tends to increase with warming. We found strong evidence for an increase in flight season breadth but much less for a shift in mean, with any shift of the latter tending toward a later mean. Skew has become rightward for suborder Zygoptera, the damselflies, but not for Anisoptera, the dragonflies, or for the Odonata as a whole. We found weak support for voltinism as a predictor of broader flight season; instead, voltinism acted interactively with use of human-modified habitats, including decrease in shading (e.g. from timber extraction). Other potential mechanisms that link warming with broadening of flight season include protracted emergence and cohort splitting, both of which have been documented in the Odonata. It is likely that warming-induced broadening of flight seasons of these widespread insect predators will have wide-ranging consequences for freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Mountainous vegetation in general, and especially in subpolar regions, is sensitive, compared to vegetation in lowland areas, as mountainous vegetation has low resilience and low productivity. Mountainous areas have been perceived as being sensitive to mechanical damage. Quick methods with a high degree of accuracy are needed for the monitoring of mountainous areas and for planning the sustainable use of resources. The aim was i) to investigate if the dry dwarf shrub heath on hummocky moraine in the southern part of the mountains with a maritime climate and in open areas used for summer grazing, is susceptible to change; and ii) to test if high-resolution IKONOS-2 satellite data can, with a high degree of accuracy, be used for detection, and for quantification and mapping of erosion patches in montane vegetation. In which case, these data can substitute color infrared aerial photos for the early detection of changes. For the detection of changes, visual interpretations on high-quality printouts of IKONOS-2 satellite images from 2000 and of color infrared aerial photographs from 1975 were carried out and the results compared. Interpretations were verified in the field. The results show that for the period 19752000, erosion was in process on and around wind heaths, indicating that the wind heath and surrounding dry dwarf shrub heath in this landscape type of hummocky moraine are sensitive to mechanical damage by trampling and grazing, and thus susceptible to change. Most of the wind heaths and changes found were small (50-1000 m(2)). The results show that it is possible to detect, with good accuracy, detailed changes in the size and distribution of erosion patches and wind heaths by visual interpretation in single images of IKONOS-2 data. This implies that for monitoring these kinds of changes, these high-resolution (4 x 4 m pixel resolution) satellite data can substitute for color infrared aerial photographs.

AB  - During two measurement campaigns, from August to September 2008 and 2009, we quantified the major ecosystem fluxes in a hemiboreal forest ecosystem in Jaryselja, Estonia. The main aim of this study was to separate the ecosystem flux components and gain insight into the performance of a multi-species multilayered tree stand. Carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes were measured using the eddy covariance method above and below the canopy in conjunction with the microclimate. Leaf and soil contributions were quantified separately by cuvette and chamber measurements, including fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and biogenic volatile organic compounds (isoprene and monoterpenes). The latter have been as well characterized for monoterpenes in detail. Based on measured atmospheric trace gas concentrations, the flux tower site can be characterized as remote and rural with low anthropogenic disturbances.
   Our results presented here encourage future experimental efforts to be directed towards year round integrated biosphere-atmosphere measurements and development of process-oriented models of forest-atmosphere exchange taking the special case of a multi-layered and multi-species tree stand into account. As climate change likely leads to spatial extension of hemiboreal forest ecosystems a deep understanding of the processes and interactions therein is needed to foster management and mitigation strategies.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that Atlantic salmon parr grew suboptimally according to the water temperature regime during the ice-free season (from May to September) in the subarctic River Reisa (northern Norway). A laboratory-based growth model was used to estimate the optimal growth which was then compared with the observed growth of the parr in the river. Water temperatures were recorded every second hour with a submersible data logger, and observed and predicted growth of several age classes were compared at two nearby nursery habitats. Except for parr aged 2, most age classes showed no significant change, or even a weight loss, from May to July, whereas from July to September, positive growth was found for all age classes coinciding with favourable temperatures above a critical temperature for growth. The parr growth rates were suboptimal, being lower than the predicted values, but values for observed and predicted body mass were not significantly different in five of 12 comparisons. Hence, the fish were sometimes unable to grow according to the optimal baseline set by the temperature regime. Therefore, factors other than temperature, such as limited food resources and resource competition, may also be a major determinant of Atlantic salmon parr growth. Our study demonstrates how growth predictions based on mathematical models may be employed by fish ecologists to identify growth deficiencies in wild fish populations.

AB  - The keystone piscivore northern pike Esox lucius can structure fish communities, and models predicting pike-focused connectivity will be important for management of many waters.
   We explored the ability of pike to colonize upstream locations and modelled presence-absence in lakes based on landscape features derived from maps. An upstream connectivity model (UC model) was generated using data from 87 lakes. We validated the UC model with retrospective whole-lake experiments involving introductions (n = 49) and extirpations (by rotenone) of pike (n = 96), as well as with the natural distribution of pike in lakes (n = 1365) within 26 drainage basin networks in northern Sweden.
   The UC model predicted the incidence of pike in lakes with stream-connections with 95.4% accuracy, based mainly on a single variable, S-V5max, that measures the minimum distance found between 5 m elevation intervals (= maximum stream slope) along watercourses from nearest downstream source of potential immigrants. Recolonizations of pike in rotenone lakes generated a near-identical classification tree, as in the UC model. The classification accuracy of pike presence in the external validation procedure ranged from 88.7 to 98.7% between different drainage basins. Predictions of pike absence were not as accurate, due possibly to undetected introductions, but still lead to 86.6% overall accuracy of the external validation. Most lakes lacking pike, but misclassified as having pike based on low S-V5max, were isolated from downstream sources of pike by subsurface streamflow through bouldery areas (SSB).
   Synthesis and applications. The variable S-V5max provide managers with a tool for revealing the location and severity of natural dispersal barriers to pike (and logically also barriers to other species with equivalent or less dispersal capacity). Because presented models only require map-based information, and have high predictive power, they may have the potential to be of fundamental use in predicting distribution of freshwater fish. These predictions may provide the means for prioritizing in risk assessment and control programmes to combat pike invasions, as well as contribute to determining a reference state of species incidence in specific lakes. Our results also point towards a possibility that, even where stream slope is low, long-term effective barriers may be designed that mimic natural SSB.

AB  - Background
   The European Action Plan for Sexual and Reproductive Health emphasizes the importance of improving access to contraceptive services for disadvantaged groups. However, a prior study showed that the prevalence of abortion is two times higher among refugees compared to non-immigrants in Norway. Similarly, a recent study reported that 50% of Somali women in Oslo had unintended childbirth on one occasion or more. These findings are supported by several studies in Europe that showed immigrant and refugee women have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion than Non-immigrant women, and more than half of immigrants, who seek abortion are not using any form of contraception, raising concerns about their access to utilization of modern contraception. However, none of these studies have explored reasons underlying immigrant women's underutilization of modern contraception. The present study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to contraceptive usage among Somali immigrant women in Oslo area.
   Methods
   A qualitative study using unstructured in-depth interviews with twenty one Somali women of reproductive age, >18 years, was conducted in Oslo from May-August 2018. The participants were recruited using purposive sampling method. Interviews began with a general question and were followed with some probing questions, and were continued until data saturation was reached. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   Although the majority of the participants were educated, aware of the importance of contraceptive methods and interested in child spacing, systemic and socio-cultural barriers were found to be hindering their access to contraception. Several barriers were identified, including: language problems, lack of adequate information, religious beliefs, gender roles and social pressure.
   Conclusion
   Eliminating the barriers which prevent women from receiving their desired form of contraception will have important public health implications, including lengthening inter-pregnancy intervals, and fewer unplanned pregnancies and abortions. These findings can support policy makers, civil society organizations and health providers to develop cultural sensitive programmes and educational interventions, which help Somali immigrant women overcome the identified barriers to contraception.

AB  - Some previous studies showed that the formation of several deep dark humus-rich topsoils in Northern Europe was strongly influenced by the application of different organic materials by anthropogenic activities in former times. Such topsoils classified as plaggic Anthrosols also occurred in the Jaeren region in SW Norway. However, source material and formation time of these Plaggic Anthrosols have not yet been clarified. Close to this region we found further humus-rich topsoils in the Karmoy municipality (2 sites at main island of Karmoy and 1 site at Feoy). These soils show a thick humus-rich topsoil up to 30 cm, and their formation cannot only be explained by natural conditions. We analyzed the molecular signature of the soil organic matter (SOM) by benzene poly carboxylic acids (BPCA), non-targeted bulk SOM mass spectrometry, delta S-34 and C-14 AMS dating in order to determine source materials and the age of the SOM. The black carbon (BC) contents of the plaggic soils in Jaeren (mean 3.4 g kg(-1)) deliver clear evidence for inputs of combustion residues from ancient fire management and/or from settlements. The C-XANES and Py-FIMS-spectra reveal relative enrichments of aromatic C and heterocyclic N compounds in the plaggic soils corresponding to the BC contents. In contrast, the humus-rich topsoils in Karmoy seem to be unaffected by fire management due to the low BC contents (mean 0.6 g kg(-1)) and the relative low portions of aromatic C and heterocyclic N compounds from C-XANES and Py-FIMS. The delta S-34 isotope signature of the SOM ranged from 10.6 to 15.2 parts per thousand in the soils at the islands and 10.0 to 13.5 parts per thousand in Jaeren, corresponding to the Anthrosols in the Baltic Sea region (Median: delta S-34 = 11.5 parts per thousand) and suggest an input of marine biomass (delta S-34 of seaweed = 20 parts per thousand). The AMS C-14 dating and complementary archaeological literature implied that the soils in Jaeren and Karmoy have been formed between the Roman Iron Age (500 BC to AD 500) and the Viking Age (AD 800 to AD 1,000). Our results provide strong evidence for an anthropo-pedogenesis of the humus-rich topsoils in Karmoy and indicate parallels to the plaggic soils in Jaeren as well as to Anthrosols in the Baltic Sea region. Therefore, we propose to classify the humus-rich topsoils in Karmoy as Anthrosols.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) records from the southern Nordic Seas were compiled in order to evaluate the evolution of upper ocean conditions, on a millennial timescale and supported by a highly resolved record from the Voring Plateau. After the transitional phase from the last deglaciation, three main phases define the Holocene. The early Holocene (>7.5 ka BP) features important numbers of cool-temperate species dominated by Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Impagidinium pallidum in the west. The assemblage composition changes drastically at the transition from the early to the mid-Holocene, from when on Operculodinium centrocarpum dominates. The changeover is dated between similar to 6.1 and 7.5 ka BP, perhaps earlier closer to the Iceland-Scotland Ridge, and appears to be linked to the onset of a modern type of surface circulation. 'Warmest' assemblages occur at the Voring Plateau shortly after the transition, when Atlantic waters also appear to have spread farthest westward. The recurrence of colder elements can be linked to cooling from similar to 2.4 ka BP at the Voring Plateau and presumably earlier in the west but is difficult to date there because of the low sedimentation rates. This is a general issue in many areas of the Nordic Seas and appears to have an important effect on cyst concentrations and assemblage composition, with the possible loss of oxygenation-sensitive cysts in the older parts of the cores. Comparing dinocyst-based quantitative reconstructions with those retrieved from other plankton reveals a significantly different trend between proxies, linked to a differing autecological response to seasonal changes at their respective depth habitats.

AB  - The innovation literature increasingly addresses grand challenges and transformative change. However, the issue of to what extent transformative change can build upon the resources, actors and institutions of existing innovation systems has not received sufficient attention. Against this background this paper aims to advance our understanding of the geographies and continuities of transformative change, by exploring the role of regional innovation systems in mission-oriented innovation. Based on an in-depth case study of electrification of ferries in Western Norway, the paper finds that the accomplishment of the mission was in large part due to the fact that it created new regional economic opportunities and built upon and mobilized existing regional resources, actors and structures. This mission re-orientation of an existing regional innovation system was characterized by (a) limited contestation, low complexity and low uncertainty about the technological battery-driven solutions pointed at, (b) multi-actor and multi-scalar agency and finally (c) asset modification of strong and pre-existing RIS structures, institutions and regulatory context.

AB  - Recently, an extensive study of 2,748 polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from across their circumpolar range was published in PLOS ONE, which used microsatellites and mitochondrial haplotypes to apparently show altered population structure and a dramatic change in directional gene flow towards the Canadian Archipelago-an area believed to be a future refugium for polar bears as their southernmost habitats decline under climate change. Although this study represents a major international collaborative effort and promised to be a baseline for future genetics work, methodological shortcomings and errors of interpretation undermine some of the study's main conclusions. Here, we present a reanalysis of this data in which we address some of these issues, including: (1) highly unbalanced sample sizes and large amounts of systematically missing data; (2) incorrect calculation of FST and of significance levels; (3) misleading estimates of recent gene flow resulting from non-convergence of the program BAYESASS. In contrast to the original findings, in our reanalysis we find six genetic clusters of polar bears worldwide: the Hudson Bay Complex, the Western and Eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Western and Eastern Polar Basin, and-importantly-we reconfirm the presence of a unique and possibly endangered cluster of bears in Norwegian Bay near Canada's expected last sea-ice refugium. Although polar bears' abundance, distribution, and population structure will certainly be negatively affected by ongoing-and increasingly rapid-loss of Arctic sea ice, these genetic data provide no evidence of strong directional gene flow in response to recent climate change.

AB  - The management of marine living resources that straddle country borders has historically been a challenge, particularly in cases where political tensions are high. The jointly managed fisheries resources in the Barents Sea are a notable exception, wherein the Russian Federation (formerly Soviet Union) and Norway have relatively successfully managed fish stocks together since the 1950s, including during the high tensions of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Using ICES statistics as reported baseline landings, the total catch of the region by the Russian fisheries was reconstructed for the period 1950-2014. Total catch was divided into reported landings, unreported landings, and discards, and assigned to four sectors: industrial, artisanal, recreational, and subsistence. Unreported landings and discards between 1950 and 2014 accounted for similar to 12 and 55% of the total catch, respectively, with discards being substantial in the early decades. A majority of the catch was caught using pelagic and bottom trawls, contributing to the high rate of discards. Both discards and landings reached their peak in the 1970s, after which overexploitation contributed to numerous stock declines. Stocks recovered in the 1990s following adoption of legislation and gear regulations limiting discards as part of a joint effort by Norway and Russia to more sustainably manage stocks. The trend of declining Russian Barents Sea catches after the 1980s matches global trends of declining catch, although the present case appears to be mainly due to more successful management interventions. It is assumed that small-scale fisheries removals are minor in the region, but further research to refine estimates of small-scale fishing can improve upon the present study. While this study highlights historical declines in catch due to overexploitation, it does not explore fluctuations in catch caused by environmental variation. In the rapidly warming Arctic region it is of vital importance to understand how stocks may be further affected by climate change in addition to fishing pressure.

AB  - 1. Species richness is influenced by local habitat features and large-scale climatic gradients. Usually, both influences are studied in isolation because of the divergent spatial scales at which they occur. Here, we compared the influence of large-scale climate and local habitat type on European ants using a continent-wide, standardised sampling programme.
   2. We investigated species richness and activity density from pitfall traps distributed over four habitat types at 17 locations from northern Sweden to Spain and Greece. Species richness and activity density were analysed with respect to ambient energy [equilibrium evapotranspiration (EET)] and productive energy (net primary productivity). Furthermore, we compared ant richness and activity density between the four habitat types: arable land, scrubland, grassland, and forest.
   3. Species richness and activity density of ants increased with equilibrium evapotranspiration (EET), explaining 30.2% of the total variation in species richness and 24.2% of activity density. Habitat type explained an additional 19.2% of the variation in species richness and 20.2% of activity density, and was not related to productivity. Species richness and activity density were highest in scrubland and significantly lower in forest and (marginally significant) in arable land.
   4. The increase in EET and the decrease in forest confirms the pronounced thermophily of ants, whereas the decrease in arable land is probably caused by soil disturbance.

AB  - In order to plan for, and achieve, a sustainable and accessible transport system, research and policies alike recognize a need to implement and enhance alternative transport options in favor of the private car. Moreover, these sustainable alternatives need to offer sufficient levels of accessibility regardless of where people live or work. We present and discuss an approach for capturing and evaluating perceived accessibility, with the ability to differentiate between individuals. Levels of perceived accessibility are compared before and after a fictive car use restriction, and between residential areas, using data from 2711 residents of Malmo, Sweden. A main conclusion is that levels of perceived accessibility become significantly lower for car users when they are limited in their options for daily travel. The difference is more substantive for frequent car users, who already travel less by sustainable modes today. There are also significant differences in levels of perceived accessibility in the restricted scenario, depending on where individuals live. These novel findings may not come as a surprise, but they emphasize the importance of including and analyzing perceptions of car users when designing accessible and sustainable transport systems. The paper ends with a discussion on how to facilitate the transition from current transport systems to an inclusive and accessible system.

AB  - The Baltic Sea forms a dynamic marine habitat with strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in many essential environmental variables. This environmental setting controls pelagic and benthic biodiversity by providing very narrow ecological niches for species displaying varying tolerances to environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and turbidity. In this study, changes in benthic communities in relation to extreme weather conditions, such as the occurrence of heat waves (HW) and coastal upwelling (CU) events, were analyzed and described in the north-eastern Baltic Sea. In the summer of 2018, the maximum water temperatures in the studied coastal sea sections varied between 20 and 25 degrees C at 5 m depth whereby recorded values were up 7 degrees C higher compared to that of the long-term mean. However, daily water temperature showed remarkable variation due to upwelling events occurring on multiple occasions with extreme temperature shifts of 14 degrees C being recorded within a period of a few days. In the NE Baltic Sea, salinity gradient is up to 7 PSU in outer areas and it falls to zero in bays with riverine impact. Salinity has significant importance on benthic species abundance, richness and distribution. A rapid increase in salinity was observed during upwelling events. Extraordinarily, heat wave accompanied with upwelling event caused the increase of zoobenthic biodiversity and species- specific response of abundances. In contrast, the effect on macrovegetation species composition and proportion of opportunistic species was rather negative.

AB  - To describe a more sustainable food sector, a supply chain approach is needed. Changing a supply chain inevitably means that various attributes of the product and its system will change. This project assumed this challenge and delivered detailed descriptions, life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluations, and consequence assessments of the supply chains of six commodities, i.e., milk, cheese, beef, pork, chicken, and bread, from a Swedish region. This paper presents results for the pork supply chain.
   In the project setup, experts on production along supply chains designed three scenarios for environmentally improved systems. These scenarios, i.e., the ecosystem, plant nutrients, and climate scenarios, were intended to address different clusters of environmental goals. The next step was to challenge these scenarios by considering their possible consequences for products and systems from the food safety, sensory quality, animal welfare, consumer appreciation, and (for primary production only) cost perspectives. This led to changes in production system design to prevent negative consequences. The final supply chains were quantified using LCA and were again assessed from the three perspectives.
   The scenario design approach worked well, thoroughly and credibly describing the production systems. Assessment of consequences bolstered the credibility and quality of the systems and results. The LCA of pig production and smoked ham identified large potentials for improvement by implementing available knowledge: global warming potential (GWP) could be reduced 21-54 % and marine eutrophication by 14-45 %. The main reason for these improvements was improved productivity (approaching the best producers' current performance), though dedicated measures were also important, resulting in increased nitrogen efficiency, more varied crop rotations for crop production and better production management, and improved animal health and manure management for animal production. Reduced post-farm wastage contributed as did reduced emissions from fertilizer production.
   The working approach applied was successful in integrating LCA research with food system production expertise to deliver results relevant to supply chain decision-makers. The consequence assessments brought considerable value to the project, giving its results greater credibility. By introducing constraints in the form of "no negative consequences and no increased costs," the work was "guided" so that the scenario design avoided being hampered by too many opportunities.

AB  - Protein crops are important in enhancing sustainable and self-contained agriculture and food security in Europe. Individual farmers are key players in protein crop production. The aim of this research is to understand how an entrepreneurial identity affects strategic cultivation decisions in the context of protein-rich crop farming. In this study, entrepreneurial identity consists of a farmer's personal and entrepreneurial orientations. Data on 308 Finnish farmers were gathered and statistically tested. Our findings clarify that entrepreneurial identity increases the probability of beginning protein-rich crop cultivation, especially if the farmer in question is innovative, a risk-taker and highly educated. This article contributes to the understanding of agricultural entrepreneurship and strategic cultivation decisions made by different kinds of farmers. We further claim that profitable but risky and demanding crops have tempted farmers with a high entrepreneurial identity for the most part, which would not suffice for protein crops to become mainstream.

AB  - The Nordic countries aim to have a unique place within the European and global health data economy. They have extensive nationally maintained and centralized health data records, as well as numerous biobanks where data from individuals can be connected based on personal identification numbers. Much of this phenomenon can be attributed to the emergence and development of the Nordic welfare state, where Nordic countries sought to systematically collect large amounts of population data to guide decision making and improve the health and living conditions of the population. Recently, however, the so-called Nordic gold mine of data is being re-imagined in a wholly other context, where data and its ever-increasing logic of accumulation is seen as a driver for economic growth and private business development. This article explores the development of policies and strategies for health data economy in Denmark and Finland. We ask how nation states try to adjust and benefit from new pressures and opportunities to utilize their data resources in data markets. This raises questions of social sustainability in terms of states being producers, providers, and consumers of data. The data imaginaries related to emerging health data markets also provide insight into how a broad range of different data sources, ranging from hospital records and pharmacy prescriptions to biobank sample data, are brought together to enable "full-scale utilization" of health and welfare data.

AB  - In the article, on the example of the conflict of the Courland governor P.A. Valuev with the Baltic nobility, happened in 1857, the legal status of the Baltic nobility in the Russian Empire is considered. The main issue considered in the work is the problem of the relationship between the imperial center and the national outskirts in the middle of the 19th century, which, in turn, is closely related to the results of the Northern War (1700-1721), which ended for Russia with a victory over Sweden and the annexation of the former part of the Swedish kingdom Estonia and Livonia.The local aristocracy received guarantees from the highest Russian authorities to preserve all privileges, which put it in a slightly different position than the nobility of the inner Russian provinces. Under Catherine II, when Courland was incorporated into Russia, these privileges were extended to the Courland barons. In the XIX century, under Nicholas I and Alexander II, all the "rights and liberties" of the Baltic nobles were also invariably confirmed. As a result, there was a situation in which the German barons considered themselves bound by personal obligations personally with the Russian monarch. This situation, typical of medieval feudal Europe, ran counter to the Russian patrimonial socio-political model, which irritated the Russian elite. The special position of the Courland nobility eventually led to a clash with the governor P.A. Valuev, who, acting within the framework of general imperial legislation, tried to establish general imperial orders in the province. Governor-General of the Baltic Region A.A. Suvorov, Interior Minister S.S. Lanskoy and Emperor Alexander II himself were involved in the clash. And although Valuev's position ultimately triumphed, and his opponent, Baron Gan, was forced to leave the post of Courland leader of the nobility, in general, this did not change the situation in any way. The model of "center-outskirts" relations considered in the article allows a deeper analysis of the difficulties that the local administration in the Baltic region faced when trying to unify the local administration system with the general imperial one. The main conclusion of the article can be considered the thesis that the Russian central government, represented by the governor and the governor-general, did not dare to drastically break the existing management model, in which the local elite (nobility) had a significant impact on the situation in the region. Courland, along with other Baltic provinces, remained a special territory in the political and legal landscape of the Russian Empire.

AB  - 1. The development and calibration of a land-based technique to measure inter-animal spacing in free-ranging coastal cetaceans is described here. The technique was developed to study the behaviour of killer whales Orcinus orca in Norway.
   2. A theodolite was used to measure the surfacing location of one reference individual while simultaneous video recordings of the whole group were made. Digitized video frames were then used to estimate the locations of all individuals in the video frame relative to the reference animal.
   3. The technique was calibrated using a line of towed buoys with known separations. Estimated inter-buoy distances were compared with actual values to calculate errors. There was no observable bias in measurements, with a mean error of -0.014 m (n = 304, SD = 0.880). At ranges up to 2 km from the observation site, 95% of measurements were accurate to within 1.7 m.
   4. The accuracy of the measurement system was characterized with a set of Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were run at offshore ranges from 100 m to 2000 m, with random perturbations applied to all variables. Errors in inter-animal distances for n = 16 whales were estimated using 10 000 simulation runs for every range value. The results from the simulations agreed with experimental findings. The results showed no bias in inter-animal distance measurements, with an overall mean error of 0.0864 m.
   5. The results indicate that this technique is suitable for studies on a variety of coastal cetacean populations. It provides a new tool for quantitative studies on spatial behaviour of cetaceans, and will help underpin management efforts to monitor effects of anthropogenic disturbance. With modification, the technique might also be applicable to other coastal vertebrates where inter-organism distances are required.

AB  - An ongoing discussion concerns road-pricing schemes as measures to abate traffic congestion and air pollution in metropolitan areas. If such measures are to be effective, road-pricing fees must be set sufficiently high. However, municipalities are likely to have other goals besides reducing car use, such as upholding fairness among citizens and financial goals such as creating revenues. If conflicts prove to exist between different goals, road-pricing schemes are not likely to achieve the environmental goal. To investigate the degree to which these goal conflicts exist, members of the local governments in the three major metropolitan areas of Sweden responded to a survey questionnaire. In the questionnaire they rated a number of principles guiding the setting of road-pricing fees hypothesized to correspond to the three goals. The results showed that, for the political majority, the hypothesized goal conflicts existed in that no single goal was optimized. It is concluded that in particular fairness may prevent road pricing achieving the environmental goal.

AB  - The widespread invasive rodents Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, R. exulans and Mus musculus have been implicated in the decline and extinction of hundreds of island endemic vertebrates, but their effects on island invertebrates are less well-known. Here I present the first global review of the subject, which confirms that large-bodied invertebrates are most at risk from these rodents, and that although a disproportionate number of studies (69%) are from New Zealand, rodent-invertebrate impacts are geographically widespread. Mechanisms of impact are both direct (mediated by predation) and indirect (involving intermediary species). Some studies also suggest knock-on effects on ecosystem properties, and given the diverse ecological functions of invertebrates (as detritivores, primary consumers, predators, prey and pollinators). I suggest that an understanding of the interactions between invasive rodents and invertebrates in island ecosystems is essential for effective conservation management. Currently many reported impacts are unquantified, come from uncontrolled and unreplicated designs, or rely on time-series with inadequate baseline data. In addition to basic improvements in study design, this review highlights a need for studies which investigate mechanisms of impact, or impacts across trophic levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Bacterial diseases causes massive mortalities in aquaculture and antibiotic use remains the main measure to keep these under control. Pisciricketssia salmonis, an intracellular bacterium only present in Chile, produces high mortalities in farmed salmon and is currently the main reason for using antimicrobials compared to other salmon-producing countries such as Norway. Environmental and antimicrobial resistance concerns have been raised by the local and global public and society, although no scientific evidence has demonstrated such an impact. Thus, there is a constant search for new alternatives that can complement or reduce the use of antimicrobial in intensive salmon farming. Phytochemicals such as saponins from Quillaja saponaria extracts have been proven to prevent and control diseases in other animal production systems. This study explored the safety and efficacy of quillaja extract in in vitro infections with P. salmonis. The results of this study showed a good in vitro safety and efficacy to infections. The efficacy proved to be dependent on the quantity of saponins and toxicity dependent on purification. The results showed that quillaja extracts could be potentially used as a new sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to control P. salmonis infection, contributing to decreased fish mortality, antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive aquaculture worldwide.
   P. salmonis infections are the cause of major bacterial disease in salmonids in Chile, and the reason for using more antibiotics compared to other salmon-producing countries. Vaccination and antibiotics have not been efficient and new approaches are needed. The safety of Quillaja saponaria extracts was measured by cytotoxicity using flow cytometry of cytopathic and death of fish cell cultures and efficacy was assessed using in vitro infection models with pathogenic P. salmonis. Cytotoxicity was low and control of in vitro infections was achieved with all products, with protection of over 90%. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were much higher than those in the infection using cell cultures. These results suggest a dual mechanism of action where less purified extracts with a combination of saponin and non-saponin components simultaneously decrease P. salmonis infection while protecting cell lines, rather than exerting a direct antimicrobial effect. Quillaja saponins controlled in vitro infections with P. salmonis and could be considered good candidates for a new, safe and sustainable method of controlling fish bacterial infectious diseases.

AB  - The paper contributes to the scarce empirical knowledge concerning the effects of improving public transport services on patronage. It analyses cases in eight Norwegian cities, varying in size from 12,000 to 118,000 inhabitants, where bus services were reorganised into fewer, straighter, faster and simpler lines with higher frequencies. Walking distances to stops increased in some areas and services were reduced on less used routes. The interventions were followed by patronage growth of 3.3-17.6% per year over the evaluation period, contrasting the pre-change situation of lower growth or decline. Stronger focus on increasing public transport competitiveness versus cars, enhanced knowledge among planners and organisational changes leaving more power to the professionals stood out as important factors explaining why these interventions had been implemented. The results might be relevant for those involved in developing bus-based, regular, local public transport services for largely self-sustained small and medium-sized cities aiming at increasing patronage.

AB  - The selection of an appropriate forest management program is an arduous task in which opinions and information are shared. In this research, we have tried to facilitate this process by applying the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) method in order to discriminate among the various management alternatives and to identify the management preferences stated by a group of key actors in decision making process: common property forest owners. Descriptive results from the BWS method show the ranking for preventive wildfire policies from the best (most preferred) to the worst (least preferred) policy among those evaluated by forest owners. However, and after employing a Latent Class Model, we find that common forest owners can be classified into two different classes, especially distant in terms of preferences toward forest management priorities. On one hand, one of the classes (containing older individuals) is more likely to prefer policies based on direct economic incentives and quicker returns, whereas a second class (younger) prefers other policies that also contain environmental and social spillovers or benefits. Thus, we find that BWS may be a very suitable method of elicitation of preferences in the context of decision making under multiple conflicting criteria.

AB  - The present paper analyses how top managers construct the meaning of sustainable human resource management (HRM) and its responsibility areas and how they identify and prioritize stakeholders in sustainable HRM. The empirical data were collected as part of the Finnish HR Barometer inquiry. A qualitative analysis reveals four dimensions of sustainable HRM: Justice and equality, transparent HR practices, profitability, and employee well-being. It also reveals four broader responsibility areas: Legal and ethical, managerial, social, and economic. Contrary to the prior green HRM literature, ecological responsibility was largely ignored. The study also reveals a wide range of stakeholders, specifically, owners, managers, employees, customers, and employee representatives, as well as their special roles and requirements for sustainable HRM. These findings contribute to the literature of sustainable HRM by illustrating the dimensions and broader responsibilities of sustainable HRM as seen by top managers. Their conceptions of sustainable HRM are largely neglected in the prior literature despite their crucial role in legitimating HRM and thus sustainable HRM in companies. These results also contribute to the theory of stakeholder salience (identification and prioritization of stakeholders) in the sustainable HRM context from the viewpoint of top managers.

AB  - At large scales, the mechanisms underpinning stability in natural communities may vary in importance due to changes in species composition, mean abundance, and species richness. Here we link species characteristics (niche positions) and community characteristics (richness and abundance) to evaluate the importance of stability mechanisms in 156 butterfly communities monitored across three European countries and spanning five bioclimatic regions. We construct niche-based hierarchical structural Bayesian models to explain first differences in abundance, population stability, and species richness between the countries, and then explore how these factors impact community stability both directly and indirectly (via synchrony and population stability). Species richness was partially explained by the position of a site relative to the niches of the species pool, and species near the centre of their niche had higher average population stability. The differences in mean abundance, population stability, and species richness then influenced how much variation in community stability they explained across the countries. We found, using variance partitioning, that community stability in Finnish communities was most influenced by community abundance, whereas this aspect was unimportant in Spain with species synchrony explaining most variation; the UK was somewhat intermediate with both factors explaining variation. Across all countries, the diversity-stability relationship was indirect with species richness reducing synchrony which increased community stability, with no direct effects of species richness. Our results suggest that in natural communities, biogeographical variation observed in key drivers of stability, such as population abundance and species richness, leads to community stability being limited by different factors and that this can partially be explained due to the niche characteristics of the European butterfly assemblage.

AB  - In this study, we examined knowledge and understanding of sport-related injuries among youth athletics (track and field) athletes and assessed their needs in managing any health problems. Qualitative data were collected via 12 focus groups with youth athletes (16-19 years) studying at Swedish sports high schools with an athletics specialism. All focus group discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed before being analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Four researchers independently reviewed the transcripts, generated codes and developed themes. Three overarching themes related to the athletes' knowledge and understanding of sport-related injury were developed: (1) awareness of injuries, (2) perception of injuries, and (3) factors contributing to injuries. The youth athletes were typically uncertain about how to acknowledge a sport-related injury. They expressed that knowledge about injuries was obtained in part by reflecting on the lived experiences of their peers. It was also demonstrated that there appears to be a 'culture of acceptance' regarding injury occurrence. In contrast, causes of injuries were viewed as dependent on multiple factors (eg, lack of context-specific knowledge about training practices). Regarding athletes' needs in managing injuries, an additional three themes were developed: (1) creating functioning elite sports environments, (2) application of knowledge and (3) fostering athletes. An apparent lack of structure and organisation related to the school environment was identified as an important issue to review to create opportunities for sustainable athletic development. The study identified areas that can be improved in Swedish sports high schools with an athletic specialism and could be applied in other youth sports contexts. The results of this study guide school stakeholders, alongside the sport governing bodies who have the mandate to influence activities in youth sports contexts, whereby special attention should be directed towards improving the social environment for youth athletes.

AB  - The 2015 Paris Agreement encourages stakeholders to implement sustainable forest management policies to mitigate anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The net effects of forest management on the climate and the environment are, however, still not completely understood, partially as a result of a lack of long-term measurements of GHG fluxes in managed forests. During the period 2010-2013, we simultaneously measured carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes using the flux-gradient technique at two clear-cut plots of different degrees of wetness, located in central Sweden. The measurements started approx. one year after clear-cutting, directly following soil scarification and planting. The study focused on robust inter-plot comparisons, spatial and temporal dynamics of GHG fluxes, and the determination of the global warming potential of a clear-cut boreal forest. The clear-cutting resulted in significant emissions of GHGs at both the wet and the dry plot. The degree of wetness determined, directly or indirectly, the relative contribution of each GHG to the total budgets. Faster establishment of vegetation on the wet plot reduced total emissions of CO2 as compared to the dry plot but this was partially offset by higher CH4 emissions. Waterlogging following clear-cutting likely caused both plots to switch from sinks to sources of CH4. In addition, there were periods with N2O uptake at the wet plot, although both plots were net sources of N2O on an annual basis. We observed clear diel patters in CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes during the growing season at both plots, with the exception of CH4 at the dry plot. The total three-year carbon budgets were 4107 gCO(2)-equivalent m(-2) and 5274 gCO(2)-equivalent m(-2) at the wet and the dry plots, respectively. CO2 contributed 91.8% to the total carbon budget at the wet plot and 98.2% at the dry plot. For the only full year with N2O measurements, the total GHG budgets were 1069.9 gCO(2)-eqvivalents m(-2) and 1695.7 gCO(2)-eqvivalents m(-2) at the wet and dry plot, respectively. At the wet plot, CH4 contributed 3.7%, while N2O contributed 7.3%. At the dry plot, CH4 and N2O contributed 1.5% and 7.6%, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the effects of the three GHGs on the climate for any forest management policy aiming at enhancing the mitigation potential of forests.

AB  - As part of ship acquisition decision making, owners and key stakeholders need to evaluate ship design and technology solutions across economic and environmental criteria in addition to safety and other regulatory requirements. Changes in technology, market, fiscal and other regulatory conditions may furthermore significantly influence value retention over the investment period. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides structure and clarity in otherwise complex decision problems, allowing decision makers to identify promising courses of action in a holistic manner. Combined with stochastic evaluation techniques, MCDM may facilitate problem exploration and learning in situations where outcomes are uncertain. In this article, we combine two variants of "Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis" (SMAA) with "Technique for Ordering of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution" (TOPSIS) to evaluate the use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity on Norwegian ferry crossings. We analyze uncertain criteria values for environmental impacts, costs, fuel access and public acceptance across seven ferry combinations for a crossing. Criteria weighting is performed deterministically and stochastically to extract and interpret the conditions under which alternatives perform well or poorly. The case study shows that all-electric propulsion is preferable, while plug-in hybrid solutions with natural gas also give a robust performance. The approach is beneficial in handling multiple, uncertain performance metrics and provides a transparent and holistic foundation for evaluating marine emission reduction technology options in ship acquisition decision contexts.

AB  - Some of the most economically valued soils for agricultural use are naturally occurring sulfide rich sediments. However, formation of acid sulfate soils with sulfuric materials (pH <= 4) can occur when sulfidic materials are exposed to air, which can then result in mobilisation of large amounts of acid and metals into nearby water bodies. In this study, controlled drainage, subsurface irrigation and hydrochemical precision treatments are combined to reduce acidic discharges on a novel project field in western Finland. The PRECIKEM project field consists of nine identical hydrologically isolated 1 ha subfields. Each field had a drainage system consisting of three subsurface drainage pipes (c. 1.3m deep), a collector pipe, and a control well enabling manual ground-water table management. Utilising such drainage installations already common on farmlands, suspensions of fine-grained (d(50) = 2.5 mu m) calcium carbonate and/or calcium hydroxide were pumped in to control wells in order to be distributed in to subsoils with sulfuric materials via drainage networks with the aim to: (1) neutralise acidity, (2) inhibit microbially mediated sulfide oxidation and (3) immobilise metals. The discharge waters from the fields were monitored during the project period 2012-2016. As is typical for acid sulfate soils with sulfuric materials, the discharge waters from the reference fields (n = 3) that had been treated with water only, had very low pH values (<= 4) and the acidity and concentrations of several metals were up to two magnitudes higher than the average in Finnish stream waters. Excavation of selected treated fields revealed the calcium carbonate to have formed a neutralising coating on the surfaces of hydrologically active macropores in the soil matrix near the subsurface drainage pipes. This effectively resulted in a long-term (1-4 years) situation of raised pH, lower acidity and lower concentrations of several acid sensitive metals, most prominently a significant decrease (> 90%) in Al concentrations. Fe concentrations in discharge waters were subsequently decreased as the predominance of Fe shifted toward the schwertmannite and iron oxides stability phases due to changes in pH/redox conditions. The methods presented in this work showed favourable steps toward environmentally sustainable agriculture and improving the chemical and ecological status of acid sulfate soil affected coastal waters.

AB  - The practices of organizational talent acquisition are rapidly transforming as a result of the proliferation of information systems that support decision-making, ranging from applicant tracking systems to recruitment chatbots. As part of human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition covers recruitment and team-assembly activities and is allegedly in dire need for digital aid. We analyze the pitfalls and tensions of digitalization in this area through a lens that builds on the interdisciplinary literature related to digital ethics. Using three relevant landmark papers, we analyzed qualitative data from 47 interviews of HRM professionals in Finland, including team-assembly facilitators and recruitment experts. The analysis highlights 14 potential tensions and pitfalls, such as the tension between requesting detailed data versus respecting privacy and the pitfall of unequal treatment across application channels. We identify that the values of autonomy, fairness and utility are often especially at risk of being compromised. We discuss the tendency of the binary considerations related to human and automated decision making, and the reasons for the incompatibility between current digital systems and organizations' needs for talent acquisition.

AB  - Natural temporal variation in biological assemblages is generally acknowledged, but rarely controlled for in existing bioassessment approaches. Many bioassessment methods ignore the variation of assemblage structure through time and, thus, lack a process to evaluate the effects of natural temporal variation on their outcomes. We used an 11-y data set from 24 near-pristine reference streams (validation sites) and a 5-y data set from 10 streams exposed to human disturbance (test sites) in northern Finland to examine: 1) the amount of interannual variation in macroinvertebrate communities in both types of streams measured as variation in taxonomic completeness (i.e., ratio of observed/expected taxa; O/E ratio), and 2) how temporal variability affects bioassessment outcomes. Most of the variation in O/E values was explained by stream type (validation or test). Interannual variation in O/E was low at both validation and test sites, a result supporting the assumption of high constancy of biological assemblages through time. Temporal variation in O/E at validation sites was related to climatic factors (regional precipitation) and to some local environmental variables, e. g., substratum heterogeneity. Communities in validation and test sites responded differentially to climatic variation. The low interannual variation in O/E suggests that 1-y data from reference sites can be extrapolated across years relatively safely, but climatically extreme years may be problematic. Temporal variability in O/E was low at both types of sites, but it was still high enough to result in variable ecological status assessments across years, mainly at test sites with lower O/E ratios. Thus, at test sites, use of only 1-y data may cause erroneous management decisions, and accurate assessment of the biological quality of test sites might require repeated sampling over several years.

AB  - Implementing electromobility is a central component in the de-carbonization of personal mobility. In recent years, the absolute number of electric vehicles (EVs) and their market share has increased sharply in many countries. This paper focuses on Norway, a pioneer market for EVs that other countries can learn from. The analysis highlights how a combination of local and national policies over a 30-y period, which targeted both industry development and vehicle demand, were important drivers of this development. It also highlights the importance of advocacy groups and strong networks in promoting EVs, as well as changes in user preferences. The paper demonstrates how the EV diffusion has been driven by alignments of multiple processes across different levels, involving interactions between multiple actors and social groups with different interests and views about desirable futures as described by the multi-level perspective (MLP). Building on the MLP, the study of EV diffusion in Norway illustrates how niches are often sustained through demonstrations, experimentation, strategic alliances, and actors securing favorable political and economic conditions. Further, it shows how local or national niches may depend on international regime actors, such as the car manufacturing industry and policies developed abroad. The paper also explores how the introduction of EVs has opened for wider effects, including innovation within production-consumption systems beyond mobility. Based on this analysis, we argue for a nuanced perspective on the relationship between incremental, regime-internal innovation, and wider transformative changes, where the merits of societal learning and experience with battery electricity for transportation are highlighted.

AB  - Urbanization is negatively affecting biodiversity worldwide, and general ecological patterns may also differ between urban and more natural areas. The main aim of this study was to examine if urbanization has effects on the wintering species occupancy frequency distribution (SOFD) and species abundance-occupancy relationship (SAOR), and if the observed patterns varied between winters, different sizes of towns, and regionally in Finland. In this study, temporal variation of the SOFD and SAOR patterns was studied in 29 town and village centers along a 950-km (60-68 degrees N) latitudinal gradient during mid-winters in Finland. Wintering birds were counted during three winters (1991-1992, 1999-2000, and 2009-2010) from the same study sites and with the same survey methods. A total of 35 wintering bird species and 13,285 individuals were detected. The bimodal symmetric SOFD pattern explained best the distribution of species in the pooled data, and the observed pattern was constant between the study winters, different sizes of towns, and towns located in southern and northern Finland. Three species (Parus major, Pica pica, and Passer domesticus) were core species during all winters, irrespective of the size of town or latitude. There was a slightly higher number of species belonging in satellite species group in the southern than in the northern towns. No changes of species from the core to satellite species were detected, and vice versa. However, the occupancy rate of some species belonging to the intermediate species group either moved toward satellite species or core species across winters. The SAOR pattern was positive and stable over study winters and did not differ between different sizes of towns or town location. Our results indicated that urbanization leads a structure of winter bird community, where there are few widely distributed sedentary core species and many partially migratory or migratory satellite species with a restricted distribution. Our results also demonstrated that urbanization stabilizes between-winter community structure, probably because of intensive winter feeding activities. Our results give support to the metapopulation model, which predicts a bimodal SOFD pattern.

AB  - In this paper, a non linear finite element analysis of a full scale reinforced concrete bridge tested in O-vik (Sweden) is presented. In order to quantify the carrying capacity of the bridge, an ultimate load test combining bending and shearing load effects was performed within the European Union founded project "Sustainable Bridges - Assessment for Future Traffic Demands and Longer Lives". The numerical analysis has two objectives. The first one consists in evaluating the ability of new constitutive mechanical models compared to experimental data measured. The second one, more qualitative, aims at quantifying the influence of local degradations on the global mechanical response of the bridge. To achieve this objective, a new steel/concrete interface constitutive model has been used for including the presence of corrosion. This paper shows that the proposed constitutive models can be very valuable for modelling complex existing reinforced concrete structures.

AB  - Fertilising with phosphorus (P) ensures continuous supply of an essential growth factor as necessary for productive and sustainable agriculture. The amounts of P required to attain and maintain an adequate P status in the soil were investigated in field experiments at 22 sites in Finland on soils containing large amounts of residual fertiliser P. The effects of five rates (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 kg ha(-1)) of annual P application were measured in the soil by chemical methods after 9 to 15 experimental years, and the changes in soil test P values (STP) were compared with P balances. Stratification of P in ley soil by broadcast application of fertilisers was assessed at four sites. The mean changes of STP in the whole topsoil caused by P fertilisation expressed as per cent of the balance difference were 3.5% (0.0159 mg dm(-3))/(kg ha(-1)) in the acid ammonium acetate test (P-Ac) 4.7% (0.0214 mg dm(-3))/(kg ha(-1)) in water extraction (P-w) and 9.7% (0.058 mg kg(-1))/(kg ha(-1)) in sodium bicarbonate extraction (modified Olsen P). Initially high P-Ac values tended to slowly decrease at zero P balance, while low values did not change without some particular reason, such as soil acidification or mixing of the topsoil with some of the less fertile subsurface soil. A thin layer of the uppermost soil was quickly enriched by broadcast application of P fertiliser.

AB  - Close correlations in species numbers may make it possible to indirectly assess the species richness of difficult taxonomic groups by investigating indicator groups, for which data are more easily collected. We asked if species numbers correlate among the four dominating groups of primary producers in boreal forests (liverworts, macrolichens, mosses, and vascular plants) and if substrate affiliation of species (ground vs. other substrates), sample plot size (0.01-1000 m(2)), and stand age (young vs. old) influence correlation strength. We used three sets of study plots from northern Sweden each including wide ranges of species richness. Although there are large differences in the ecophysiology and substrate use of vascular plants and the two bryophyte groups (mosses and liverworts), we found strong positive correlations among them not previously reported from boreal forests. In contrast, no correlation in total species richness was found between macrolichens and the two bryophyte groups, despite large overlaps in their ecology. We suggest that the positive correlations among land plants (liverworts, mosses, and vascular plants) are linked to positive relationships between site moisture and species number for all three groups. In contrast, total species number of macrolichens has not been shown to be strongly associated with moisture. However, ground-living lichens and mosses correlated negatively in old forests. This may relate to the inability of macrolichens to exploit shaded and wet old forest ground, a habitat that is used by many moss species. Furthermore, lichens and mosses of 'other substrates' correlated positively in old forests, probably because the amount of boulders was positively related to species richness in both groups. Generally, correlations became stronger with increasing plot size, whereas stand age had relatively little influence. We conclude that vascular plants could be used as an indicator group for species richness of mosses and liverworts in boreal landscapes.

AB  - Although consumers express environmental attitudes, the pro-environmental behaviors are not dominant. Despite the benefits of sustainable technologies in reducing the environmental impacts of consumption, consumer adoption of these technologies is very slow to take off. We propose an integrated approach for investigating the effect of consumer anticipated emotions and moral norms on consumer adoption of a sustainable technology (electric vehicles). 576 Swedish car drivers participated in an online survey during winter of 2013. Our findings suggest that anticipated emotions directly influence consumer adoption intentions and the effect of moral norms on behavioral intentions is mediated by the anticipated emotions. The findings have implications for policymakers and car producers in promoting the zero emission transportation. We suggest communicating the positive emotions related to driving an electric vehicle and use of emotions in cars' energy labelling.

AB  - The article examines the challenges university teachers face when adopting connective pedagogy in organizing teaching. Instead of studying the learning outcomes of the method, we decided in this research to focus on the teachers' experiences when doing things differently in a fairly traditional pedagogical institution like a university. In spring 2019, as a part of our new degree programme entitled Culture, Communities, and Change (KUMU) at the University of Jyvaskyla, we implemented a multisensory ethnography course in collaboration with a third sector development project promoting village tourism in Central Finland. On the course, we applied a problem-based approach to implement the connective pedagogy through which we wanted to increase the students' working life skills and public engagement. While the main objective of the multisensory ethnography course was to develop village tourism and teach the students how to do ethnographic research, we also scrutinized our own teaching experience in developing higher education pedagogy through documenting our own activities in field diaries and analysing our own roles through self-reflexive ethnographic practice. The group discussions and the diaries of the teachers during the course are the data that has been analysed by means of social practice theory. The three elements of social practices-material, competence, and meaning-helped us to identify the important factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to change everyday practices in our work, in this case to organize collaborative teaching with a third sector development project. According to our results, a problem-based approach is an effective tool on a collaborative project course between the university and a third sector organization because it enabled us to practice connective pedagogy at a very practical level. There are also challenges in applying a new method. Studying our diaries and notes of group discussions and reflecting our experiences, we identified the following critical stages and weak spots: Planning and co-ordinating the course took a lot of time and resources and teachers must tolerate a certain amount of uncertainty. The competence of the teachers was also challenged; they needed to be open, for example, to dealing with unfamiliar research topics. Even if the teachers' meanings, motivation, and values were in accordance with the principles of connective pedagogy, there are still many contradictions in the meaning element of problem-based teaching practice. Above all, the teachers were compelled to question their role as experts when taking third sector actors as equal partners in producing new knowledge.

AB  - This article discusses sustainability in Human Resource Management (HRM) in the blurred digital working life, focusing on the emotion of stress. Its empirical basis is an activity and emotion diary study conducted with 26 employees of three industrial companies in Sweden. Our results show that work and private life are integrated by digital activities and also by emotions. Due to the extensive use of digital devices, stress in the working sphere is not only connected with work, and stress in the private sphere is not only connected with private life. The study also shows that stress is often episodic and can end due to activities connected with both the trigger and non-trigger spheres. From a social sustainability perspective, this study suggests that HRM should gently extend employee consideration beyond the traditional temporal and spatial boundaries of work, i.e., also including private life when understanding work in the digital age.

AB  - Studies on quantitative soil contamination due to heavy metals were carried out in Katedan Industrial Development Area (KIDA), south of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India under the Indo-Norwegian Institutional Cooperation Programme. The study area falls under a semi-arid type of climate and consists of granites and pegmatite of igneous origin belonging to the Archaean age. There are about 300 industries dealing with dyeing, edible oil production, battery manufacturing, metal plating, chemicals, etc. Most of the industries discharge their untreated effluents either on open land or into ditches. Solid waste from industries is randomly dumped along roads and open grounds. Soil samples were collected throughout the industrial area and from downstream residential areas and were analysed by X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer for fourteen trace metals and ten major oxides. The analytical data shows very high concentrations of lead, chromium, nickel, zinc, arsenic and cadmium through out the industrial area. The random dumping of hazardous waste in the industrial area could be the main cause of the soil contamination spreading by rainwater and wind. In the residential areas the local dumping is expected to be the main source as it is difficult to foresee that rain and wind can transport the contaminants from the industrial area. If emission to air by the smokestacks is significant, this may contribute to considerable spreading of contaminants like As, Cd and Pb throughout the area. A comparison of the results with the Canadian Soil Quality Guidelines (SQGL) show that most of the industrial area is heavily contaminated by As, Pb and Zn and local areas by Cr, Cu and Ni. The residential area is also contaminated by As and some small areas by Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. The Cd contamination is detected over large area but it is not exceeding the SQGL value. Natural background values of As and Cr exceed the SQGL values and contribute significantly to the contamination in the residential area. However, the availability is considerably less than anthropogenic contaminants and must therefore be assessed differently. The pre- and post-monsoon sampling over two hydrological cycles in 2002 and 2003 indicate that the As, Cd and Pb contaminants are more mobile and may expect to reach the groundwater. The other contaminants seem to be much more stable. The contamination is especially serious in the industrial area as it is housing a large permanent residing population. The study not only aims at determining the natural background levels of trace elements as a guide for future pollution monitoring but also focuses on the pollution vulnerability of the watershed. A plan of action for remediation is recommended.

AB  - Background: Efficient and sustainable plant protection is of great economic and ecological significance for global crop production. A number of challenges, e.g. climate change, population growth and global trade, put increasing demands on future crop production and crop protection. This necessitates an increase in crop productivity with less environmental impact while maintaining good food quality and food security. To meet these challenges, it is essential that the recommendations provided to growers are efficient and correct, which can only be ensured by evidence-based recommendations based on outcomes from scientific studies.
   Methods and output: The aim of these systematic maps is to compile scientific evidence for different plant disease protection strategies for the main arable crops grown in Sweden. Six major crops (wheat, barley, oat, potato, sugar beet and oilseed rape) have been selected based on the area under production, the annual production, the economic importance, and the amount of pesticide used against diseases in these crops in Sweden. All methods to manage diseases will be considered, including cropping system, pesticide application, biological control methods, as well as combinations of methods and integrated pest management. These systematic maps will only deal with field studies of relevance for agricultural practices in Sweden, although we expect that the results will be applicable for northern Europe as a whole. The main outcome to be used will be productivity measured as yield per area. Plant health and pathogen reduction will be included as a proxy for potential increase in crop quality and yield. This will provide a systematic overview of the plant disease protection measures that have been reported in the scientific literature. The study will result in one searchable database per crop that may be used as a catalogue of evidence for researchers and stakeholders, especially authorities and advisory organizations. The systematic maps will aid in the identification of areas that need further research and guide funding agencies and policymakers when deciding where research resources should be allocated. It will also help to select topics for future systematic reviews and meta-studies within the field of plant protection.

AB  - This article examines sustainable development discourses while addressing the unsustainable structures within which these discourses take place. The main research question concerns how sustainability is understood in relation to class and capitalism and what ideologies are expressed as neutral in the anodyne context of public information. Critical discourse analysis is applied as a method to examine how sustainable development is shaped through the construction of problems, responsibilities and solutions in a Swedish municipal magazine. The analysis reveals two parallel constructions: hyper-politicised discourses about free enterprise and a trivialisation of discourses about socio-economic challenges. Texts about social care and social responsibility are represented in the form of banal politics, transforming conflict into consensus, while stories about the business sector rely heavily on market rationales stressing the importance of political intervention to increase the attractive power of entrepreneurialism. Taking Critical Theory as its starting point, the analysis discusses the neoliberal paradox, namely that in the neoliberal political regime, despite the rhetoric of individualism and freedom, the role of the state is to support private enterprises. The article argues that the role of communication needs further analytical attention to increase our understanding of how sustainability is shaped and established in mainstream public discourse. It concludes that the specific communication practice examined here promotes neoliberal capitalism by encouraging the continued unsustainable class structuring of our society.

AB  - Rural areas are less attractive and sustainable for people and businesses alike, partially due to inadequate transport services. In this paper, we address transport-related challenges in rural Norway. The focal aspect of our approach is to define a set of values for the design and mechanisms of transitioning towards more sustainable rural transport making a real-life difference for people living in rural areas. We connect UN sustainability goals and transition design to discuss how these can be operationalized and used throughout the design process seeking to innovate rural transport. Reflecting on how to find the initial `leverage points' to scaffold the transition to more sustainable transport systems, we explore the possibility of introducing relevant Key Performance Indicators early on in the design process. We report on our experiences and findings regarding the use Key Performance Indicators in different phases of a design-led innovation process.

AB  - Objectives. - This article deals about an aspect not taken into consideration often when considering violent sexual offenses. The term "crime scene", which got widespread into common language, depicts all the elements collected at the place where a crime occurred and which could later become pieces of evidence. However, the place by itself, the link between the offender and the place, the influence of the urban environment and the cultural aspect of it do not receive that much attention in the literature. This paper originates from a comparison of the work of two psychologists specialized within the field of geoprofiling, D. Canter and K. Rossmo, the latter being a Canadian citizen and the former an Englishman. If their postulates were similar, their findings however diverged. If primary caretakers and early interactions are not to be underestimated regarding their roles into the personality development, we will in these pages consider the urban environment by itself in serial sexual offenses.
   Methods. - Due to a restricted access to this type of patients, we mainly focused our hypothesis on a literature review and a few patients of ours, met during previous research works. Concepts used in this paper overlap various fields such as psychodynamic, criminology, criminalistics, psycho-sociology and even urbanism. We focused in this paper onto the importance of the culture and the urban concrete environment as probable variables explaining these discrepancies observed into the behavioral patterns and distances covered by Serial Sex Offenders between the two shores of the Atlantic. The underlying question being how their space conception, their "mental maps", depends of the culture they were bred in and how it could have an incident onto their offense zones?
   Results. - The findings highlight an inherently cultural variation of the spatial conception, but also how the space is built up and integrated between the USA (and all the large and historically "recents" territories) and Europe. American sexual serial offenders are more likely to cover larger distances, almost twice as much than their European counterparts. It seems that our hypothesis is relevant; a cultural distinction may exist on the way spatial environment is perceived and could thus have incidences into the offense patterns.
   Conclusions. - With the development of the E.U., our spatial conceptions as European citizens evolve. Thanks to mass transportation, and the Erasmus programs, it is not uncommon for an Italian individual to study in Scotland or Finland for instance. This is of some importance into how the spatial mobility is becoming more thinkable, and somehow how it induces a shrinkage of the distance into the mental mapping process.

AB  - Researchers struggle to create simple yet nuanced diagrams or short abstracts that are easily comprehendible by non-experts. Research articles may be our primary communication method, but they are generally difficult to understand, making them unsuitable for general communication.This paper investigates a rarely used method in transport research - vignettes - to convey research results and elicit implications for public planners. Historically, these vignettes have been designed using qualitative methods, e.g., the Delphi method or by researchers' review of trends. However, this paper uses two vignettes originating from quantitative results from a simulation model paper (Almlo center dot f et al., 2022), investigating the impacts of self-driving technology. Rewriting the results into two short stories - vignettes - these stories then served as the starting point for semi-structured interviews and a workshop with six public officials in Stockholm, Sweden. The vignettes were used to understand what these results would mean to the participants and how they would combat potential problems connected to sustainability, given the vignettes. Finally, the interviews and the workshop were qualitatively analysed, and policy tools were identified that can steer the transport system towards societal goals.The vignettes were a powerful tool to help the participants envision a future with self-driving transport options and promote critical thinking regarding how each participant would be affected, given such a future. As such, vignettes should be further explored to help researchers investigate abstract subjects which participants may have difficulties understanding.

AB  - Despite ongoing changes in housing construction around parking requirements, few studies have been undertaken on travel practice and vehicle ownership once homes have been built in line with new requirements and occupied. This study focused on the experience and travel practices of residents in two specific cases involving new requirements in Sweden. It was based on interviews and questionnaires with residents before and after they moved into the two new blocks of apartments. A relatively restricted supply of parking was compensated for with subsidized mobility services for the residents, e.g., car and bike (sharing) clubs. The results indicated a decrease in car ownership in both blocks, as well as a decrease in the frequency of car travel in one of them. There were indications that use of public transport had increased. Our analysis illustrates the roles that parking and mobility services played over time in establishing the residents' travel habits. The process that shaped the new residents' car ownership and travel patterns was, in part, quite slow and unspectacular compared with the intentions and expectations of the stakeholders involved as regards to how car ownership and travel habits would change. We discuss a spectrum of everyday life conditions, which together with parking requirements and mobility services can stimulate the growth of urban mobility practices other than those based on private car ownership.

AB  - Transdisciplinarity is often presented as a way to effectively use scientific research to contribute to societal problem solving for sustainability. The aim of this paper is to critically explore this statement. This is done in two ways. First, a literature survey of transdisciplinary research is used to identify the assumptions that underlie the positive relationship between transdisciplinarity and societal problem solving for sustainability. This mapping identifies the claim that in-depth participation of users and the integration of relevant knowledge from both practice and research in real-world problem contexts produce socially robust results that contribute to sustainability. Second, the ability to live up to this claim is presented and discussed in five case study projects from Mistra Urban Futures, a transdisciplinary center in Goteborg, Sweden. The conclusions show that transdisciplinary processes, which fulfill the above conditions, do produce different types of socially robust knowledge, but this does not necessarily result in the ability to influence change in a sustainable direction. This instead creates a paradox in that the participation of stakeholders and the integration of knowledge from diverse sources require spaces that are both embedded in and insulated from practice and science proper. Such spaces produce results that are not easily aligned with sector-based target groups and formal policy processes. Institutionalizing transdisciplinarity in a boundary organization therefore solves some problems regarding participation and balanced problem ownership. However, it also creates new, hybrid problems, regarding knowledge transfer and scalability, which bridge the boundaries and challenge the praxis of planning and policy making.

AB  - Recent developments in pollen modelling and landscape reconstruction have the potential to have a profound impact on our understanding of landscape change related to human activity. Initial findings have already revealed the weaknesses of a number of key assumptions previously made about pollen-landscape relationships. Close interrelationships exist between landscape reconstruction based on pollen analysis and archaeology, and model-based developments raise a range of pertinent issues for both disciplines. These include the way in which past vegetation patterning is conceptualised (the patch vs. the matrix), the nature of the underlying physical environment in vegetation placement, the development of hypothesis-led approaches and the scale of landscapes under consideration. This paper discusses these issues, and also raises questions concerning the meaning of landscape. It may be erroneous to term pollen-based reconstructions as landscapes given the heavily charged meaning of the word as understood by companion and end user disciplines.

AB  - Inventories of land molluscs based on samples are liable to biased sampling error, because species that are present may be missed. Such errors may give a false impression of the degree of difference between faunas from similar sites, and they are confounded with genuine heterogeneity, which has considerable ecological and conservation significance. The statistical properties of such errors are examined briefly in the context of sample size and the frequency distribution of species, The effectiveness of different sampling strategies is assessed, taking account of [lie different life cycles and behaviour of various mollusc species. Taking random quadrats alone is not an efficient method for inventory, a combination of visual search and extraction from litter and soil is required. A set of practical guidelines is given, and the importance of good inventories, especially in oligotrophic habitats, is underlined.

AB  - In Sweden, the legume birdsfoot trefoil (BT) (Lotus corniculatus L.) is most frequently found along roadsides, especially in the drier regions in the South. However, some sheep farmers cultivate it for grazing. In recent years there has been an awakening of interest in BT as a forage crop. BT can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which is of special importance in organic farming. Even more important reasons to study it are that it is digested slowly in the rumen and that it may reduce the occurrence of internal parasites because of a high proportion of condensed tannins. Its drought tolerance, low fertility requirements and contribution to biodiversity also are interesting properties.
   The objective of this investigation was to study adaptation of BT to a cold-temperate climate when grown with different companion grasses and cut either two or four times per year. The experiment was financially supported by the local Rural Economy and Agricultural Society.

AB  - Understanding public risk perceptions and their underlying processes is important in order to learn more about the way people interpret and respond to hazardous emergency events. Direct experience with an involuntary hazard has been found to heighten the perceived risk of experiencing the same hazard and its consequences in the future, but it remains unclear if cross-over effects are possible (i.e., experience with one hazard influencing perceived risk for other hazards also). Furthermore, the impact of objective risk and country of residence on perceived risk is not well understood. As part of the BeSeCu (Behavior, Security, and Culture) Project, a sample of 1,045 survivors of emergencies from seven European countries (i.e., Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden, Spain, Turkey, and Italy) was drawn. Results revealed heightened perceived risk for emergency events (i.e., domestic and public fires, earthquakes, floods, and terrorist attacks) when the event had been experienced previously plus some evidence of cross-over effects, although these effects were not so strong. The largest country differences in perceived risk were observed for earthquakes, but this effect was significantly reduced by taking into account the objective earthquake risk. For fires, floods, terrorist attacks, and traffic accidents, only small country differences in perceived risk were found. Further studies including a larger number of countries are welcomed.

AB  - While the field of climate change communication has become increasingly interested in visual representations, there has been a lack of research that attempts to capture the breadth and variety of semiotic resources being drawn upon in the contemporary media landscape. In this paper, social semiotic theory is drawn upon for investigating how colour and sound may contribute to the social construction of risk in a sample of four professionally produced Norwegian educational videos, all of which are aimed at explaining the reality and danger of anthropogenic climate change. The results indicate that the colour schemes and soundscapes of the videos contribute meaning potentials with affective resonances apt for the social construction of risk, and that the videos construe the risk differently. The authors suggest that in two of the sampled videos, the uses of colour and sound are apt for attenuating the risk perceived by the viewer, while in two other videos they are used in a manner apt for amplifying the perceived risk. Implications of these results are discussed in light of previous research on multimodal climate communication.

AB  - Data center industry is growing rapidly due to the expanding internet traffic and the upcoming IoT revolution. Data centers consume vast amounts of energy globally and are also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. There is a need to improve energy efficiency and sustainability of data center operations. The energy consumed by data centers is mostly converted to heat and this study focuses on utilizing that waste heat according to the principles of circular economy in the context of Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The overall regional business potential of data center waste heat utilization is evaluated and the best options of utilizing waste heat in case data center are sought. The study found that the most viable option would be utilizing waste heat locally to heat facilities or in industrial processes. Another potential option is to connect data center into a district heating system where waste heat can be fed.

AB  - The role of fire within Pinus mire ecosystems is explored by focusing on a palaeoentomological investigation of the extensive burnt fossil forest preserved within the basal deposits of the raised mires of Thorne and Hatfield Moors, Humberhead Levels, eastern England. Remains of charred tree macrofossils (roots, stumps and trunks) are widely distributed across both sites, mainly comprising Pinus and Betula. Evidence from this research and elsewhere suggests fires were a common event on Pinus mires, and may indicate that such episodes played an important role in the development of raised bogs. A fire-loving (pyrophilous) insect fauna appears to have been attracted to the burnt areas, and the decline and extirpation in Britain of a number of pyrophilous species (e.g. Stagetus borealis Isrealsson) suggests the former importance of this type of habitat within British Pinus mire systems. The lack of consideration given to the role of natural fires within the British landscape is questioned, and the interpretation of charcoal within mire deposits as a possible anthropogenic indicator is highlighted as an area that would benefit from some reconsideration.

AB  - Understanding the genecology of forest trees is critical for gene conservation, for predicting the effects of climate change and climate change adaptation, and for successful reforestation. Although common genecological patterns have emerged, species-specific details are also important. Which species are most vulnerable to climate change? Which are the most important adaptive traits and environmental drivers of natural selection? Even though species have been classified as adaptive specialists vs. adaptive generalists, large-scale studies comparing different species in the same experiment are rare. We studied the genecology of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver fir (Abies alba), two co-occurring but ecologically distinct European conifers in Central Europe. For each species, we collected seed from more than 90 populations across Switzerland, established a seedling common-garden test, and developed genecological models that associate population variation in seedling growth and phenology to climate, soil properties, and site water balance. Population differentiation and associations between seedling traits and environmental variables were much stronger for Norway spruce than for silver fir, and stronger for seedling height growth than for bud phenology. In Norway spruce, height growth and second flushing were strongly associated with temperature and elevation, with seedlings from the lowlands being taller and more prone to second flush than seedlings from the Alps. In silver fir, height growth was more weakly associated with temperature and elevation, but also associated with water availability. Soil characteristics explained little population variation in both species. We conclude that Norway spruce has become an adaptive specialist because trade-offs between rapid juvenile growth and frost avoidance have subjected it to strong diversifying natural selection based on temperature. In contrast, because silver fir has a more conservative growth habit, it has evolved to become an adaptive generalist. This study demonstrates that co-occurring tree species can develop very different adaptive strategies under identical environmental conditions, and suggests that Norway spruce might be more vulnerable to future maladaptation due to rapid climate change than silver fir.

AB  - This article presents the results from an experimental project in Jyvaskyla, Finland, in which five 'pioneer households' aimed to reduce their environmental impacts by a variety of trials in different domains of daily consumption. The article analyses this 'home lab' experiment from a practice-theoretical perspective, focusing particularly on everyday mobility and the social interplay that occurs in mobility practices in different contexts. In so doing, the article explores the reasons behind the various outcomes of experimentation and discusses the potential of such experimentation to facilitate transformation in mobility practices. The results suggest that in order to shift daily mobility onto a more sustainable path, the social dynamics related to mobility practices should be better addressed. For example, the negotiations both inside and outside the participating households proved important in challenging the ways of doing mobility. Moreover, the potential for the diffusion of alternative mobility practices was shown to depend on a variety of factors that maintained the normality and acceptability of private driving. Utilising practice-theoretical insights in living laboratories can open new areas for experimentation and facilitate understanding of the shift in everyday practices towards greater sustainability.

AB  - Maps showing the distribution of seabed nature types, or habitats, are an important component of regional seabed mapping, such as in Norway's `MAREANO' programme. This is particularly the case when economic interests in the offshore area require information as a basis for sustainable development of resources. Generation of such maps represents the meeting of traditional disciplines of geology and biology, and is a process that requires multidisciplinary cooperation. Focussing on the eastern part of Tromsoflaket bank, and adjacent troughs in the southern Barents Sea, northern Norway we show how physical and biological data have been combined, with the help of multivariate statistics to produce a preliminary nature-type map for the area. This preliminary map represents an important first step in nature-type mapping in the offshore area and contributes to the national effort to define nature types and develop methods for their mapping and prediction.

AB  - Peatlands represent an important reservoir of carbon, but their functioning can be threatened by water level drawdown caused by climate or land use change. Knowledge of how microbial communities respond to long-term drainage in different peatland types could help improve predictions of the effect of climate change on these ecosystems. We investigated the effect of long-term drainage on microbial community composition in bog, fen and spruce swamp forests (SSF) in the Sumava Mountains (Czech Republic), using high-throughput barcoded sequencing, in relation to peat biochemical properties. Longterm drainage had substantial effects, which depended strongly on peatland type, on peat biochemical properties and microbial community composition. The effect of drainage was most apparent on fen, followed by SSF, and lowest on bog. Long-term drainage led to lower pH, reduced peat decomposability and increased bulk density, which was reflected by reduced microbial activity. Bacterial diversity decreased and Acidobacteria became the dominant phylum on drained sites, reflecting a convergence in bacterial community composition across peatlands after long-term drainage. The archaeal communities changed very strongly and became similar across drained peatlands. Overall, the characteristic differences between distinct peatland types under natural conditions were diminished by long-term drainage. Bog represented a relatively resilient system while fen seemed to be very sensitive to environmental changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cold-water corals are habitat-forming species that are also classified as indicators of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) due to the threat of various anthropogenic impacts, e.g., fisheries and oil/mineral exploration. To best protect VMEs, knowledge of their habitat requirements and distribution is essential. However, comprehensive sampling of the deep sea is difficult due to access and cost constraints, so species distribution modeling (SDM) is often used to predict overall distributions and ecological preferences of species based on limited data. We used Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modeling to predict the probability of presence of the reef-building scleractinian Lophelia pertusa and the octocorals Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis using a total of 2149 coral presence points and 15 environmental predictor variables. The environmental variables used in the analysis were processed to 176 m resolution and included bathymetry, depth, geomorphometric characteristics [slope, aspect, and bathymetric position index (BPI)], oceanography (temperature, salinity, current directions, and speed), surface chlorophyll a concentration, sediment type, and marine landscape type. Comparing presence points with environmental data showed that the temperature and depth range for Lophelia was narrower compared to the gorgonians, and it occurred in shallower, warmer water. Observations showed that Lophelia had a broad, bimodal response to Broad BPI, while the predicted model indicated a more narrow response. Paragorgia tolerated the greatest range of sloping according to the model. All three species were observed with a bimodal pattern along a wide range of mean current speed, while the models indicated a high response to faster current speed. Jackknife tests showed that sediment type was an important predictor for gorgonian corals, while BPI and minimum temperature were more important for Lophelia. The spatial precision of the models could be further increased by applying environmental layers with a higher and uniform spatial resolution. The predicted distribution of corals and their relation to environmental variables provides an important background for prioritizing areas for detailed mapping surveys and will aid in the conservation efforts for these VMEs in Norwegian waters and beyond.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic fully exposed the vulnerability of the global agri-food system to shocks and stresses, highlighting the need for transformation and action to make it more resilient and inclusive. This paper offers a unique insight into the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining impacts and responses in the agri-food sector within three very distinct contexts, namely the United States, Norway, and China. Focusing on small, diversified farms, the study builds on prior research with the same farmers and support organizations from an on-going collaboration. Firstly, we conducted a short review of policy adaptations to understand how governments, the private sector, non-profit organizations, and communities "stepped up" to provide emergency relief, specialized training, and recovery support for farmers, support that was instrumental in preventing more devastating impacts in all three countries. Secondly, drawing from in-depth interviews with farmers (23) and government and non-governmental support organizations (19), we mapped the vulnerability and resiliency of selected farmers to shocks that severely disrupted traditional supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected on both the negative and positive impacts of the pandemic to farmer inputs, including labor, operations, and markets, how these changed from the initial lockdowns in early 2020 and through 2021, and on farmer adaptive responses to these impacts. In some contexts, innovation and adaptive responses counteracted negative impacts. We saw diversifying markets, catering to consumer safety concerns, switching to direct and e-markets, hiring in more labor or relying on family labor, and switching to high demand crops and products as the most prominent adaptive responses. Farmers who lacked access to information and government programs, in large part because of language, technology and institutional barriers, missed out on pandemic related opportunities and suffered the most. As we enter the post-pandemic new normal it is important to take stock of lessons learned, and to continue to support those initiatives and innovations that were pivotal not only for weathering the storm, but for building a more inclusive and resilient agri-food system in the long-run.

AB  - Marine archaeological surveying in deep waters has so far been challenging, mainly due to operational and technological constraints. The standard tool has been Side Scan Sonar (SSS) towed behind a surface vessel. Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology is not subject to the traditional range/resolution tradeoff, and produces results of considerably higher quality than traditional SSS. In 2015 and 2016 a comprehensive mapping of wrecks in Skagerrak, a large deepwater area off the south coast of Norway was undertaken, using an interferometric SAS system deployed on an autonomous underwater vehicle. By examining data from two passes of one of the many historical wrecks that were detected in the survey area, we demonstrate how SAS can be used to produce very high resolution imagery and bathymetry of wreck sites. Furthermore, post processing techniques are applied to exploit the high information content inherent in SAS data, enhancing aspects of the data for relevant archaeological analysis and interpretation. We show in this paper how SAS technology represents significant improvements in our abilities to conduct high quality and high resolution seabed mapping. The adoption of this technology will both benefit archaeological research and provide knowledge for better decision making in underwater cultural heritage management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The wood - humidity interaction of solid wood has been tested through generations on Norwegian traditional panelling. This concept has been further explored by Michael Hensel and Steffen Reichert with Achim Menges on plywood and laminates in basic research. Plywood or laminates are better programmable but they are less sustainable due to the use of glue. This research focused on predicting the performance of solid wood in tangential section which is applied to humidity-temperature responsive screen for industrial production. With the method Systems Oriented Design, the research evaluated data from material science, forestry, meteorology, biology, chemistry and the production market. The method was introduced by Birger Sevaldson in 2007 with the argument that the changes in our globalized world and the need for sustainability demands an increase of the complexity of the design process. (Sevaldson 2013) Several samples has been tested for its environmental interaction. The data has been integrated in parametric models that tested the overall systems. Based on the simulations, the most suitable concept has been prototyped and measured for its performance. This lead to another sampling of the material whose data are the basis for another prototype. Ray 2 (figure 1) is an environmental responsive screen that is airing the structure in dry weather, while closing up when the humidity level is high, not allowing the moisture inside.

AB  - BackgroundChildhood is a critical period for promoting mental wellbeing and previous research suggests that various family-focused mental health promotion and early prevention initiatives are effective. The aim of the study was to explore Finnish health and social care practitioners' views and experiences of mental health promotion practice targeting families with young children.MethodsIndividual semi-structured interviews with 14 practitioners representing various municipal services, faith-based and third sector organizations were conducted in 2021 and analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsVarious challenges and opportunities for supporting mental health related to both structural features of the health and social care landscape and the varying needs of families were identified. The lack of resources as well as the social stigma associated with mental health problems and with public welfare services, hindered proactive work approaches and timely support. However, low-threshold initiatives and adapted information to families as well as further training about mental health for practitioners together with multi-professional collaboration and teamwork were suggested as potential enablers for mental health promotion.ConclusionsThe study highlights the importance of reaching families in a timely manner in order to promote mental wellbeing and prevent mental health problems. The findings, bringing to the fore the practitioners' own experiences and views, suggest how current practice could be developed in order to safeguard mental health and wellbeing for all families with young children. The practitioners' views and experiences are key components when building future sustainable and proactive health and social care services.

AB  - Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is a First Food of Native Americans. Declines in lamprey abundance due to dam construction and habitat loss have curtailed traditional harvest opportunities. Artificial propagation is an emerging recovery tool for this imperiled species, and other lamprey species in Finland and Japan. To manage disease risk at prospective lamprey hatcheries, it is critical to understand the pathogens and parasites most likely to affect lamprey and other fish, both in culture and in the wild. We assembled data from regional fish health laboratories to assess pathogen prevalence in Pacific lamprey sampled from various sources (518 adults, 275 larvae, and one juvenile). In adults, Aeromonas salmonicida was identified using standard health screening methods in 0-69% of dead lamprey samples submitted, but no other pathogens were typically observed. All larvae were negative for bacterial and viral infections, and larvae experimentally exposed to A. salmonicida showed no infection or mortality. Conspicuously absent were detailed health assessments for metamorphosed larvae (juveniles). However, external examinations of over 20,000 juveniles captured at dams on the lower Columbia River indicated that they are susceptible to fungal infection in warm water conditions (> 12 degrees C), which can lead to mortality. To fully evaluate the disease risk associated with lamprey culture, directed research is needed along with standardized health screenings of lamprey at all life stages. Control of A. salmonicida, the etiological agent for furunculosis, will be a top priority for Pacific lamprey use, as this was the only pathogen regularly identified in this species.

AB  - The present study focuses on dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities in shallow waters of northern coast of the Neva Estuary, Russia under eutrophication consequences such as proliferation of fast-growing filamentous algae Cladophora glomerata and oxygen depletion during the algae decomposition. Habitat characteristics (temperature, salinity, total phosphorus, and oxygen in water), taxonomical composition and abundance of zoobenthos were studied from May to October of 2003-2005. Temporary deoxygenation (0.6-2.8 mg cm(-3)) of water near bottom caused by the decomposition of detached C. glomerata was recorded annually from July to August. At the same periods, abundance of macroinvertebrates decreased significantly, from 23.6 to 3.6 (2003), 51.9 to 0.4 (2004) and 34.9 to 1.4 thousand ind.m(-2) (2005). The coastal eutrophication in the Neva Estuary causes the destabilizing fluctuations in benthic abundance that can facilitate the shifts in littoral community structure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is a strong connection between economic growth and development of cities. Economic growth tends to stimulate city growth, and city economies have often shaped innovative environments that in turn support economic growth. Simultaneously, social and environmental problems related to city growth can be serious threats to the realization of the socio-economic contributions that cities can make. However, as a result of considerable diversity of competences combined with interactive learning and innovation, cities may also solve these problems. The 'urban order' may form a platform for innovative problem solving and potential spill-over effects, which may stimulate further economic growth and development. This paper discusses how waste problems of cities can be transformed to become part of new, more sustainable solutions. Two cases are explored: Aalborg in Denmark and Malmo in Sweden. It is shown that the cities have the potential to significantly contribute to a more sustainable development through increased material recycling and energy recovery. Waste prevention may increase this potential. For example, instead of constituting 3% of the total greenhouse gas emission problem, it seems possible for modern European cities to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction by 15% through up to date technology and integrated waste management systems for material and energy recovery. Going from being part of the problem to providing solutions; however, is not an easy endeavour. It requires political will and leadership, supportive regulatory frameworks, realistic timetables/roadmaps, and a diverse set of stakeholders that can provide the right creative and innovative mix to make it possible.

AB  - The aims of this paper were to explore which factors explain (i) the direct emission of CO(2)from on-farm use of fuel to harvest forage and (ii) the costs of different harvesting management practices. Data on harvesting practices, CO(2)emission and forage costs were collected through farm visits on 184 dairy farms in all regions of Norway in 2017 and 2018. To analyze data, machine learning methods were used. The findings show that forage harvesting capacity and forage yield are associated with CO(2)emissions from on-farm use of diesel fuel and harvesting costs. Factors that mitigate CO(2)emissions from harvesting coincide with factors that contribute to reduced harvesting costs. Thus the findings suggest a 'win-to-win' relationship between the interests of the farming business and environmental sustainability. The findings have implications for dairy farmers and policy makers.

AB  - Ecological communities are composed of many species and an intricate network of interactions between them. Because of their overall complexity, an intriguing approach to understanding network structure is by breaking it down into the structural roles of its constituent species. The structural role of a species can be directly measured based on how it appears in network motifs - the basic building blocks of complex networks. Here, we study the distribution of species' roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e. species, network, and temporal) in host-parasitoid networks collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species' roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously distributed across the study system but that roles are strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found that species' roles were remarkably consistent between years even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover). Overall, our results suggest that species' roles are an intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Agroforestry land-use systems in the Andean region have great socioeconomical and biophysical relevance due to the abundance of products and services they provide. Biomass estimation in these systems constitutes a priority concern as it facilitates assessment of carbon sink potential and functionality for biomass production. In this paper, a set of equations were fitted to enable easy and reliable estimation of the total aboveground biomass of four frequently used species in Andean agroforestry systems: Acacia melanoxylon L., Alnus acuminata Kunth., Buddleja coriacea Remy. and Polylepis racemosa Ruiz&Pav. The best models for each biomass component (stem, thick branches, thin branches and leaves) per species were fitted simultaneously according to SUR methodology (seemingly unrelated regressions). All models showed high goodness of fit statistics and more than 70% of the observed variation in biomass components was explained by the independent variables. The inclusion of height as a predictive variable in the models improved their predictive reliability and expanded the application range. The models developed here are useful for assessing the sustainability of agroforestry systems and could support governmental or non-governmental forest conservation incentive programs and initiatives.

AB  - The biodiversity of actinobacteria in the Mediterranean Sea habitat has drawn limited attention compared to that paid to terrestrial habitats. The work presented here focused on the biodiversity of culturable marine actinobacteria from sediments and seawater collected from the Algerian coast, and led to the identification of 114 actinobacterial isolates. The morphological study revealed higher actinobacterial diversity in sediment than in seawater. Fifty strains were selected for 16 S rRNAgene sequencing. The results revealed that the isolates belonged to ten different genera, Streptomyces (n = 17) and Micromonospora (n = 15) being the most dominant. The remaining actinobacterial isolates, identified as belonging to rare genera, included Nocardia (n = 5), Nocardiopsis (n = 3), Saccharothrix (n = 2), Rhodococcus (n = 2), Promicromonospora (n = 2), Nonomuraea (n = 2), Actinomadura (n = 1) and Saccharomonospora (n = 1). Interestingly, through 16 S rRNA sequence-based identification and phylogenetic analysis, two strains of the genus Streptomyces (MAT1 and MAS22) and a strain of the genus Nonomuraea (MAG8) both constituted a novel species. Screening of antibacterial activity of identified isolates against a panel of human pathogenic bacteria demonstrated that 36% of the isolates were active, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. The ability to grow in the presence of NaCl and seawater revealed that 98% of the strains were halotolerant, with different levels of NaCl acceptance (from 3 to 13%) but no isolates required seawater to grow.

AB  - Two taxa are usually recognized in Scandinavian Pseudorchis albida s.1. (Orchidaceae), the lowland to subalpine P. albida s.s., and the alpine P straminea. We used allozymes to study the genetical differentiation within and among populations and taxa. Four populations of P albida s.s. and two populations of P straminea, all from Sweden, were included in the study. Eighteen loci of thirteen different enzyme systems were analyzed. Five loci were variable within, or between, the taxa. The taxa had different alleles at one of the five variable loci, whereas there was overlap at four loci. In all, 22 different alleles were found. Two of these alleles were confined to P. albida s.s., while four alleles were confined to P. straminea. In P albida s.s., one locus out of 15 (6.7 %) was polymorphic. In P. straminea, three loci out of 18 (16.7 %) were polymorphic. In both taxa, the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus was 2.0 (each polymorphic locus had two alleles). Nei's genetic identity was 0.81 between taxa, and about 1 among populations of P albida s.s., while the identity between the two populations of P straminea was 0.98. Although the differentiation is small, present-day distributions of taxa suggest that the divergence probably started before the Weichselian glaciation. The low within-taxon and within-population variation in Scandinavia may be due to ancient founder events. The association of P. albida s.s. with anthropogenic hay-meadows and open woodland and the association of P straminea with open mountain habitats suggest that taxa may have immigrated into Scandinavia at different times.

The focus is on treatment of household waste, to illustrate what can be done to establish a sustainable waste treatment system with high recovery of materials and energy. The various processes have resulted in a low amount of landfilled household waste, and high proportions of recovered energy and materials. Heat, electricity, vehicle fuel and fertilizers, metals and construction materials are recovered from the local waste in Boras, with less than 4% of domestic waste being sent to landfill.

AB  - This article summarizes parts of the work conducted in the Kolarctic ENPI project "Sustainable Buildings for the High North" (SBHN). SBHN had strong focus towards residential buildings performance in the northern Nordic and north-west parts of Russia (Barents region). Results show that there is large potential for improvement of the building mass both with respect to energy consumption and building management. The study reveals some important reasons for the differences between the countries. Regarding energy efficiency, the motivation for improving existing buildings energy performance always has a strong economic component. The end user/building owner assesses different measures in the light of investment cost and payback over time. If weak economic incentives exist, building owners are not likely to make investments to improve energy performance of their properties. In particular for Russia, such incentives are weak. In most areas, energy is paid by square meter residential area or even volume, not by actual usage, which means that whatever is used of energy, the total paid price will still be the same. Costly energy efficiency measures are thus not encouraged. Another problem in Russia is how to maintain and manage the shared areas of existing apartment buildings, such as exterior building parts (walls, roof etc.), stairways, technical rooms, storage rooms, outdoor areas etc. The main problem is that no one takes responsibility for this, and as a result the buildings are slowly deteriorating. Management, and consequently modernization, of building facilities is hence a major challenge. It is particularly important in the cold climate regions, where buildings often are exposed to harsh climatic conditions.

AB  - We analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in the Cs-137 activity concentrations in global ocean surface seawater from 1956 to 2021 using the HAMGlobal2021 (Historical Artificial radioactivity database in Marine environment, Global integrated version 2021) and other published data. The global ocean was divided into 37 boxes. When observing the 0.5-year median value of Cs-137 in each box in the Pacific Ocean, we noticed that the values gradually increased or had almost constant levels in the 1950s and 1960s, and then decreased exponentially in 1970-2010, immediately before the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Station (F1NPS) accident. In the northern North Atlantic Ocean and its marginal sea, the 0.5-year median values of Cs-137 showed large variations in the directly discharged Cs-137 from the reprocessing plants. The Cs-137 inventory in the surface mixed layer in 1970, when Cs-137 was released into the surface seawater, was estimated to be 184 +/- 26 PBq. In 1975 and 1980, the Cs-137 inventory increased to 201 +/- 27 and 214 +/- 11 PBq, respectively, due to direct discharge from the Sellafield and La Hague nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. In 2011, the Cs-137 inventory in the global ocean mixed layer increased to 50.7 +/- 7.3 PBq compared to that before the F1NPS accident, in which the contribution from the accident was estimated to be approximately 15.5 +/- 3.9 PBq. Mass balance analysis indicates that Cs-137 deposited by the global fallout in the western North Pacific Ocean moved to the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Subsequently, Cs-137 was transported southwards, followed by westward transport in the subtropical and equatorial Pacific Ocean, and then inflowed into the Indian Ocean via the Indonesian Archipelago. The longer apparent half-residence times in the Indonesian Archipelago (36.7 years from 1973 to 1997) and central Atlantic Ocean (38.0 years from 1992 to 2016) also support the interpretation of the global-scale transport of Cs-137 from the western North Pacific Ocean to the Indian (20-30 years) and Atlantic oceans (30-40 years). In the northern North Atlantic Ocean and its marginal sea, Cs-137 discharged from nuclear reprocessing plants is transported to the North Sea, Barents Sea and coast of Norway, and Arctic Ocean on a decadal scale.

AB  - Poor public perception call obstruct a construction project in a damaging way. Knowledge about public opinion should be considered as a relevant area of expertise for project managers and as an essential cost element in the planning and completion of construction projects.
   A consensual approach to a siting controversy requires informal face-to-face interaction among chosen representatives from all stake-holding groups. The basis of a consensual approach is to seek all-gain solutions rather than win-lose solutions or political compromise.
   Consensual approaches to solve conflicts between project stakeholders should increase the efficiency in the construction process. Conflicts between project stakeholders should be solved in dialogue to seek the best solution for all parties, instead of end up in court where the purpose is to interpret the law, not to reconcile conflicting interests.
   This paper will describe a consensual approach to siting controversy, with focus on analysis and managment of project stakeholders. The City tunnel project in Malmoe, Sweden, is used to exemplify a stakeholder managment process and how their efforts correspond to a consensual approach.

AB  - Background Subarctic regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change, yet little is known about nutrient availability and biodiversity of their cave ecosystems. Such knowledge is crucial for predicting the vulnerability of these ecosystems to consequences of climate change. Thus, to improve our understanding of life in these habitats, we characterized environmental variables, as well as bacterial and invertebrate communities of six subarctic caves in Northern Norway. Results Only a minuscule diversity of surface-adapted invertebrates were found in these caves. However, the bacterial communities in caves were compositionally different, more diverse and more complex than the nutrient-richer surface soil. Cave soil microbiomes were less variable between caves than between surface communities in the same area, suggesting that the stable cave environments with tougher conditions drive the uniform microbial communities. We also observed only a small proportion of cave bacterial genera originating from the surface, indicating unique cave-adapted microbial communities. Increased diversity within caves may stem from higher niche specialization and levels of interdependencies for nutrient cycling among bacterial taxa in these oligotrophic environments. Conclusions Taken together this suggest that environmental changes, e.g., faster melting of snow as a result of global warming that could alter nutrient influx, can have a detrimental impact on interactions and dependencies of these complex communities. This comparative exploration of cave and surface microbiomes also lays the foundation to further investigate the long-term environmental variables that shape the biodiversity of these vulnerable ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change enables expansion of southern species whereas many boreal species retreat northwards. Range shifts create novel interactions that can affect abundance and distribution via competition and/or hybridization. It is possible that the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) long-term decline in northern Europe is linked to competition with the brown hare (L. europaeus). In order to understand consequences of hare interactions at high latitudes, we determined geographical extent of hybridization using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression as a proxy. Additionally, we compared species distribution and snow conditions in Finland with introgression frequency. We found that introgression is bidirectional but direction is mostly from the mountain hare to the brown hare. Approximately 10% of brown hares have introgressed mtDNA, being most common at the northern expansion front of their distribution range. Introgression is likely linked to brown hare expansion facilitated by climate change, but due to complex nature of evolutionary processes, selective advantage cannot be fully excluded.

AB  - The growing grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Baltic Sea has created conflicts with local fisheries, comparable to similar emerging problems worldwide. Adequate information on the foraging habits is a requirement for responsible management of the seal population. We investigated the applicability of available dietary assessment methods by comparing morphological analysis and DNA metabarcoding of gut contents (short-term diet; n = 129/125 seals, respectively), and tissue chemical markers i.e. fatty acid (FA) profiles of blubber and stable isotopes (SIs) of liver and muscle (mid- or long-term diet; n = 108 seals for the FA and SI markers). The methods provided complementary information. Short-term methods indicated prey species and revealed dietary differences between age groups and areas but for limited time period. In the central Baltic, herring was the main prey, while in the Gulf of Finland percid and cyprinid species together comprised the largest part of the diet. Perch was also an important prey in the western Baltic Proper. The DNA analysis provided firm identification of many prey species, which were neglected or identified only at species group level by morphological analysis. Liver SIs distinguished spatial foraging patterns and identified potentially migrated individuals, whereas blubber FAs distinguished individuals frequently utilizing certain types of prey. Tissue chemical markers of adult males suggested specialized feeding to certain areas and prey, which suggest that these individuals are especially prone to cause economic losses for fisheries. We recommend combined analyses of gut contents and tissue chemical markers as dietary monitoring methodology of aquatic top predators to support an optimal ecosystem-based management.

AB  - 1 Aphids, similar to all insects, are ectothermic and, consequently, are greatly affected by environmental conditions. The peach potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) has a global distribution, although it is not known whether populations display regional adaptations to distinct climatic zones along its distribution and vary in their ability to withstand and acclimate to temperature extremes. In the present study, lethal temperatures were measured in nine anholocyclic clones of M. persicae collected along a latitudinal cline of its European distribution from Sweden to Spain. The effects of collection origin and intra- and intergenerational acclimation on cold and heat tolerance, as determined by upper and lower lethal temperatures (ULT50 and LLT50, respectively), were investigated. 2 Lethal temperatures of M. persicae were shown to be plastic and could be altered after acclimation over just one generation. Lower lethal temperatures were significantly depressed in eight of nine clones after acclimation for one generation at 10 degrees C (range: -13.3 to -16.2 degrees C) and raised after acclimation at 25 degrees C (range: -10.7 to -11.6 degrees C) compared with constant 20 degrees C (range: -11.9 to -12.9 degrees C). Upper lethal temperatures were less plastic, although significantly increased after one generation at 25 degrees C (range: 41.842.4 degrees C) and in five of nine clones after acclimation at 10 degrees C. There was no evidence of intergenerational acclimation over three generations. 3 Thermal tolerance ranges were expanded after acclimation at 10 and 25 degrees C compared with constant 20 degrees C, resulting in aphids reared at 10 degrees C surviving over a temperature range that was approximately 26 degrees C greater than those reared at 25 degrees C. 4 There was no clear relationship between lethal temperatures and latitude. Large scale mixing of clones may occur across Europe, thus limiting local adaption in thermal tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, notably with Type O clones being the most thermal tolerant. Clonal types may respond independently to climate change, affecting the relative proportions of clones within populations, with consequent implications for biodiversity and agriculture.

AB  - Maintenance of diversity of life in the sea and supporting sustainable use of marine resources require an ecosystem approach. The principles of differentiation of large geographical units on the ecosystem basis that could be applied in research and for the assessment and management of ecosystems and resources in the Baltic Sea have not been satisfactorily formulated up to now. Long-term data series collected by the authors and literature sources were used to subdivide the Baltic Sea into regional ecosystem units. Ten regions (Kattegat, Belts and the Sound, Arkona, Southwest, Eastern and Northwest of the Baltic Proper, Gulf of Riga, Gulf of Finland, Bothnian Sea, Bothnian Bay) were differentiated, some of them including sub-regions. They were grouped into three macroregions (the Transition Area, Baltic Proper and Large Gulfs). Hydrodynamic and geomorphological characters and the areas of local populations of organisms developed as a result of adaptation of species to their habitats constituted the main basis of the division. Circular cyclonic density-dependent currents in the deeps facilitate levelling of the conditions and integrate ecosystems in the regions. They are also responsible for the establishment of the regional depots of nutrients. The nutrients for the biological production are supplied mainly via the zones of intense vertical mixing (high-energy zones) to the euphotic layer. The regions differ in essential environmental conditions. In the process of adaptation to their habitats fishes (herring Clupea harengus membras, sprat Sprattus sprattus balticus, cod Gadus morhua callarias, flounder Platichthys flesus trachurus etc.) and other organisms have developed infraspecific units. The ecosystems and infraspecific units of exploited species should be assessed and managed separately if their vital parameters significantly differ from one another.

AB  - Efficient and purposeful transport of food, from primary production to waste management, is essential to drive the necessary transition towards sustainable production and consumption of food within planetary boundaries. This is particularly the case for bread, one of the most frequently wasted food items in Europe. In Sweden, bread is often sold under a take-back agreement where bakeries are responsible for transportation up to the supermarket shelf and for the collection of unsold products. This provides an opportunity for reverse logistics, but creates a risk of inefficient transport that could reduce the environmental benefits of prevention and valorization of surplus bread. This study assessed the climate change impact of bread transport in Sweden and evaluated the impact of alternative food transport pathways. Life cycle assessment revealed the climate change impact of conventional bread transport, from bakery gate to waste management, to be on average 49.0 g CO2e per kg bread with 68 % deriving from long-distance transport, 26 % from short-distance delivery, and 6 % from waste transport. Evalua-tion of alternative bread transport pathways showed the highest climate savings with a collaborative transport approach that also reduced the need for small vehicles and decreased transport distances. The overall contribu-tion of waste transport to the total climate impact of food transport was low for all scenario routes analyzed, sug-gesting that food waste management facilitating high-value recovery and valorization could be prioritized without increasing the climate impact due to longer transport. It has been claimed that conventional take-back agreements are responsible for most of the climate change impact related to bread transport, but we identified long distances between bakeries and retailers as the main contributor to transport climate impacts.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The first two words in the headline allude to a never-ending pursuit of something which is elusive say sustainability, with this endless and dogged keeping-on taking the name sustainable development. The last two would indicate that what we are talking about could be a zero-sum game. Whether or not even a Pyrrhic victory would be attained when it comes to sustaining the water resources on Terra Firma, is difficult to say, realistically speaking. A struggle it promises to be, nevertheless... partly-Sisyphean. As the Norwegian explorer, scientist and environmentalist Thor Heyerdahl said, Life originated in the sea. All life on land is dependent on the unique hydrological cycle which has been designed so meticulously by Nature. Mankind needs to work together with Nature, so that both are saved.

AB  - This study is based on a follow-up in 2014 of a survey conducted in 2003 among Swedish child welfare social workers. The same questionnaire used in 2003 (n = 309) was distributed to social workers (n = 349) who, in 2014, were working with the same types of tasks as in the previously investigated areas. The overall aim was to examine and analyse how working conditions have developed over these eleven years. From the results, two general patterns emerge. The first shows a deterioration of their working conditions, with higher work demands, increased role conflicts and less possibility to influence important decisions. The intention to leave the workplace or the profession had also increased. The second overall pattern concerns the emerging changes in job content, where the work today seems to be focused on conducting investigations whereas the vast majority of the social workers in 2003 also mentioned other tasks, such as giving advice and support, as being part of their job content. Contrary to their wishes, the social workers of today seem to have less time to devote to direct contact with clients. The consequences of these changes for the professional role of social workers and for their clients are discussed.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to quantify the potential levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) and cost savings from a set of households' energy saving measures, considered as "everyday choices". Design/methodology/approach Four areas of living were selected for the study: household electricity, space heating, transport and food consumption. The study used a quantitative research approach in which the impact of selected scenarios of an average Finnish household was assessed. Findings Findings suggest that GHG savings from behavioural change regarding household electricity remain marginal in comparison to savings gained from transportation related measures. Transportation also provides the most cost-efficient ways to decrease GHGs but not in all cases. Based on the results, the authors suggest that smart technologies, such as on-line, active feedback systems could have a major role in guiding household energy use. Also, given the high GHG savings from transport, the authors highlight the importance of providing infrastructure and services for clean mobility, and in designing well-functioning and compact cities enabling shorter travels. Originality/value The aim of our study was twofold - by analysing the case household's choices, we obtained information on environmental and economic impacts, but in addition to this, the aim was to open discussion on the role of households in tackling climate change and how to support households in making sustainable choices. Although research regarding household energy behaviour is vast, so far very few studies have focused on both economic and environmental impacts of households' everyday actions.

AB  - Aims The aim of this study is to explore and describe nurse leaders' (NLs) experiences of the role of advanced practice nurses (APNs).
   Background The first group of advanced practice nurses (17) in Finland graduated in 2006 and were thereafter employed by seven different organizations in more or less clearly defined advanced practice nurses roles.
   Methods Seven nurse leaders at the relevant organizations were interviewed a year after the introduction of the advanced practice nurses role. Content analysis was used to analyze the data.
   Results All of the nurse leaders emphasized the importance of the advanced practice nurses role in their organization. The advanced practice nurses' scope of practice comprised a more autonomous and independent role than registered nurses. Advanced practice nurses are an important resource in the care of patients with chronic diseases and acute health problems. An important aspect regarding support for the advanced practice nurses role is the provision of information to all health-care personnel and patients about the role and clearly defined areas of responsibility.
   Conclusions Advanced practice nurses are an important resource in the development of evidence-based nursing and improve the availability of health-care services for patients.
   Implications for nursing management Nurse leaders are responsible for creating sustainable structures and the prerequisites needed for advanced practice nursing through the formation of supportive organizational systems.

AB  - Development of social responsibility currently touches both business and public sectors, not only in the area of state administration but also in the field of tertiary education. This thesis introduces an example of current social responsibility engagement of a particular faculty of economics of a public university in the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on ISO 26 000 standard. The principal drawbacks are found in the very first key area - organisation management, but despite that the assessed faculty has performed numerous socially responsible activities. The present paper is a part of the research on "Institutional Cooperation in Responsible and Sustainable Education" with Hedmark University College donated by Norway Grants CZ07.

AB  - Background Previous research has established exposure to workplace aggression as a significant risk factor for employee functioning, well-being, and health. However, less is known about effective prevention and management strategies. The main objectives of the current project were to determine the impact of physical and psychological aggression on the well-being, health, and work ability of employees in the child welfare service and to establish whether a strong psychosocial safety climate and an ethical infrastructure are effective with regard to protecting employees against aggression. This project may help identify the specific risks child welfare workers are exposed to, the impact of workplace aggression on their health and well-being, and the most effective strategies to manage the problem. Furthermore, the findings should be central for developing laws and regulations and to any political decision on measures to tackle aggression in the workplace. Methods The study will employ two prospective data collections. Firstly, a three-wave longitudinal survey with a 6-month time lag between measurement points will be conducted among all 1,500 employees in the child welfare services in Oslo Municipality, Norway. Data will have a multilevel structure and will be linked to registry data on sickness absence. Secondly, a quantitative daily diary study over a 14-day period will include 150 of the respondents from the main survey study. The survey questionnaires mainly comprise well-established and psychometrically validated indicators of workplace aggression, health and well-being, psychosocial safety climate, ethical infrastructure, and other relevant factors. The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway (REC South East) have approved this project (project no. 28496). Discussion This project will identify the impact of workplace aggression on child protection workers as well as provide information on how organizations can actively manage exposure to workplace aggression. The findings may serve as a starting point for intervention studies as well as the development of policies and guidelines on how to handle workplace aggression.

AB  - PurposeIncreasing focus on sustainability, in general, climate change impact, circular economy and a substantial need for CO2 footprint reduction within the construction industry, requires new knowledge and processes regarding the existing buildings. To satisfy new laws and regulations for new buildings is an easier challenge in comparison with possibilities in existing building stock which has the biggest contribution to sustainability within the construction industry. The purpose of the study is to develop and present a standardized process for sustainable refurbishment which, in addition to technical aspects, has a goal to create "well-being" for stakeholders, people organizations in private and public businesses and society itself. Design/methodology/approachThe latest state of the art in the mentioned field has been assessed, and the developments along with potential future research focus have been identified. The process is presented in this paper, from the starting point of establishing the Norwegian standards in 1995 (NS 3454) until now, the development of the new CEN standard (prEN 17860:2022). The basic methodology designed for NS 3454 was improved through Nordic tools for indicator requirements SURE 1 (2011) and SURE 2 (2015). Further development of the tool was adopted by CEN TC 350 Sustainable Construction in 2017 with the aim to extend the good Nordic practices to the European level. In the paper, the design of the new standard prEN 17860:2022 is presented, from the process and content perspective, following the Nordic approach of standardized methodology and enhancing it with new dimensions and evaluation tools. Throughout the years, the standardized methodology, based on NS 3424, has been implemented in practical use for facility management in the Norwegian public sector. Positive experiences and feedback from this practical implementation have been taken into consideration in prEN 17680:2022. FindingsThe authors present the guidance, developed as a process, leading facility managers and other stakeholders through sustainable refurbishment standards and rules to make a clear decision about their concrete investment. The tool enables decisions about all three sustainability pillars and better decisions for health, well-being and quality of life. All the characteristics of the standardized methodology from the Nordic approach were supplemented (technical aspects; adaptability; usability; social aspects; energy, water and operational impacts and quality of indoor environment including health aspects) and some new were added (economic, feasibility, climate resilience and embodied environmental impacts). The tool also presents a building performance profile for further service life. Social implicationsSustainable cities have been a focus for many years now from various perspectives such as SURE 1 or 2 and CEN TC 350. What these studies neglect is a clear and helpful guideline, supporting the FM, users and investors while deciding the operating and maintaining infrastructure in an urban environment. Better standardized forms give the possibility to make better climate-neutral choices and keep the well-being focus by choosing buildings with a potential for a long lifetime. Originality/valueThe new focus of addressing all stakeholders, including people, promoting sustainable refurbishment by informing, engaging and empowering them to take the decisions.

AB  - Swedish recycling businesses argue that the Non-Toxic Environmental target gets too much weight and that resource efficiency gets too little focus, which results in decreased recycling. The purpose of this paper is to highlight different factors that recycling of waste decisions should consider, as well as contributing to a constructive discussion of the overall principles and policies for recycling. How recycling works in practice is explored based on nine interviews with stakeholders from the governmental agency level to recycling businesses. Theory with regards to ethics, risk, decision-making, governmental policy and laws is summarised. Finally, the discrepancy and connection between practice and theory is analysed. If recycling of waste is seen as a decision problem, the choice is between to recycle (in different ways) or not to recycle (i.e., energy recovery and/or landfill). Based on risk and decision theory, all relevant goals should be considered. This requires a broader problem framing when goals are in conflict. All parties agree that recycled and virgin material should be treated equally. From a higher policy perspective, it should then be demonstrated that any use of material (recycled and/or virgin) minimize environmental impact and promotes long-term sustainability.

AB  - Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are a critical factor in road traffic safety for "Vision Zero-events", defined as road accidents with fatalities and serious injuries. The bending and breaking of safety-related rules in the HGV-sector, such as not following rest and work hour regulations, not securing cargo sufficiently, or not following the regulations concerning cabotage, in the commercial goods transport sector is a cause for concern and has in a very limited degree been studied as a system problem. This paper suggests that deregulation and international competition in the transport sector are bringing about a working climate where even serious safety-minded actors in the HGV business find themselves needing to cut corners to stay in business. The current situation in the Norwegian HGV sector is such that the organization of the business, the market development and the regulatory regimes are in effect transferring the responsibility for traffic safety vertically downwards to the actors at the lowest levels of the transport system. These actors are the truck drivers, who often bend and break rules to perform their work on time. This paper presents a scoping study designed to address the concept of rule bending in the HGV transport sector, using a combination of peer reviewed literature and a heterogeneous sample of grey literature from the transport sector. The scoping study shows how the scientific literature discusses violations and transgressions as both intentional and nonintentional acts but does not adequately describe how certain types of behaviour differ from overt violations and transgressions. The actions are simply considered violations that are devoid of meaning and both systemic and cultural context. We suggest a conceptualization of rule bending and rule breaking as "Adaptive Non-conforming Behaviour (ANB)" that builds on the context found in the grey literature. Further, the conceptualization provides a framework for the recognition of ANB, dimensions for further study and an outlined research design. We believe there is a need to increase system knowledge because safety analysis lacks in-depth insight into how the system affect the working practices in the HGV sector. The justification of the ANB approach is that it can be incorporated into safety and risk assessments of the transport sector, to provide a framework for context-sensitive studies that are non-normative, less concerned with violations as rule breaking, and more concerned with rule bending as a system wide problem.

AB  - Since the 1980s, single-layered conifer forests are being restored to natural mixed stands by introducing European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in keeping with the goal of sustainable forest management.
   Typically European beech are planted under a Norway spruce canopy maintain the option of high quality wood production. So far, the question of optimal aggregate area size with regard to the influence of edge effects on the quality development of European beech has not be addressed adequately. Therefore, in this study, the influence of edge effects on the quality of advanced-planted beech in clustered and clumped aggregates under a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) shelter was examined.
   The study areas were located in the Tharandt Forest (Free State of Saxony). In each of the 10 European beech clusters (ca. 10-15 m diameter) and-clumps (ca. 30-50 m diameter), the quality (Fig. 2) of selected European beech trees was assessed (Fig. 1). The age of European beech in the advanced plantings was between 16 and 20 years. At all study sites, plant densities (1.8/2 m x 0.7/0.8 m) and canopy cover conditions were comparable (Table 1).
   The results showed that European beech trees along the edge revealed larger branches (Fig. 6), shorter branch-free trunk sections (Fig. 5), and higher densities of live branches compared to trees within the aggregate centers. This effect was independent of aggregate size. However, after bringing together all quality parameters (Table 2), the edge effect was found to extend not more than 3 m into the aggregate areas (Fig. 7). This was confirmed in an assessment of the influence of the edge effect on the diameter of the largest dead and live branches using the linear mixed effects models (LMM) (Table 4). Along the 3 m edge strip towards the aggregate center, the quality and competition increased continually. Yet intraspecific competition was largely determined by plant spacing. A correlation between aggregate area size and intensity of competition pressure could not be proven (Fig. 4).
   Differences in quality development of European beech in cluster- and clump aggregates were not found (Fig. 3). Thus, it seems possible to produce potentially high quality timber of European beech in the center of clusters and clump aggregates. Although the edge effect was restricted to a small strip around the advanced planted beech aggregates regardless of aggregate area size, it would still seem more practical in forest management to establish larger aggregates with a higher probability of producing high quality wood.
   Furthermore stumps and canopy trees left in the aggregate centers lead to higher variation in the planting density, which means that the restriction in side branch development from neighboring trees decreases, thereby increasing growing space and light availability (Fig. 8). This results in a one-sided crown expansion and the development of larger branches. Therefore it is necessary to achieve homogeneous plant spacing in young European beech stands, and to attain appropriate Norway spruce canopy densities before establishing advanced planted European beech aggregates.

AB  - HUBERT GUZIK Collective Houses and the Social Policy of Czech Industrial Enterprises in 1939-1953 Right after the Second World War, two collective houses were built in the industrial towns of Litvinov and Zlin in what was then Czechoslovakia. Each building provided housing for families, a central dining hall, a nursery school, and a wide array of cultural and social services, all under just one roof. The architectural precursors of these two buildings were found in the USSR, Sweden and France, but the Czech koldomy (collective houses) originated independently of their counterparts abroad. They drew on sociological concepts of industrial towns developed by the management of the Bata shoemaking enterprise in Zlin during the Nazi occupation. Inspired by German industrial sociology, the Baia Company were looking at that time for ways in which to maintain social solidarity, stability, and the moral profile of its employees. The company's management concluded that collective houses would be better than the garden city model of housing at generating social solidarity. This form of construction was well suited to the country's new political-economic direction after 1945, which combined elements of capitalism, corporatism, and state socialism, and left industrial enterprises a certain degree of freedom in the area of social policy. The management of the national chemical enterprise Stalin Works wanted the construction of collective housing in Litvinov to signal the humanistic dimension of industrial enterprises in the socialist state. The rapid industrialisation of Czechoslovakia after 1948 ultimately led to the failure of both buildings. The mass relocation of employees broke down the stability of workplace collectives, and the voluntary emancipation of women through work, expressed in architectural form in both collective buildings, was supplanted by the forced feminisation of the labour force. Collective housing was met with little support even among architects, who found that the social goals of the state could be better fulfilled by cheap prefab housing estates than by the romantically singular collective houses.

AB  - Derivations of the maritime place name *S AE heimr-'the settlement by the sea'-are known from 54 examples from different parts of Scandinavia. Traditionally, these are thought to describe merely a feature of the terrain that defined a site's location by the sea, a fjord or a lake. Consequently, they have not been the focus of archaeological research. By analysing the sites' topographical, archaeological-historical and onomastic settings, the theory developed in this article is that the derivations of the place name *S AE heimr denote outlying landing sites of central place complexes that were established in the Roman Iron Age and Migration Period. In this respect, the phenomenon fits with and supplements the traditional Scandinavian concept of the Iron Age central place complex, in which stereotypical place names denote specific central functions, in this case maritime activities such as landing, trading, seasonally practised crafts, and defence. Market functions and the long-term exchange of goods, in particular, are collaborated by many sources. Landing and trade seem to have been prominent activities at these sites, which also show a striking coincidence with far-reaching waterways of strategic and commercial significance. In contrast to place names denoting Viking Age and medieval harbours and maritime market places, there is a dearth of corresponding names for the early Iron Age. The place name *S AE heimr and its assumed eastern-Swedish counterpart Satuna might fill this vacuum, and constitute a valuable tool for research and cultural heritage management regarding the identification of landing and trading sites established in the early Iron Age.

AB  - Innovation is critical for any organization to maintain sustainability and to grow. In today's world, where environmental concerns are constantly increasing, companies must adopt greener innovation strategies. These greener ways of innovating promote the monitoring and preserving of our now endangered environment. Current literature lacks data concerning the necessary skills to ease the implementation of green innovations in certain regions, one of them the Vaasa region in Finland. The aim of this study is therefore to identify those skills that can be diffused through necessary educational programs and training. Such necessary skills can be disseminated through the establishment of a Center of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) in a country or region, being this a suitable way by which educational programs and training can be offered. The skills needed for green innovation in the Vaasa region in Finland were collected through two extensive workshops, a series of semi-structured interviews, and a set of questionnaire surveys. This study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods to meet the expected goals. From the study results, it is noticed that establishing a CoVE can be a good source for the regional companies to get a skilled workforce, which is ultimately essential to adopt a green and sustainable innovation mindset in their products and services development processes. The study is concluded with further research directions.

AB  - Soybean is a legume used world-wide for food and fodder. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen and symbiotically produces high quality protein, and is therefore a valuable crop to include in any crop rotation. Currently Sweden imports large quantities of soybean, notwithstanding the negative impact on the environment, owing to, e.g., deforestation in countries where soybeans are produced and the use of long transportation routes. When cultivating soybeans on juvenile soils, which are common in Sweden, they need to be inoculated with their symbiotic partner, the bacteria Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Task of the present study was to investigate the need for re-inoculation of soybeans in cropping sequences where soybeans are included. For this purpose we collected samples from soils in which soybeans had been grown previously and used these soils to grow soybeans in a greenhouse. We found that B. japonicum survived in the soils in which soybeans had been grown previously. Soil factors such as pH, nitrogen content and organic matter showed varying and inconsistent effects on the survival rate of B. japonicum, making it difficult to estimate their impact significance. However, application of nitrogen (as manure) and high amounts of phosphorus in soil appeared to promote B. japonicum survival. The amount of potassium in soil had varying effects, but high amounts appeared to impair B. japonicum survival. As regards to soil type, B. japonicum survived better in light soils than in clayey soils. We conclude that it could be recommended for growers not to re-incoulate their soybeans if the crop has been cultivated in recent years.

AB  - Research on online communities has shown that content production involves manifest groups and latent users. This paper conceptualizes a related but distinct phenomenon of latent groups. We ground this contribution in a longitudinal study on the Finnish Wikipedia (2007-2014). In the case of experts working on content within their area of expertise, individuals can constitute a group that maintains itself over time. In such a setting, it becomes viable to view the group as an acting unit instead of as individual nodes in a network. Such groups are able to sustain their activities even over periods of inactivity. Our theoretical contribution is the conceptualization of latent groups, which includes two conditions: 1) a group is capable of reforming after inactivity (i.e., dormant), and 2) a group is difficult to observe to an outsider (i.e., non-manifest).

AB  - The development of a sustainable sewerage system includes the utilisation of nutrients from human urine and faeces in agriculture. One strategy for developing a sustainable sewerage system is to handle urine separately and use it as a fertiliser. One important reason for this strategy is the fact that urine is the source of around 70% of phosphorus and around 90% of nitrogen in black wastewater (wastewater from water closets). However, experience From systems with urine separation is limited. In this study a urine separation system in an ''ecological'' village in northern Sweden has been investigated. The village consists of 17 self-contained houses and the number of inhabitants have varied around 55 persons. The sewerage system is equipped with urine separation toilers. Thus, the urine is intended to be collected separately and led through a sewer system to a collection tank for urine. However, the collected urine was found to be relatively diluted. This could to some extent be explained by errors in the construction of the toiler. However, the main reason for the dilution is probably leakage of water into the urine sewer system. The study also showed that less than about half of the nitrogen and phosphorus from human urine disposed of through the toilets of the village was successfully collected. Thus, the study shows that the successful operation of a urine separation system is very dependent on well-designed toilets and a user behaviour that promotes a high degree of separation.

AB  - The role of international standards is analysed in accordance with the quality management of organisations by the requirements of sustainable development. Organisations and companies become increasingly dependent on each other and foreign partners in business, prosperity, socio-economic change and environment responsibility. There is an essential necessity for using International Standards under these changing conditions. The management systems standards ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environment) have gained recognition in Lithuania. ISO 9001:2000 is approaching 750 and ISO 14001 is approaching 140 certifications across a diverse range of organisations in the manufacturing, service and government areas. The narrow view of quality management has now been swept aside by ISO 9000:2000 quality management principles that aim to help organisations achieve sustained success. But there are some difficulties in implementing these principles. Auditors are responsible for correct implementation of standards. For the auditors they represent a key for transforming the way quality system audits, as recognised by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF).
   Too many auditors lack real interpersonal skills or experience to engage effectively both main board directors and the shop floor workers. It is very important that auditors Must have sufficient preparation, training and gravitas and will be reluctant to engage top management and have capability to interface at this level.
   The main topics of how to manage quality audit according to the requirements and new quality management principles of ISO 9000:2000 standards are presented in this article. It also provides recommendations on the management of audit programmes, the conduct of internal or external audits of quality management systems, as well as on the competence and evaluation of auditors. This article provides auditors with effective questioning techniques that will enable them to establish that an organisation is managing its processes effectively.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL), combined with early patient contact, multiprofessional education and emphasis on development of communications skills, has become the basis for the medical curriculum at the Faculty of Health Sciences in Link ping (FHS), Sweden, which was started in 1986. Important elements in the curriculum are vertical integration, i.e. integration between the clinical and basic science parts of the curriculum and horizontal integration between different subject areas. This article discusses the importance of vertical integration in an undergraduate medical curriculum, according to experiences from the Faculty of Health Sciences in Link ping, and also give examples on how it has been implemented during the latest 15 years. Results and views put forward in published articles concerning vertical integration within undergraduate medical education are discussed in relation to the experiences in Link ping. Vertical integration between basic sciences and clinical medicine in a PBL setting has been found to stimulate profound rather than superficial learning, and thereby stimulates better understanding of important biomedical principles. Integration probably leads to better retention of knowledge and the ability to apply basic science principles in the appropriate clinical context. Integration throughout the whole curriculum entails a lot of time and work in respect of planning, organization and execution. The teachers have to be deeply involved and enthusiastic and have to cooperate over departmental borders, which may produce positive spin-off effects in teaching and research but also conflicts that have to be resolved. The authors believe vertical integration supports PBL and stimulates deep and lifelong learning.

AB  - We estimated the effects of different cutting heights and harvesting strategies on the amounts of harvestable residue biomasses and allocation of residue biomasses in the soil. A case study on regional straw biomass resources was performed with the different crops cultivated in Varsinais-Suomi (Southern Finland) at present (averages of 2003-2012) and in the predicted future warmer climate (scenario RCP 4.5, year 2055). We also estimated, with the help of the Yasso07 model, the effects of different residue incorporation intensities on soil organic carbon (SOC) at present and in the future warmer climate. The results suggested that cutting height has a significant impact on the amount of straw biomass incorporated in the soil and subsequent change in SOC. The impact depended on crop species and variety. When straw is collected and used e.g. in energy production, harvesting practices leaving greater stubble heights could help to maintain soil fertility. The Yasso07 model suggests that in the predicted future warmer conditions, more straw could be collected without decreasing SOC, as mineralization of SOC in the warmer climate is expected to increase less than organic carbon amendments caused by higher crop and root biomasses. Collection and usage of straw as a renewable energy source always decreases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. However, collecting straw every second year instead of every year, even with higher stubble, would decrease field traffic and spare the soil from compaction and the farmer from extra work, while still significantly decreasing GHG emissions.

AB  - With the expansion of vertical farming systems worldwide, many claims of the benefits of these systems are being used in media and by VF producers. Despite this, there is little support in the literature, with few studies assessing the sustainability, potential, and viability of these systems. This has caused a number of expectations and controversies to develop in society directed toward the vertical farming sector. This study analyzes the discourse and narratives being created around these systems in Sweden. We use a document analysis and study the discourse and narratives using Nvivo, with a large share of the material employed from national and regional newspapers published, in addition to webpages and press releases from vertical farms in Sweden. We found a number of emerging themes from different stakeholders. These include those related to the overall positive aspects of vertical farming, such as the contribution to resilience and self-sufficiency, resource efficiency, comparisons to conventional farming practices, and many studies on the future potential and directions these can take (e.g., expanding beyond leafy greens and herbs). There are also a number of studies that outline criticism of vertical farms based on their economic performance and viability, limited capacity, and resource intensity. As such, narratives on the technological advances, resilience, investment, and challenges of vertical farming are widespread. The results are important as they highlight the divergence in the narratives used and the evidence provided in the scientific literature, which can aid in developing new approaches and methods to validate claims and ensure these systems are both sustainable and viable.

AB  - The anthropogenic release of oil hydrocarbons into the cold marine environment is an increasing concern due to the elevated usage of sea routes and the exploration of new oil drilling sites in Arctic areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate prokaryotic community structures and the genetic potential of hydrocarbon degradation in the metagenomes of seawater, sea ice, and crude oil encapsulating the sea ice of the Norwegian fjord, Ofotfjorden. Although the results indicated substantial differences between the structure of prokaryotic communities in seawater and sea ice, the crude oil encapsulating sea ice (SIO) showed increased abundances of many genera-containing hydrocarbon-degrading organisms, including Bermanella, Colwellia, and Glaciecola. Although the metagenome of seawater was rich in a variety of hydrocarbon degradation-related functional genes (HDGs) associated with the metabolism of n-alkanes, and mono- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, most of the normalized gene counts were highest in the clean sea ice metagenome, whereas in SIO, these counts were the lowest. The long-chain alkane degradation gene almA was detected from all the studied metagenomes and its counts exceeded ladA and alkB counts in both sea ice metagenomes. In addition, almA was related to the most diverse group of prokaryotic genera. Almost all 18 good- and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) had diverse HDGs profiles. The MAGs recovered from the SIO metagenome belonged to the abundant taxa, such as Glaciecola, Bermanella, and Rhodobacteracea, in this environment. The genera associated with HDGs were often previously known as hydrocarbon-degrading genera. However, a substantial number of new associations, either between already known hydrocarbon-degrading genera and new HDGs or between genera not known to contain hydrocarbon degraders and multiple HDGs, were found. The superimposition of the results of comparing HDG associations with taxonomy, the HDG profiles of MAGs, and the full genomes of organisms in the KEGG database suggest that the found relationships need further investigation and verification.

AB  - We report the results of the first systematic assessment of global patterns and research priorities emerging in the field of rodent pest management. We carried out an extensive literature review targeted towards identifying the most relevant rodent pests, their impacts and the most common methods used to control them. We identified three disproportionally important pest species that are characterized by severe, generalist and geographically widespread impacts: the black rat Rattus rattus, the Norway rat Rattus norvegicus and the house mouse Mus musculus. Overall, only 7% of known rodent species may be considered pests. Scansorial (i.e. terrestrial and semi-arboreal) and fossorial species are generally important as pests, while aquatic and arboreal species have only specific impacts. Impacts of rodent pests on arable crops were studied most, followed by impacts on ecosystems. Studies on arable crops were typical in countries with low net income and health expenditure, while the opposite was observed for studies on ecosystems. Poisons were the most commonly used control method, followed by traps and habitat management. The need to control rodent species is expanding, especially to protect ecosystems and public health. Unlike in other fields of pest management (e.g. insect control), in rodent control we are approaching new problems with old solutions; control strategies and methods have not kept pace with emerging impacts. The need to control a rodent pest species is higher when it is non-native than within its original geographical range. The impact of a rodent species in its native range is a good predictor of the impact it may have in areas of introduction. Our review will contribute towards guiding researchers and stakeholders to focus research efforts and investments on a subset of species, and on new, less hazardous control techniques.

AB  - In this study, the performance of different cooling technologies from energy and economic perspectives were evaluated for six different prototype residential Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) within a planned future city district in central Sweden. This was carried out by assessing the primary energy number and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) for each building model and cooling technology. Projected future climate file representing the 2050s (mid-term future) was employed. Three cooling technologies (district cooling, compression chillers coupled/uncoupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems, and absorption chillers) were evaluated. Based on the results obtained from primary energy number and LCCA, compression chillers with PV systems appeared to be favorable as this technology depicted the least value for primary energy use and LCCA. Compared to compression chillers alone, the primary energy number and the life cycle cost were reduced by 13%, on average. Moreover, the district cooling system was found to be an agreeable choice for buildings with large floor areas from an economic perspective. Apart from these, absorption chillers, utilizing environmentally sustainable district heating, displayed the highest primary energy use and life cycle cost which made them the least favorable choice. However, the reoccurring operational cost from the LCCA was about 60 and 50% of the total life cycle cost for district cooling and absorption chillers, respectively, while this value corresponds to 80% for the compression chillers, showing the high net present value for this technology but sensitive to future electricity prices.

AB  - All over the world, elevated levels of metals and the toxic compound tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products are found in sediments, especially close to areas associated with shipping and anthropogenic activities. Ports require regular removal of sediments. As a result, large volumes of often contaminated sediments must be managed.
   The aim of this study was to investigate enhanced leaching as a treatment method for organotin (TBT) and metal (Cu and Zn) contaminated marine sediments. Thus, enabling the possibility to reuse these cleaner masses e. g. in construction. In addition to using acid and alkaline leaching agents that extract the OTs and metals but reduce the management options post treatment, innovative alternatives such as EDDS, hydroxypropyl cellulose, humic acid, iron colloids, ultra-pure Milli-Q water, saponified tall oil ("soap"), and NaCl were tested. Organotin removal ranged from 36 to 75%, where the most efficient leaching agent was Milli-Q water, which was also the leaching agent achieving the highest removal rate for TBT (46%), followed by soap (34%). The TBT reduction accomplished by Milli-Q water and soap leaching enabled a change in Swedish sediment classification from the highest class to the second highest class. The highest reduction of Zn was in HPC leached samples (39% removal) and Cu in EDDS leached samples (33% removal). Although high metal and OT leaching were achieved, none of the investigated leaching agents are sufficiently effective for the removal of both metals and OTs. The results of this study indicate that leaching with ultra-clean water, such as Milli-Q water, may be sufficient to treat TBT contaminated sediments and potentially allow mass reuse.

TI  - Antimicrobial feed additives or not - conflicts of aimes are inevitable
T2  - VITAMINS AND ADDITIVES IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
LA  - German
CP  - 5th Symposium on Vitamins and Additives in Human and Animal Nutrition
AB  - Since many years there is a widespread use of antimicrobial agents as growth promoters in animal production to improve daily gains and feed conversion rates.
   Especially in the last 2 years - enhanced by the discussion on Avoparcin - their use is critizised more and more. Various scientific organizations and the German association of veterinary practicioners, too, demand for the ban of all antibiotic substances as feed additives. The arguments are for example the toxicity of special substances, the lower effects under optimized housing conditions, the mode of application (without veterinary prescription), incompatibilities with therapeutics (ionophores / tiamulin), the risk for residues (substances absorbed from the intestine), intoxications in non-target-species (ionophores in horses) and especially the risk of development of resistance in bacteria.
   Especially as nutritionists we must not forget that various antimicrobial feed additives have distinct disease-preventing effects, are efficient in reducing pollution (methan, nitrogen, phosphorus), and in saving nutrients. We should consider experiences obtained in Sweden, where the use of antibiotic growth promoters is prohibited since 1986.
   Is it really a sign of progress when the same substances (for example olaquindox) are used as therapeutics now (prescribed by veterinarians) in a dosage of 100 - 160 ppm (in-feed-medication), whereas in former times the upper limit was 50 ppm? Can we accept that now zinc oxide is generally used in rearing piglets in a dosage of 3000 - 4000 mg/kg diet to prevent diarrhea and higher mortality rates?
   What are the reasons that make the use of antibiotics obviously essential? It is not the small (but significant) effect on growth and feed conversion rate, it is the risk of illness, of higher mortality in young animals. of economical losses due to these factors in large herds and production units. Is it even an utopian scheme to manage the "modern" production systems (specialized units, increased herd sire, necessity of transports, grouping, and others) without the shield of antibiotics? Is there eventually a need for a more critical look on the structure of animal production that has developed in recent years?

TI  - Individualised marketing:: Changing travel behaviour for a better environment
T2  - COMMUNICATING ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT: THE ROLE OF SOFT MEASURES
LA  - English
CP  - Workshop on Communicating Environmentally Sustainable Transport
AB  - The dependence on the car in everyday travel has increased enormously in the last decades. This has serious and growing consequences for the environment and health and for many communities damaged by road traffic. At the same time, these consequences are very expensive for business, environment and society. Ways have to be found to overcome this car dependency and make people use other modes of transport.
   The traditional approach to achieve mode change has been through the provision of transport services and infrastructure, including pricing and longer term land use policies. They are surely necessary for an increased use of the transport system, but they are only of limited value if people are unaware of the system improvements.
   In order to make people change their personal travel behaviour people need to be aware of decent alternatives to car travel. One might think that all necessary information about these alternatives walking, cycling and public transport - is readily available. But all empirical surveys show that this information does not reach the respective target group. If the concept of customer orientation is taken at all seriously, information has to be brought to the customer instead of expecting him/her to catch it from the provider.
   Recognising this lack of information and motivation that caused an opposition to the use of public transport Socialdata developed the concept of Individualised Marketing (IndiMark(R)), a dialogue-based technique for promoting the use of public transport, cycling and walking as alternatives to car travel. It is a programme based on a targeted, personalised, customised marketing approach which empowers people to change their travel behaviour. Using these "soft policies" to make people think about their travel behaviour has proven to be highly successful in achieving shifts in mode from the car; shifts that are proving to be sustained in the longer term.
   Socialdata conducted many pilot projects in different European countries and in Australia where Individualised Marketing has been applied successfully. In all these projects a reduction of car usage around 10% has been achieved. The increase especially in walking and cycling has been great. In the meantime there have been several large-scale applications with tens of thousands of participants. The evaluation of these projects shows that the reduction of car usage was even greater than in the pilot projects. The use of the car could be reduced by 14% in South Perth. Similar results were achieved in two other large scale applications in Germany (-12%) and Sweden (-13%) and evaluations made one and two years after the IndiMark(R)-campaign show that the results are sustainable. For environmentally friendly modes a strong increase in usage could be noticed. In the South Perth project for example increases in walking of 35%, cycling (61%) and public transport (117%) were reached. Results from other large scale applications will be available soon.
   This shows that Individualised Marketing is a cost-effective measure to reduce the number of car trips sustainably without constraining people's mobility. It is not necessary to completely change people's lifestyle. If everyone could change using public transport, walking or cycling just once a week instead of using the car, this would have a great effect overall. Reducing our reliance on cars has many environmental and health benefits-traffic congestion will decrease, air quality will improve, there would be less road trauma, and people will be fitter and healthier.

AB  - Submerged tar-contaminated sediment are generally very loose, which makes remediation challenging. We tested if a modified version of freeze-dredging could be used to remove and dewater such sediment in a canal down-stream a coking plant. PVC hoses carrying a heat medium were placed horizontally in the submerged sediment. Five days of freezing allowed straightforward removal of most of the sediment. Flat freeze cells were placed side by side in the canal to remove the rest. The freeze-thaw process increased the dry substance content from approximately 50 to 80%. Outdoors storage under rainy conditions did not re-wet the dried sediment. The material was successfully used as feed-stock in the coking plant, with the double cost-benefit of avoided transportation to deposit and reduced use of coal. The study demonstrates that freeze-dredging can facilitate removal, storage and beneficial re-use of submerged tar-contaminated sediment.

AB  - Atmospheric acidic depositions have strongly altered the functioning and biodiversity of Central European forest ecosystems. Most impacts occurred until the end of the 20th century but the situation substantially improved thereafter caused by legal regulations in the late 1980's to reduce acidifying atmospheric pollution. Since then slow recovery from acidification has been observed in forested catchments and adjacent waters. However, trends of recovery are inconsistent and underlying mechanisms diminishing recovery are still poorly understood.
   We propose that the input of road salt can significantly affect acidity regime and acidification recovery of forest ecosystems.
   By comparing the discharge hydro-chemistry and plant community composition of springs fed by forested catchments with and without high levels of salt input over two decades we observed a significant suppression of recovery and elevated levels of nutrient leaching (K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) in highly salt contaminated catchments. We show that the pollution of near-surface groundwater (interflow) by road salt application can have lasting effects on ecosystem processes over distances of several hundred metres apart from the salt emitting road.

AB  - Social innovations (SIs) are new ideas that create collaboration or new social relationships and thus meet local needs. The purpose of the research is to understand the role of SIs and community-based quadruple-helix actors in rural development. The research question is how do community-based quadruple-helix actors contribute to the formation of SI networks in the context of rural development?
   The triple helix model represents innovations as emerging in cooperation between three helices (university, industry, and government). The quadruple helix (QH) adds civil society as a fourth helix. Using the QH model in rural development requires a broad definition of the helices. In addition to universities, all types of educational and research institutes are important. In addition, different types of public organisations are important, not just the government. We define the fourth helix as representing civil society as a community, not just individual citizens. Our main argument is that the QH model fosters understanding of the variety of formal and informal ways in which SI enables societal development in rural areas. We examine the relevant relationships with the help of the strands of literature on SI and QH, and also a case study on projects conducted under the LEADER programme (Aktion Osterbotten) in Finland. The case study is based on a narrative approach inspired by the learning history method, with the identification of critical incidents, which help us to identify how the QH evolves throughout successful community-driven SIs. The narrative approach reveals the significance of informal communities in transforming QH relations.
   Many projects under the LEADER programme aim to strengthen the attraction of communities by promoting local identity, including broad participation in collective events, such as enjoying nature, cultural events, sports, and other social activities. Many of those activities have the potential to spill over into other types of SI, such as entrepreneurship oriented towards tourism and new solutions to social needs. The decisive factor for the success of the projects was the involvement of local communities. The local knowledge of the communities was nourished in the projects in interaction with other local and extra-local QH actors.
   Accordingly, the main contribution of the paper is combining the notions of SI and the QH, and presenting the fourth helix as a community enabling rural development. We call this rural development model the community-driven QH model.

AB  - Ditch cleaning (DC) is increasingly applied to facilitate forest regeneration following clear-cutting in Fennoscandinavia. However, its impact on the ecosystem carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances is poorly understood. We conducted chamber measurements to assess the initial DC effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a recent forest clear-cut on wet mineral soil in boreal Sweden. Measurements were conducted in two adjacent areas over two pre-treatments (2018/19) and two years (2020/21) after conducting DC in one area. We further assessed the spatial variation of fluxes at three distances (4, 20, 40 m) from ditches. We found that DC lowered the water table level by 12 +/- 2 cm (mean +/- standard error) and topsoil moisture by 0.12 +/- 0.01 m(3) m(-3). DC had a limited initial effect on the net CO2 exchange and its component fluxes. CH4 emissions were low during the dry pre-treatment years but increased particularly in the control area during the wet years of 2020/21. Distance to ditch had no consistent effects on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Model extrapolations suggest that annual carbon emissions decreased over the four years from 6.7 +/- 1.4 to 1.6 +/- 1.6 t-C ha(-1) year(-1), without treatment differences. Annual CH4 emissions contributed <2.5% to the carbon balance but constituted 39% of the GHG balance in the control area during 2021. Overall, our study suggests that DC modified the internal carbon cycling but without significant impact on the carbon and GHG balances.

AB  - This paper provides an economic sector level analysis of the effectiveness of different policy measures in decreasing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses from agriculture in order to reduce nutrient runoff from agricultural fields to watercourses and to improve water quality of surface waters. Assuming no changes in the EU level policies after CAP reform 2003 we focus on national level policy measures such as full or partial de-coupling of national support from production, payments for reduced nutrient surpluses of N and P, and N fertiliser tax.
   None of the analysed policy measures is superior one with respect to environmental performance, since full decoupling of national support would be the most effective in reducing P surpluses while payment for reduced nutrient surplus performed best with respect to N surpluses. Economic performance (farmers' compliance cost per %-reduction of N or P surplus) of full and partial de-coupling of national support is clearly better than that of specialised agri-environmental policy instruments, because both decoupling scenarios result in the increase of farmers' income in comparison to base scenario, and thus compliance costs are in fact negative in these two cases.
   Our analysis confirms the fact that the overall policy package matters a lot for the effectiveness of agri-environmental policy measures. Environmental performance of agri-environmental policy measures may be significantly reduced, if they are implemented jointly with production coupled income support policies. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental policy measures agricultural income support policies should be decoupled from production and this alone would bring substantial reduction in nutrient surpluses.

AB  - A changing climate that entails a growing number of hazards poses a challenge to communities across the world. Particularly exploited areas in mountain and maritime zones have become increasingly vulnerable. Homeowners in such areas has been identified as key actors in the pursuit of robust communities, though large groups of people tend to trust mainly in the risk management of local authorities. In order to achieve a better understanding in how individual homeowners address risks related to their properties and the ways in which they put their trust in the risk management in different actors, not only public authorities, we conducted interviews with homeowners in Sweden's largest ski resort, Are, in recent years affected by an increasing number of landslides. The empirical findings show that households have different targets of trust during different stages of a crisis, which also aligns with previous research. While the respondents worried about the overall development in the area, their main concerns were related to their properties and how a harsher climate would affect their economic value. The homeowners furthermore expressed that their trust in the municipality and the local entrepreneur that runs the ski resort is low when it comes to crisis management. Yet rural populations in general are used to handle crises on their own, as assistance from authorities usually takes longer time. It is thus important that the municipality and local entrepreneurs assume responsibility not to jeopardize sustainability in future exploitations in the area in order to establish trust in relation to local homeowners.

AB  - A basic premise of conservation geneticists is that low levels of genetic variation are associated with fitness costs in terms of reduced survival and fecundity. These fitness costs may frequently vary with environmental factors and should increase under more stressful conditions. However, there is no consensus on how fitness costs associated with low genetic variation change under natural conditions in relation to the stressfulness of the environment. On the Swedish west coast, natterjack toad Bufo calamita populations show a strong population genetic structure and large variation in the amount of within-population genetic variation. We experimentally examined the survival of natterjack larvae from six populations with different genetic variation in three thermal environments corresponding to (a) the mean temperature of natural ponds (stable, laboratory), (b) a high temperature environment occurring in desiccating ponds (stable, laboratory) and (c) an outdoor treatment mimicking the natural, variable thermal conditions (fluctuating, semi-natural). We found that larvae in the outdoor treatment had poorer survival than larvae in the stable environments suggesting that the outdoor treatment was more stressful. Overall, populations with higher genetic variation had higher larval survival. However, a significant interaction between treatments and genetic variation indicated that fitness costs associated with low genetic variation were less severe in the outdoor treatment. Thus, we found no support for the hypothesis that fitness costs associated with low genetic variation increase under more stressful conditions. Our results suggest that natural thermal stress may mask fitness losses associated with low genetic variation in these populations.

AB  - The tunnelling operations connected to the construction of the new Norwegian E39 highway generate a considerable amount of blasted rocks. The local use of these rocks as construction materials in the unbound layers of the highway represents a sustainable cost-benefit application. Two non-traditional stabilizing additives improve the mechanical properties of the aggregates not fulfilling the code strength requirements: one is based on organosilane, the other one is based on lignosulfonate. Laboratory investigations (thin-section microscopy, X-ray crystallography, X-ray fluorescence, repeated load triaxial test) characterize the rock materials and the effectiveness of the additives. The research further investigates the performance of three typical road base layer sections specifically built according to real practice and treated with water (no treatment), organosilane and lignosulfonate, respectively. They are exposed to climatic conditions only; no surface courses and no trafficking actions are applied. The developments of the layers' stiffness and deformation are assessed by means of light weight deflectometer and dynamic cone penetrometer. The time span covered by the investigation is one year, both in the laboratory and in the field. The stabilizing additives can enhance the mechanical properties of the crushed rocks.

AB  - The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is a foundation species with ecosystem engineering functions in the brackish, non-tidal Baltic Sea. In this study from the western Gulf of Finland, the relationship between the spatial patchiness of blue mussels and the diversity of associated macrofauna was examined across small scales (centimeters to meters) for the first time in subtidal habitats. It was demonstrated using geostatistical tools that blue mussel abundance and the diversity of associated macrofauna varied and interacted at 2 depths. Classic analyses (ANOVAs, correlations and multivariate techniques) detected no relationships between the abundance of blue mussels and their associated macrofaunal diversity, or differences in the abundance of mussels or the diversity of associated macrofauna between depths. Using semivariograms, differences in spatial heterogeneity between depths emerged: i.e. patchiness at 5 m and random patterns at 8 m depth. Cross-semivariograms detected negative spatial co-variation between blue mussel abundance and diversity of macrofauna at 5 m, but positive and neutral spatial relationships at 8 m depth. Combining the approaches suggested that high dislodgment of mussels in shallow environments causes this pattern. Dislodgement effects may be compensated for by increased turnover of small mussels in patches within mussel beds, which would result in reduced habitat space for associated macrofauna. On the basis of our results, it is suggested that patchiness of a foundation species is an ecological response, or result of a disturbance, that reduces the diversity of the associated macrofaunal community.

AB  - Based on macroecological data, we test the hypothesis whether European tree species of temperate and boreal distribution maintain their water and nutrient supply in the more arid southern margin of their distribution range by shifting to more fertile soils with higher water storage than in their humid core distribution range (cf. soil compensatory effects). To answer this question, we gathered a large dataset with more than 200,000 plots that we related to summer aridity (SA), derived from WorldClim data, as well as soil available water capacity (AWC) and soil nutrient status, derived from the European soil database. The soil compensatory effects on tree species distribution were tested through generalized additive models. The hypothesis of soil compensatory effects on tree species distribution under limiting aridity was supported in terms of statistical significance and plausibility. Compared to a bioclimatic baseline model, inclusion of soil variables systematically improved the models' goodness of fit. However, the relevance measured as the gain in predictive performance was small, with largest improvements for P. sylvestris, Q. petraea and A. alba. All studied species, except P. sylvestris, preferred high AWC under high SA. For F. sylvatica, P. abies and Q. petraea, the compensatory effect of soil AWC under high SA was even more pronounced on acidic soils. Soil compensatory effects might have decisive implications for tree species redistribution and forest management strategies under anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, soil compensatory effects deserve more intensive investigation, ideally, in studies combining different spatial scales to reduce the uncertainty associated with the precision of soil information.

AB  - Background and Aims Many recent studies emphasize that mixed species is a promising silvicultural option for sustainable ecosystem management under uncertain and risky future environmental conditions. However, compared with monocultures, knowledge of mixed stands is still rather fragmentary. This comprehensive study analysed the most common Central European tree species combinations to determine the extent to which mono-layered species mixing (1) can increase stand productivity and stem diameter growth, (2) increase stand density or growth efficiency, and (3) reduce competition and attenuate the relationship between stand density and stem diameter growth compared with mono-specific stands.
   Methods The study was based on 63 long-term experimental plots in Germany with repeated spatially explicit stand inventories. They covered mono-specific and mixed species stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). Based on spatially explicit measurement, we quantified for each tree the intra- or inter-specific neighbourhood, local stand density and growth. We applied mixed models to analyse how inter-specific neighbourhoods modify stand productivity, stand density, growth efficiency, individual tree growth and the trade-off between individual tree growth and stand productivity.
   Key Results We found stand productivity gains of 7-53 % of mixed versus mono-specific stands continuing over the entire rotation. All mixtures achieved a 3-36 % higher leaf area index until advanced stand age. Stem diameter growth increased by up to 31 % in mixed stands. The growth efficiency of the leaf area was up to 31 % higher, except in mixtures of sessile oak and European beech. The trade-off between stem diameter growth and stand productivity was attenuated by the mixture.
   Conclusions The increased productivity was mainly based on a density increase in the case of Norway spruce/silver fir/European beech and sessile oak/European beech and it was based on a more efficient resource use given the same stand density in the case of Scots pine/European beech and European ash/sycamore maple. In the other species assemblages the increased productivity was based on a combination of density and efficiency increase. We hypothesize that the density effect may be site-invariant and mainly depends on the structural species complementarity. The efficiency increase of growth may depend on the growth-limiting factor that is remedied by mixture and thus be co-determined by the site conditions. For forest management, the results indicate increased stand and tree size growth by species mixing. For the common mixtures examined in this study the results show that thinning for the acceleration of stem growth requires less density reduction and causes less stand growth losses than in monocultures. We discuss the consequences of our findings for silvicultural prescriptions for mixed-species stands.

AB  - An electric road system (ERS) is a transportation solution that provides electricity for fully electric vehicles while in motion. This solution might contribute to sustainable transportation by overcoming range anxiety problems that fully electric vehicles, especially heavy vehicles, have encountered due to battery technology limitations. However, large-scale ERS implementations are challenging, both technically and socially. An ERS is not only an engineering project, but also a complex technology innovation system composed of multiple subsystems and stakeholders, which requires an interdisciplinary means of aligning relations, problems, and solutions. In the policy analysis domain, researchers have developed actor analysis methods to support policy making processes. Actor analysis methods can provide an analytical reflection in solving complex multi-actor policy making challenges that ERSs are also facing. To uncover the complexity of multiple subsystems and stakeholders involved in an ERS, this paper applied a method to align system characteristics with the stakeholders' perceptions to understand multi-stakeholder contexts in complex technology innovation projects. Desk research was first conducted to summarise ERS characteristics. Then, the dynamic actor network analysis method framework was adopted to establish an action, factor, goal (AFG) list, which was revised by independent researchers. Next, the AFG list was used to collect the perceptions of the ERS stakeholders, expressed as AFG selections and causal links through stakeholder interviews. The resulting AFG list was iterated through two rounds of interviews and then validated in a Swedish ERS case workshop. The results from this methodology showed that the actor analysis method can not only be applied to policy analysis domains, but can also be applied to technology innovation complex systems, using the electric road system as a case study, to help uncover the ERS complexity from the concerns of stakeholders and to secure a pathway towards sustainable technology implementation.

AB  - The current Norwegian fisheries management regime has been developed since the early 1970s. With a major goal to obtain sustainability in the fishing industry, the exploitation of most commercial fish stocks are now limited by total allowable catch (TAC) regulations and minimum legal fish sizes for most important species. Additionally, the management strategy includes different approaches to minimise various types of bycatch. Adequate bycatch control is attempted through different management measures such as minimum legal fish size, temporary closure of fishing grounds and a general discard ban. To obtain the desired effects of these regulations, emphasis is put on control and enforcement at sea as well as control of the landings. The increased complexity of different regulatory measures has, however, complicated fishing operations. From the fishermen's point of view, the price of sustainability is therefore, a complicated situation on the fishing grounds, with reduced efficiency and short-term profitability. To minimise this conflict of interests, research on improved size- and species, selectivity of different fishing gears has been emphasised. The work has particularly been focused on improved selectivity of trawl gear, where the bycatch problems have been most pronounced. In addition to codend mesh regulations, the development of sorting grids in different trawl fisheries have been proven to be successful solutions to minimising bycatches of unwanted sizes and species. Sorting grids have also been developed for size grading in various purse seine fisheries. Technical solutions for improved selectivity of stationary fishing gears have also been developed, e.g. different approaches to reduce the bycatch of birds in longline fishing. Technical measures and devices for sorting fish during the capture process have limited value if this induces high mortality on the released organisms. Results from studies of by-mortality related to different bycatch reducing devices are therefore, described and discussed.

AB  - Non-nitrogenous mineral nutrients may be an important constraint on forest productivity and belowground processes in many ecosystems. We measured responses of soil CO2 efflux (FCO2), fine root production, and root-free incubation soil respiration to experimental additions of non-nitrogenous mineral nutrients (phosphorus (P) + potassium (K) fertilizer, dolomitic lime, and P + K plus lime) over 2 years in a sugar-maple-dominated forest in central Ontario; this region receives some of the highest anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs in North America, and evidence exists for co-limitation by P, magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) of the growth of dominant trees. Soil amendments, in particular P + K fertilization, reduced FCO2, fine root production and microbial respiration, with decreases in FCO2 of 28-51% in fertilized compared to control plots. Partial regression analyses indicated that soil available P had a negative effect on FCO2, fine root production, and microbial respiration, but detected no significant effects of N, Ca, or Mg. Path analysis further suggested that available P reduced both fine root production and microbial respiration, and that these effects were largely responsible for reduced FCO2. There was also a residual direct negative relationship between available P and FCO2, which may represent reduced metabolic activity of roots. The study indicates that P is a critical nutrient dominating belowground processes in an N-saturated forest ecosystem, and suggests that additions of P may enhance C sink strength in managed forests in part through reductions in soil CO2 efflux.

AB  - New decentralized energy-generation technologies have turned economies of scale upside down while becoming more economically viable. At the same time, the increased penetration of information technologies has led to new opportunities to manage infrastructure in a less hierarchical, more flexible way. Together with citizen demands for control over energy, these two converging trends has put energy communities (ECs) on the agenda, potentially advancing the transition towards more sustainable energy systems, despite hindrances encountered on the way. This paper presents a case study of the planning process of a sustainable city district in Sweden, using participatory observations and interviews conducted with included stakeholders. We analyse how the included stakeholders has reasoned about establishing a sustainable energy system in the area, including a microgrid. The discussions on a microgrid comprised two parallel discourses, coexisting but seldomly explicitly confronted. The distribution system operator in the area promoted a distributed energy system (DES) solution, while the property developers opted for a microgrid organized more as a citizen energy community (CEC). We discuss why the CEC proponents so far has lost the battle of creating a community owned smart grid. We conclude that the different models, a DES and a CEC, comprise different values and an increased focus on energy communities could shift the transition pathway towards a more decentralized system involving other prioritise than just economical.

AB  - This article employs ethnographic material from Sweden and Estonia to examine the relationship between religion and the love of nature in Northern Europe - a region known for its widespread secularisation. We propose that the existential depth that is often ascribed to nature experiences in this part of the world points to a facet of the secularisation process, indicating that love of nature among today's Northern Europeans is deeply entangled with the processes of modernisation. The article provides a historical analysis of how this phenomenon arose and explores ways of approaching it that move beyond the religious-secular dichotomy. It concludes by construing love of nature as belonging to an 'existential field' in the Northern European cultural landscape.

TI  - The transformation of childhood: Children and families in postwar Norway
T2  - ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA  - English
AB  - The title 'Transformation of Childhood' relates to the structural and cultural changes in childhood and families in the period following the Second World War. Modern childhood is closely related to the evolution of the post-industrial educational society. This has permeated both family life and the culture in general, transforming the landscape of childhood through the creation of a new family structure, daycare systems, organized leisure activities, and extensive schooling. At the core of these changes in family patterns, as well as the changes in the ideology of parenting and family policies in Scandinavia, is the educational level of parents, especially mothers. Another factor is the ideology of equality between the sexes, and the changing structure of modern professional life. The 1990s period sees girls being more successful than boys during the years of mandatory schooling, and being dominant among students in higher education. They also appear to hold a stronger position in the child culture in general, and in relation to the predominant youth scenes. This development is rooted partly in the structure of modern childhood, providing fertile ground for social and cultural innovation. Through generational exchange, the childhood of one historical period influences the family patterns of the next one, restructuring the childhood of the next generation of children.

AB  - Information derived from a historical infield cadastral map dated 1874 and its written protocol was combined with data on four landscape characteristics (distance to the hamlet, 1 slope, folded aspect and quaternary geology) in a GIS-based 3D model in an attempt to develop a methodology for reconstructing earlier tilled field patterns. The study area was the farm of Grinde in Western Norway. The areas that the farmers themselves considered to be best for growing crops in 1874 sloped gently, faced south-west, were close to the hamlet and were on glacio-fluvial deposits or a thick layer of moraine. More than 80% of the fields expected to be the oldest appeared to be correctly identified. This pilot study shows that it is possible to identify the probable location of the oldest tilled fields both on maps and in the terrain, using land consolidation documents or other data on crop sowing and yields from historical sources even where no land consolidation documents are available. The method may be helpful in determining areas that should be managed or protected in specific ways to maintain the value of the cultural landscape.

AB  - The algal record from Lake Ringsjon covers a period of more than 100 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, the lake had a well-functioning commercial fishery, when a brownish mess began to appear in the water, clogging-up the fishing nets and making fishing difficult. This was the first record of algal problems in the lake. Following complaints from the fishermen, the algal flora was investigated and the mess was stated to be a mass development of diatoms belonging to the genus Melosira ( Aulacoseira). Diatom maxima then appeared regularly in spring and autumn, whereas blue-green algae only occurred occasionally and in low abundances. Between 1900 and 1950, nutrient concentrations slowly increased in the lake. Algal blooms of Anabaena lemmermannii and Gloeotrichia echinulata began to appear in summer. Between 1960 and 1980, the lake developed into a hypertrophic status with extensive blooms of blue-green algae from May to October, including high biomasses of mainly Microcystis spp. This severe pollution started with increased usage of the lake, increased tourism and recreation, intensified farming with the introduction of artificial fertilization, and also the diversion of sewage water from a sewage treatment plant. In 1968, cattle death was reported and in 1981, algal toxicity was verified by mouse bioassay. After a period of extremely poor water quality, the lake began to show signs of improvement as a result of the nutrient and fish reduction programmes. The very heavy blooms of blue-green algae decreased and the duration of blooms became shorter. The Microcystis species were to a certain extent replaced by Anabaena and Aphanizomenon species, and biodiversity of algae increased. With respect to the algal community, the lake has improved considerably, but is still eutrophic and suffers summer blooms of toxic blue-green algae.

AB  - Concern has been voiced in recent years regarding the environmental implications of the Antarctic krill fishery. Attention has focused primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects, including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use associated with extracting krill is relatively low compared to that of other reduction fisheries. Results of this study provide insight into the broader environmental implications of the krill fishery, comparisons between products derived from krill and other species targeted for reduction, opportunities for improving the fishery's performance, and a baseline against which to measure future performance.

AB  - Sustainability transition demands fundamental changes taking place at the farm system level. At the same time, many farms are operating on the verge of financial profitability, especially in geographically disadvantaged peripheral regions with a limited range of production opportu-nities. These observations raise concerns about the transition's justice aspects. Using the concept of resilience, we analysed farmers' capacities for transformation in a peripheral context in Finland. The results from our farmer survey (n = 577) indicated that the regime exerts a strong cost-price squeeze on farmers, escaping of which is difficult also for farmers deliberately seeking new pathways beyond it. Due to farmers' dependence on the regime, drastic changes to 'the rules of the game' could undermine their resilience. We argue that for transition processes to be both sustainable and just, proactive restorative justice should aim at promoting resilience at the farm level by deliberately building inclusive and accessible transition pathways.

AB  - Pollen assemblages from moss polsters from northwest Scotland are compared with the vegetation composition around the sampling points. Presence-absence data are used to calculate association, over- and under-representation indices for the relationship between plants and the pollen assemblages, and results are found to be broadly comparable with published results from Norway. Relevant pollen source areas for individual taxa are estimated using least-squares linear regression analysis of pollen percentage against distance-weighted plant abundance. The extended R-value model is applied to estimate the relevant pollen source area for the pollen assemblages. The results indicate relevant pollen source areas on the order of 2 m or less for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium type, Myrica gale, Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Potentilla type and Succisa pratensis. Changes in non-arboreal components of pollen assemblages from mire communities therefore appear to reflect predominantly local patch dynamics rather than wider landscape changes.

AB  - The payment of a compensation as a response to damage to livestock is a measure used by policy-makers to attenuate severe human-wildlife conflicts, which allows that economic burden to be shared with the rest of society. This study focuses on the case of wolf depredation on livestock in the county of Viana do Castelo, located in the north of Portugal. Wolf attacks are frequent in the county, which results in a high expenditure with the current compensation scheme for livestock owners. Nevertheless, illegal killing of wolves continues to occur in the area. The paper aims to evaluate the attitudes of the general public, livestock owners and hunters towards the existing compensation scheme and the presence of wolves in Viana do Castelo. In addition, it analyzes the implications of the results for the management of damage caused by wolves in the county.

AB  - Climate change and air pollution are among the key drivers of energy transition worldwide. The adoption of renewable resources can act as a peacemaker and give stability regarding the damaging effects of fossil fuels challenging public health as well as the tension made between countries in global prices of oil and gas. Understanding the potential and capabilities to produce renewable energy resources is a crucial pre-requisite for countries to utilize them and to scale up clean and stable sources of electricity generation. This paper presents a hybrid methodology that combines the data envelopment analysis (DEA) Window model, and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) in order to evaluate the capabilities of 42 countries in terms of renewable energy production potential. Based on three inputs (population, total energy consumption, and total renewable energy capacity) and two outputs (gross domestic product and total energy production), DEA window analysis chose the list of potential countries, including Norway, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Australia, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, United States, Japan, Colombia, and Italy. Following that, the FTOPSIS model pointed out the top three countries (United States, Japan, and Australia) that have the greatest capabilities in producing renewable energies based on five main criteria, which are available resources, energy security, technological infrastructure, economic stability, and social acceptance. This paper aims to offer an evaluation method for countries to understand their potential of renewable energy production in designing stimulus packages for a cleaner energy future, thereby accelerating sustainable development.

AB  - Bark stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) is one of the most acute instances of damage wrought by these animals in a forest. Because of its location, bark stripping causes damage to the thickest and most valuable part of the tree trunk, which lowers the quality of the wood due to technical flaws. The research was conducted in 25 sampling sites of pine stands aged 35 years in a mixed, fresh forest habitat in south-western Poland. The study was aimed at assessing the influence of bark damage by deer on biometric parameters of pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.). The assessment involved the diameter at breast height, height, basal area and volume of the tree stands. The results revealed a strong deer-specific pressure on the analysed pine stands. The share of bark stripped trees ranged from 65% to 96%. The number of bark damage instances (NBDI) on a given tree was found to significantly affect its diameter at breast height. The strip-damaged trees had breast height diameters lower by 23% on average, and their mean height was lower by 8.7% as compared with the trees without damage. The mean reduction in basal area increments (G(1.3)) of the trees was identified at 39%. In a similar way to the diameter at breast height and the basal area, the losses in tree stand volume growth caused by deer stripping were significant and oscillated at 41%.

AB  - In the European Alps, Rhododendron ferrugineum grows in silicate regions while Rhododendron hirsutum is restricted to limestone areas. At geologically mixed sites, also hybrids (Rhododendron x intermedium) can occur. We hypothesised that hydraulic properties would vary with the species' habitat requirements. Key hydraulic parameters (vulnerability to drought-induced embolism, stomata regulation) and related wood characteristics as well as diurnal courses of water potential (I) and stomatal conductance were analysed on plants growing on a silicate, a limestone and a geologically mixed site. Highest embolism resistance[I at 50% loss of conductivity (I (50)), -3.24 +/- A 0.18 MPa] and the highest safety margin between the I at stomata closure (I (SC) at 10% of maximal leaf conductance) and I (50) were observed in R. hirsutum at the limestone site (1.57 MPa). Like in R. ferrugineum, hydraulic parameters indicated less resistance at the geologically mixed site. Highest I (50) (-1.95 +/- A 0.12 MPa), corresponding to wide conduits and a reduced conduit wall reinforcement, was found in R. x intermedium. Diurnal courses indicated a rapid stomata closure in response to low I in R. hirsutum and R. x intermedium. The plasticity in drought adaptation of R. hirsutum corresponds to its ability to colonise dry limestone areas. In contrast, hydraulic limitations of R. x intermedium may explain restrictions to rather moist sites. This study provides insight into the role of xylem hydraulics and stomata regulation in shrub water relations, interspecific and site-specific differences in drought adaptation, as well as effects of hybridisation on plant hydraulics.

AB  - A lack of ecological responses in stream restoration projects has been prevalent throughout recent literature with many studies reporting insufficient time for recovery. We assessed the relative importance of time, site variables, and landscape setting for understanding how plant species richness and understory productivity recover over time in riparian zones of northern Swedish streams. We used a space-for-time substitution consisting of 13 stream reaches restored 5-25 years ago, as well as five unrestored channelized reference reaches. We inventoried the riparian zone for all vascular plant species along 60-m study reaches and quantified cover and biomass in plots. We found that while species richness increased with time, understory biomass decreased. Forbs made up the majority of the species added, while the biomass of graminoids decreased the most over time, suggesting that the reduced dominance of graminoids favored less productive forbs. Species richness and density patterns could be attributed to dispersal limitation, with anemochorous species being more associated with time after restoration than hydrochorous, zoochorous, or vegetatively reproducing species. Using multiple linear regression, we found that time along with riparian slope and riparian buffer width (e.g., distance to logging activities) explained the most variability in species richness, but that variability in total understory biomass was explained primarily by time. The plant community composition of restored reaches differed from that of channelized references, but the difference did not increase over time. Rather, different time categories had different successional trajectories that seemed to converge on a unique climax community for that time period. Given our results, timelines for achieving species richness objectives should be extended to 25 years or longer if recovery is defined as a saturation of the accumulation of species over time. Other recommendations include making riparian slopes as gentle as possible given the landscape context and expanding riparian buffer width for restoration to have as much impact as possible.

AB  - This study explores managerial learning from social capital during internationalization. Its two research questions are these: (1) how different managers perceive, interpret, and respond to foreign-market institutions, and (2) how connections, relations, and cognition enhance managerial learning. Using an interpretive approach, the study analyzes patterns of internationalization and strategic decision-making in four contrasting Norwegian case companies that internationalize to the Russian oil and gas market. The findings show that the managers of the case companies hold similar perceptions about foreign-market institutions, but that they interpret and respond to those institutions from various levels of learning, resulting in different enactment on institutions. Managers learning at a "higher" level adapt patterns and decisions to ensure institutional conformity, while those at a "lower" level makes minor adjustments in patterns and behavior only when necessary and therefore maintain institutional conflict. Further, the findings show that all three dimensions of social capital have a vital role in enhancing managerial learning, but that the various forms that the dimensions can appear as, affects the learning process. Furthermore, the findings show that managers who share cognitive frame of reference with few embedded relationships are better equipped to interpret and respond to institutions. This study contributes fresh insight about managerial enactment on foreign-market institutions, and reconciles our understanding about social capital as embraced by the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions. This study also contributes to a greater understanding about how the three dimensions of social capital ought to be formed to enhance managerial learning.

AB  - Systems integration (the combination of previously independent systems) is one of the solutions proposed by industrial ecology scholars to tackle environmental problems. Systems integration has not yet been analysed as an innovation process, which could bring additional insights to its challenges and barriers. This paper is a first attempt to fill this gap.
   Using a conceptual model based on actor-network theory and insights from structuration theory, we analyse the case of developing sewage gas for transport in Stockholm. Results show that the process was very dynamic and that the network grew in such a way that it became risky for actors not to join it. Moreover, pre-existing socio-technical rules had to be re-negotiated during the process. The process through which types of pre-existing rules were modified was unique for each pre-existing network that was involved. Besides, in one instance systems integration required the development of a bridging network allowing interaction between initially independent networks for sewage and private transport. Finally, results also show that systems integration requires a "superstructure" i.e. an organisation that can coordinate activities and take important risks to see to it that systems integration gets realised.

   This paper aims to identify improvements and gaps in the specific EU regulations for organic farming and whether they promote higher welfare standards for dairy cattle compared to the "minimum standards" set up for conventional farming. Based on the available scientific evidence, we identified areas in the organic regulations where the welfare status of the animals is improved, but some limitations and gaps exist.
   Animal welfare is an emerging concept in EU law; with the advent of specific regulations intending to protect animals. The approach taken by European lawmakers is to provide "minimum standards" for conventional farming; argued by some as failing to adequately protect animals. In contrast, the EU organic farming regulations aim to "establish a sustainable management system for agriculture" and promote "high animal welfare standards". The first aim of this review was to identify key areas where there are clear improvements in quality of life for dairy cattle housed under the EU organic regulations when compared to the conventional EU regulations. Using the available scientific evidence, our second aim was to identify areas where the organic regulations fail to provide clear guidance in their pursuit to promote high standards of dairy cattle welfare. The greater emphasis placed on natural living conditions, the ban of some (but unfortunately not all) physical mutilations combined with clearer recommendations regarding housing conditions potentially position the organic dairy industry to achieve high standards of welfare. However, improvements in some sections are needed given that the regulations are often conveyed using vague language, provide exceptions or remain silent on some aspects. This review provides a critical reflection of some of these key areas related to on-farm aspects. To a lesser extent, post farm gate aspects are also discussed

AB  - In a 20-year follow-up the association between alcohol consumption, social and personal background factors and mortality was studied in a cohort of 49 464 Swedish conscripts.  The relative risk of death among high consumers (those consuming more than 250 g alcohol/week at conscription) was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.2-3.7) compared with moderate consumers (1-100 g/week).  Deaths caused by direct toxic effects of alcohol were few, less than 5%.  Instead suicides and accidents predominated.  Abstainers had a slightly lower mortality than moderate consumers, with a relative risk of 0.8 (0.6-1.1), due to a significantly lower risk for traffic deaths.  High consumers of alcohol had more than twice as many social and personal risk factors for premature death compared with the cohort as a whole.  Yet presence of social risk factors added little to the already increased relative risk of death among high consumers.

AB  - This research paper fills a literature gap by tapping into Europe???s Just Transition to green energy production and consumption models and introduces empirically derived trends. The mix of analysed variables was targeted at sustainable energy transformation models according to complementary economic research areas. Based on the clustered heat maps method, double dendrograms were constructed to identify socioeconomic and environmental patterns that characterize highly economic-efficient and sustainable transition patterns from the standard energy production and consumption model to the environmental-friendly and cost-efficient model in the European area. Results show that Austria, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, and Luxembourg followed the patterns of highly economically performant European countries that turned energy and resource productivity in their favour based on multiple factors: recycling, R&D, innovation, digitization. The opposite was observed in the case of many South-Eastern European countries. Robustness checks were performed based on the linear discriminant analysis methodology and results confirmed that Northern European countries lead the change to a more sustainable future. In this context, this research brings empirical results for decision-makers and aims to facilitate a better understanding for adapting policies according to national needs, as well as to the patterns of success identified in the case of European leaders.

AB  - Introduction: There are currently many changes taking place in the aviation system affecting the work of air traffic controllers (ATCOs), and thus it was considered important to assess work-related demands and stress responses among ATCOs. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of burnout among ATCOs compared with other professions; to examine the relationship between job demands, job resources, and burnout; and to examine if burnout could predict both work- and health-related outcomes. Method: The participants were 209 Norwegian ATCOs and data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to 500 ATCOs. The study was part of a national survey of both health care and non-health care professions. Results: ATCOs did not score high on burnout compared with the three comparisons groups (police, journalists, and building constructors); in fact, ATCOs scored significantly lower on exhaustion compared with journalists (Hedges g = 65) and building constructors (Hedges g = 63), and not significantly different from police officers. Both job demands and job resources were related to burnout; work conflict especially was an important predictor for all of the three burnout dimensions. Burnout predicted psychosomatic complaints (r(2) = 0.48), satisfaction with life (r(2) = 0.25), and other work outcomes. Discussion: The overall level of burnout was not high among ATCOs compared with other professions, which may be related to selection procedures for the profession. Burnout was related to important outcome variables such as psychosomatic complaints and attitudes toward work.

AB  - Interactions between grey seal, Atlantic salmon, and harvest controls on the salmon fishery in the Gulf of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, were investigated for the period 1999-2003. We assessed the effects of seal-induced catch losses (fish damaged or eaten by seals in the fishing gears) and harvest restrictions (delayed sequential opening of the fishery from south to north) on the Finnish coastal salmon catch and on escapement of salmon into the Tornionjoki River, the major breeding ground of the species in the Baltic Sea. Commercial logbook data on catches and seal-induced catch losses were used in a stochastic Monte Carlo analysis, indicating that mainly because of the stricter harvest controls enforced in 1996 and 1997, the average annual spawning run abundance that approached the Finnish coastal area increased by ca. 56700 fish between 2000 and 2002. However, these fish were caught increasingly in the northern Gulf of Bothnia (Management Areas, MAs, 3 and 4), and relatively few salmon escaped into the Tornionjoki River. The landings in MAs 3 and 4 increased by 57% and 144%, respectively, whereas in the southern Gulf of Bothnia (MA 1), landings decreased by 23%. Over the five years of the study, seal-induced catch losses in MA 1 ranged from 24% to 29% of the total catch, whereas in MAs 2, 3, and 4 it ranged from 3% to 16%. The analysis suggests, however, that in MA 1 the regulation-induced catch losses were even higher than seal-induced catch losses, indicating that the salmon fishery was being impacted by both major factors. To increase escapement into the river and potentially to increase the future wild salmon catch, the opening of the harvest in the northernmost MAs should be delayed. Seal-induced catch losses should be reduced by extensive introduction of seal-safe fishing gears and by sustainable control of the grey seal population.

AB  - This article examines program development in teacher education, with an emphasis on how teacher educators pursue coherence. The analysis contributes to existing literature by investigating how coherence is pursued as part of program development and by analytically situating coherence as an emergent achievement that requires the alignment of program design with institutional practices. The empirical data derive from four Norwegian teacher education institutions that were redesigning their programs in response to expectations of increased program coherence. Cultural historical theory and the concept of institutional coherence are used to examine how coherence is pursued at the intersection of institutional practices and emergent developmental processes. The findings highlight how institutional practices inform program development, requiring program leaders to navigate complex organisational, epistemic and political landscapes in their efforts toward coherence. Implications for the conceptualisation of coherence and for program leadership in teacher education are discussed.

AB  - Aims: First, to describe the rationale for developing a combined summary score, the Healthy and Sustainable Dietary and Physical Activity habits (HSDPA) score, incorporating four selected dietary and physical activity aspects: (a) the New Nordic Diet, (b) local and sustainable foods, (c) active transportation and (d) non-exercise outdoor activities. Secondly, to describe the experiences from constructing the HSDPA score. Methods: Relevant literature covering the four aspects of interest was reviewed to secure a well-grounded rationale and a theory-based approach. To measure compliance with such a broad approach targeting diet, physical activity, health and environmental sustainability, the HSDPA score was constructed including one subscale for each aspect. The four subscales were constructed from questionnaire items and were equally weighted, entailing a range from 0-10 points, hence the total HSDPA score ranged from 0-40 points. Results: In retrospect, we believe that the rationale for creating the HSDPA score is reasonable. Still, emphasizing fewer, but the most relevant aspects, such as reduced meat consumption and active transportation, may represent a more functional solution than the broad approach suggested herein, both for promoting public health and environmental sustainability, and for developing a feasible measurement tool. Conclusions: Our experiences illustrate the importance of methodological perspectives and scrutiny related to both the development and testing of complex summary scores. Nevertheless, we think that combined summary scores could be applicable for use within epidemiological studies and for measuring the effects of interventions, if accounting for the methodological limitations as far as possible.

AB  - Studies on the distribution of scleractinian corals in the Bay of Biscay were relatively numerous during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century. Yet, recent reports are scattered, sometimes unpublished, and therefore knowledge about the current coral occurrence in the area is limited. This study aims at compiling the available historical and more recently collected information on the occurrence of scleractinian corals in the Bay of Biscay. Data from two recent cruises are included and compared with previous explored coral sites from as early as 1830 up to 1995. A database of 347 records including 34 described species of scleractinians highlights that the slope of the Bay of Biscay is an important habitat for scleractinians. This could be expected due to the high topographic relief providing the necessary hard substrate and accelerated bottom current flow that corals require. Further exploration of the occurrence and ecology of corals in the area is recommended to support the conservation of cold-water coral reefs along the European margin.

AB  - Livestock depredation is an important source of conflict for many terrestrial large carnivore species. Understanding the foraging behavior of large carnivores on domestic prey is therefore important for both mitigating conflict and conserving threatened carnivore populations. Handling time is an important, albeit often overlooked, component of predatory behavior, as it directly influences access to food biomass, which can affect predator foraging efficiency and subsequent kill rates. We used long-term data on snow leopards (Panthera uncia) in Mongolia (Asia) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Norway (Europe) to examine how large carnivore foraging patterns varied between domestic and wild prey, and how the different landscape characteristics affected those patterns. Our results suggest handling time was generally shorter for domestic compared to wild prey. For snow leopards, rugged terrain was linked to increased handling time for larger prey. For lynx, handling time increased with terrain ruggedness for domestic, but not wild, prey, and was greater in closed compared to open habitats. There were also other differences in snow leopard and lynx foraging behavior, e.g., snow leopards also stayed longer at, and remained closer to, their kill sites than lynx. Shorter handling time suggests that felids may have utilized domestic prey less effectively than wild prey, i.e., they spent less time consuming their prey. This could a) result in an energetic or fitness cost related to decreased felid foraging efficiency caused by the risk of anthropogenic disturbance, or b) exacerbate conflict if reduced handling time associated with easy prey results in increased livestock depredation.

AB  - Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are managed by the 5 nations where they occur (Canada, Greenland/Denmark, Norway, Russia, United States) using discrete subpopulations. In Canada, polar bears are harvested throughout their range, and several subpopulations are managed by more than one jurisdiction; therefore, recent management focused on ensuring sustainable polar bear harvests. Consequently, the subpopulation from which harvested bears are removed and the geographic boundaries of that subpopulation must be correctly identified. However, boundaries of the Southern Hudson Bay (SH) subpopulation have not been verified using satellite radio-telemetry data. Sea ice duration has already declined in Hudson Bay and James Bay, and both the duration and distribution of sea ice are predicted to decline greatly in the next century; therefore, it is important to document current habitat use patterns to assess the potential impacts of climate change. We used a probabilistic approach to describe the utilization distribution for the SH subpopulation based on data from 1997-2003 from 26 adult female bears fitted with satellite collars and assessed whether the currently accepted boundaries represent the population utilization distribution. We conclude that the SH boundaries do reflect the current spatial distribution of adult female bears in this subpopulation. Our analysis provides a benchmark to compare to the future distribution and habitat use of this subpopulation in response to effects of climate change and identifies future research needs to investigate polar bear distribution in James Bay and in the area near the boundary between the SH and Western Hudson Bay management zones.

AB  - The aim of this article is to argue for the relevance of critical visual literacy (CVL) in relation to intercultural learning in ELT and present a redesign task that has been implemented with secondary school EFL learners in Norway. CVL is an approach to reading images which acknowledges that all texts are constructed, rather than neutral, and that they work to position the reader to accept a particular view of the world. Redesign tasks encourage learners to engage critically with these positions and create alternative texts that better reflect their personal worldviews. Through presenting examples of learner redesigns of a multimodal advertisement created in a different cultural context, we discuss how the task facilitated critical reading, exploration of multiple perspectives and engagement with sociopolitical issues. Such critical reading skills are crucial for navigating the increasingly more complex visual and intercultural landscapes the learners encounter in their everyday lives.

TI  - When 'development' devastates: donor discourses, access to HIV/AIDS treatment in Africa and rethinking the landscape of development

KW  - POST
KW  - AIDS
AB  - If globalisation is the mighty tremor shaking the landscape of the 'project of development', then, in certain regions of the world, HIV/AIDS is surely its epicentre. Nonetheless, for all the burden of the disease, Western donor policy on HIV/AIDS still remains largely silent about the provision of anti-retroviral treatment. This paper seeks explanations for this pervasive medical neglect and donor preference for prevention programmes over treatment. The postcolonial approach taken in the paper is to regard donor policy on HIV/AIDS - as illustrated by the UK's Department for International Development and the Norwegian Agency for Development Co-operation - as cultural and political exchanges framed by prevailing representations of Africa. The different 'logics' which skew policies towards prevention are identified. For donors and African states alike, HIV/AIDS policies - like development interventions more generally would benefit immensely by foregrounding the human right to health, including, critically, promoting treatment within a genuine 'prevention - care - treatment' policy continuum.

AB  - The deep-water coral Lophelia pertusa provides habitat for diverse communities in the Gulf of Mexico. Photomosaics and analyses within a Geographic Information System (GIS) were used as non-destructive sampling tools to examine megafauna community composition associated with L. pertusa colonies on authigenic carbonate outcrops in two regions of the Gulf of Mexico. Megafauna communities associated with L pertusa were more similar within a region than between regions. Within regions, the amount of dead coral, number of abiotic and biotic substrata, and percentage of live L pertusa influenced the diversity, composition, and structure of the coral-associated communities. Elevated diversity levels in the communities associated with L percusa structure indicate that L. pertusa provides a distinct, localized habitat source. Outcrops with high proportions of dead L pertusa harbored more higher order consumers than outcrops with primarily live coral framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article seeks to contribute to a discussion concerning the concept of socio-cultural identity in geographical science. The main aim is to describe how people living in the Slovak self-governing regions define their identity. Which identity is the most important for them? How proud are they of their self-governing regions? Slovakia consists of several types of regions of the sub-national level. Regional/local identity is a phenomenon where people identify themselves with the social system of a certain region with its folks, culture, traditions, landscape, etc. Theory of institutionalization of regions by Finnish geographer Paasi provides us a useful framework for understanding how regions and regional identity emergence, and are continually reproduced and transformed in and through the practice of individuals and institutions at a variety of spatial levels. The results of the survey indicate the regional disparities of so-called soft factors of the social identity development in self-governing regions (inhabitants, relationship to the territory of a municipality, local pride, etc.). In addition, we discuss the need for a comprehensive approach linking together ethnography, geographical and sociological methods.
   In regard of ongoing modernization and acquisition of new political, sociocultural and economic models of life, there is a regression of tradition, customs and norms in Slovak society which have been dominating in society for the last decades. Within the identity research in Slovak society, the model based on empirical research of territorial identity is sketched. Territorial identity is defined as the dimensional and relational phenomenon, based on cultural, regional, national-religious and neighbourhood-local concept of society. The paper should offer solutions related to the relationship between the dimension of territorial identity and dimensions of basic relational concepts of society.
   Collective memory and its social relations are determined by cultural and historical traditions, which have been formed under the influence of economic and political processes in a particular region. The strength of social and cultural identity (traditions) ultimately depends on the process of the historical acceptance place by its folks.

AB  - The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is an invasive species and a serious pest of rice in many Asian countries. We studied predatory activities of various animals living in Japanese freshwater habitats, by keeping each individual of a potential predator species with 36 snails of various sizes for three days in the aquarium. Forty-six species were tested, and 26 in eight classes fed on small snails. A species of leech, crabs, the common carp, turtles, the mallard duck and the Norway rat attacked even adult snails of 20-30 mm in shell height. These findings will be helpful in identifying effective predators for biological control of the pest snail. In addition, most of the animals attacking snails are reported to be common in rivers or ponds, but few live in modernized paddy fields having little connections with natural water systems. This may be a reason why this snail maintains large populations in paddy fields but not in other freshwater habitats.

AB  - Sustainable forest management has to consider the long-term effects of climate change on species growth to develop adaptation measures. In this perspective, dendrochronology provides valuable information on climate-growth relationships over long time periods. Tree-ring analyses in mixed stands can elucidate how different species respond to climate change within the same environmental conditions. However, few studies have investigated such stands, especially in South-Eastern Europe. In the forest reserve of Lom, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we had the opportunity to study three co-occurring species (silver fir, Norway spruce, European beech) in an old-growth forest characterized by reduced human and natural disturbances, and a climate favourable to the tree species. We evaluated tree growth response to climate on inter-annual and decadal time scales over about 250 years. Response to inter-annual climate variability changed over the study period. Climate signal in beech was generally low, with a negative correlation to April temperature in the last decades. In fir and spruce, the positive effect of current year's spring temperature decreased, while the negative effect of the previous summer temperature considerably increased over the last century. At the decadal scale, different responses have been detected among species: spruce was mostly negatively affected by summer temperature whereas summer precipitation benefited fir growth, probably balancing high evapotranspiration. Beech showed a peculiar delayed response, and protracted drought periods led to severe growth reductions. Despite a temperature increase over the last three decades, fir did not experience any growth reduction, while a strong decline was evident in spruce and beech productivity. Mesic sites are commonly underrepresented in tree-ring research. In our analysis, covering about 250 years, we observed that climate also affects species-specific growth patterns in these areas. Within a global change perspective, specific divergent responses are likely to occur even where current environmental conditions appear to be not limiting for tree species. Future management strategies should consider these outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The marketability of fish depends on the visual appearance of the fish, so the feed ingredient pigment contributes to the nutritional value and visual appearance of the product. The benefits of a natural pigment derived from microalgae are the ecological benefits, as the culture can fix carbon and release oxygen. The economic aspect is a benefit of synthetic pigments. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was used to determine the environmental impact of natural and synthetic pigments. The results obtained from the LCA are expressed according to the impact categories defined by the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR). A sensitivity analysis was also carried out comparing the environmental impacts of electricity generated with hydropower or using a field mix from Norway for the natural pigment. The total single score value for natural pigment is 1.17E+01 mPt and the largest impact is from sodium nitrate and electricity. The sensitivity analysis results for electricity from the country mix is 1.82E+01 mPt. The total single score value for synthetic pigment is 8.24E-01 mPt, with the largest impact from methanol. Synthetic pigments have a lower environmental impact than natural pigments, but a sensitivity analysis shows that the environmental impact can be reduced by choosing an alternative to electricity. It should be noted that the comparison presented represents a general comparison of alternatives, as the input data is derived from a literature review.

AB  - 1. Increasing population sizes of geese are the cause of numerous agricultural conflicts in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Scaring is often used as a tool to chase geese away from fields, either as a means to protect vulnerable crops or as part of goose management schemes to drive geese to accommodation areas. Geese are quick to habituate to stationary scaring devices; hence, active scaring by humans is often employed. However, it remains undocumented how much effort is required for active scaring to be effective.
   2. We explored the relationship between intensity of active human scaring on field use and behaviour by geese. Using an experimental framework, we applied four different scaring doses per day (geese were scared either 2, 5, 7 or 10 times per day), to random pastures in a pink-footed goose spring staging area in mid-Norway, and recorded goose flock sizes, fleeing response distances, and average weekly goose densities assessed by dropping densities. In addition, we counted droppings in fields without scaring. We used mixed models to test for changes in the effects of different scaring doses over time and compared observed with predicted dropping levels.
   3. Cumulative dropping densities increased at different rates depending on the scaring dose. Scaring dosage did not affect flock size and fleeing response distance during the study period, but both flock sizes and fleeing response distances changed with time.
   4. Scaring dose 2 did not show any decrease in relative goose use compared to the fields without scaring, whereas doses 5, 7 and 10 all showed 74-78% fewer droppings by the end of the spring staging period, indicating a possible threshold between dose 2 and 5. The largest effect of scaring appeared during the first week of scaring.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study is the first to show a dose-response relationship between active scaring and field use of flocking geese. For individual farmers, the study provides guidance on the level of scaring effort needed to be cost-effective. If implemented as part of a management scheme with subsidy/accommodation areas in combination with systematic and persistent scaring, it can be used as a tool to keep geese away from areas where they are not wanted, thereby assisting in the alleviation of goose-agriculture conflicts. The approach in this study can be adapted and used in a wider range of wildlife interactions with human economic interests.

AB  - A methodology for local stakeholders' involvement in water management using a catchment model as a platform for dialogue has been developed and tested in the Kaggebo Bay drainage area in the southeast of Sweden. The process involved farmers, rural households not connected to municipal wastewater treatment facilities, local and regional authorities as well as different water and agricultural experts. This paper aims to assess whether and how the methodology has succeeded in encouraging social learning and promoting action and which barriers can be identified. The assessment shows that the methodology is able to create confidence in the process and increase the willingness to act as the methodology was able to adapt the form and content of the dialogue to better fit the cognitive and relational needs of involved stakeholders. It is also shown that the process may lead to a probable improvement of the eutrophication situation. However, if these types of processes are to serve not only as a basis for social learning and action at the local level, but also as the basis for a broader process of societal learning, then a mechanism to confer local ideas to the regional and national levels has to be clarified.

T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English

AB  - A simple numerical model was applied to distinguish permanently oxygenated marine sill basins from periodically anoxic basins in Nordland County, northern Norway. Input data are sill depth, width of the tidal channel, sea surface area, and tidal range. The model produces a Topography Tidal Factor (TTF) that seems to be an adequate index correlating with empirical field data when sills have saddle depths < 30 m. The depth of the pycnocline, and the oxygen concentration of the basin water increases logarithmically with the calculated TTF value toward an asymptotic level. At TTF >= 0.02 basins are mostly well-oxygenated and have a permanent fauna of epibenthic and hyperbenthic animals. Basins with TTF < 0.02 may become anoxic each autumn, which permanently prevents establishment of communities with multiannual sessile benthos. Low oxygen concentration may also cause seasonal variation in the occurrence of motile species. In tidal channels, the abundance of bivalves and fish, as well as the biodiversity in general, probably increases with TTF. The applied method may be universally valid in regions shaped by glacial erosion but needs to be further developed by more detailed studies.

T2  - FOREST SCENARIO MODELLING FOR ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT AT LANDSCAPE LEVEL
LA  - English
CP  - International Seminar and Summer School on Forest Scenario Modelling for Ecosystem Management at Landscape Level
AB  - Possible climate change can cause changes in the forest growth rate (FGR), however, it is not the only factor of FGR changes. Two estimates of site indices H50 as stand height predictions at the reference age of 50 years were calculated for each forest stand, one on the basis of forest inventory data of 1951 (H50(1951)) and the other one of 1994 (H50,,,) using a difference equation of stand height depending on stand age, main species and site factors. The difference equation of height for Estonian state forests was elaborated on the basis of the set of single records of forest inventory data per each of 511 514 stands described in 1984-1993. Using the new dynamic data set (2 records per stand with time interval 43 years), the change in site index from 1951 to 1994 (difference H50(1994) - H50(1951)) was calculated and used as dependent variable to indicate and to analyse the actual change in forest growth.
   On the basis of 10514 sub-compartment data records, an average increase of 2.1 meters of site index H50 was calculated, as well as a remarkably high standard deviation of 3.6 meters. Increase in site index depends on many factors, mostly on drainage, main species, change of stand generation and forest district. Average increase of site index H50 was 2.1 meters for pine stands, 1.4 meters for spruce stands and 2.5 meters for birch stands.
   For optimal adaptation strategy analysis to FGR changes MELA-JLP model was used. MELA software is developed in the Finnish Forest Research Institute and the first experimental versions appeared in the mid-1970s. The system has been used since 1994 in Lithuania and since 1995 in Estonia.
   The problem of the optimal adaptation for analysing consequences of possible climate change in forestry is redefined for MELA system as a change of FGR. A representative sample of 4000 stands was tested with six different growth rates. A simulation period of 60 years was chosen; from 1997 to 2057. The constraints of non-decreasing timber removal and non-decreasing total volume were applied to fulfil sustainability requirements of forestry. The structure of timber production potential was analysed.
   As the average timber production in Estonia in 1997-2057 with current forest growth rate is 8.53 mill. m(3), changing from 6.10 mill. m(3) to 11.39 mill. m3 with tree growth rate from 75% to 125%. With higher forest growth rate more forest management alternatives were generated, i.e. the higher forest growth causes more complicated and diverse forest management decisions.

AB  - Social-ecological (SE) traps refer to persistent mismatches between the responses of people, or organisms, and their social and ecological conditions that are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Until now, the occurrence of SE traps is primarily explained from a lack of adaptive capacity; not much attention is paid to other causal factors. In our article, we address this concern by theorizing the variety of human responses to SE traps and the effect of these responses on trap dynamics. Besides (adaptive) capacities, we theorize desires, abilities and opportunities as important additional drivers to explain the diversity of human responses to traps. Using these theoretical concepts, we construct a typology of human responses to SE traps, and illustrate its empirical relevance with three cases of SE traps: Swedish Baltic Sea fishery; amaXhosa rural livelihoods; and Pamir smallholder farming. We conclude with a discussion of how attention to the diversity in human response to SE traps may inform future academic research and planned interventions to prevent or dissolve SE traps.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the importance of trade-offs between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and creating a holistic, integrated approach. Design/methodology/approach This study uses secondary data including official reports from three companies: Accor Hotels, Scandic Hotels and Atlantica Hotels. Third party references from research sources are included. Findings This study concludes that companies are adopting corporate social responsibility practices focussed on stakeholders' needs. Additionally, the general trend in the case study hotel companies is towards similar sustainability approaches though less progress is reported in addressing the more complex issues relating to SDG 8 and SDG 10 because sustainability targets are more difficult to determine, implement and measure. Originality/value The three selected companies were chosen based on location criteria. Accor has a worldwide presence whereas the other two companies could be considered as multinational companies. Scandic is a Swedish company operating in Scandinavian countries whereas Atlantica is a Cyprus-based company operating in Greece and Egypt. The contrast among the selected companies displays different considerations regarding their commitment to SDGs.

AB  - This study examines an elementary school which during enrolment in the European Network of Health Promoting Schools, 1993-2003, and the Norwegian Physical Activity and Healthy Meals Project, 2004-2006, selected physical activity (PA) as a prioritized area. Survey data, school documents, and focus group data were collected and analyzed through a sequential exploratory strategy. After a decade, the students in the upper grades participated in more PA weekly than allocated by national plans, and PA promotion was formalized in curriculum outlines. The findings suggest that motivated teachers were the core of PA promotion. Teacher motivation was linked to an interplay between individual teacher characteristics: positive attitudes, innovativeness, internalization of practice, and teacher skills; and organizational characteristics: leadership, teacher climate, and working strategies. The study highlights the advantages of utilizing a mixed-methods approach to data collection and data analyses. The findings could only be reached by an integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, yielding a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the conditions facilitating sustainability of PA promotion in schools as well as other types of policy initiatives.

AB  - Green roofs can be valuable components in sustainable urban drainage systems, and hydrological models may provide useful information about the runoff from green roofs for planning purposes. Various models have been proposed in the literature, but so far no papers have compared the performance of multiple models across multiple full-size green roofs. This paper compared 4 models: the conceptual models Urbis and SWMM and the physically-based models Hydrus-1D and Mike SHE, across two field sites (Lyon, France and Umea, Sweden) and two calibration periods for each site. The uncertainty and accuracy of model predictions were dependent on the selected calibration site and period. Overall model predictions from the simple conceptual model Urbis were least accurate and most uncertain; predictions from SWMM and Mike SHE were jointly the best in terms of raw percentage observations covered by their flow prediction intervals, but the uncertainty in the predictions in SWMM was smaller. However, predictions from Hydrus were more accurate in terms of how well the observations conformed to probabilistic flow predictions. Mike SHE performed best in terms of total runoff volume. In Urbis, SWMM and Hydrus uncertainty in model predictions was almost completely driven by random uncertainty, while parametric uncertainty played a significant role in Mike SHE. Parameter identifiability and most likely parameter values determined with the DREAM Bayesian algorithm were found to be inconsistent across calibration periods in all models, raising questions about the generalizability of model applications. Calibration periods where rainfall retention was highly variable between events were more informative for parameter values in all models.

AB  - The urgency of climate change means that low-carbon transitions are needed in large socio-technical systems such as energy and transportation. These transitions must be rapid, but also fair. An emerging body of evidence suggests that users have important roles in transitions, yet much previous research has examined user involvement while assuming it to be largely a positive force. This goes against a growing amount of evidence within sociotechnical studies that highlight the potentially obstructive or negative role that users may play in transitions and innovation. In this study, we pose a critical question: In what ways may users perpetuate injustices within a transition? To answer this question, we provide conceptual background on energy justice and user adoption of low-carbon energy and mobility technologies. We then analyse users and energy injustices in three low-carbon transitions - solar energy in Germany, electric vehicles in Norway, and smart meters in Great Britain - based on empirical data from interviews, focus groups, and internet forums. Our main contribution is to show how users in low-carbon transitions are not always positively engaged, or even neutral, but can introduce and contribute to inequality and exclusion.

AB  - Along with increasing significance of innovation in socio-economic development grows the need to utilize future-oriented knowledge in innovation policy-making. Foresight and road-map exercises are aimed at supporting planning and priority-setting of R&D and have become indispensable elements of policy-making. Besides technological development decision-makers need all-inclusive knowledge of future developments of society. economy and impacts of science and technology. When the worldwide competition is about the attractiveness of innovation systems, such knowledge is important for comparing the innovation performance of nations to other economies. Finland is among the countries improving her position in worldwide performance comparisons since the late 1990s and reached leading nations in early 2000s. This attainment raised national interest and critical debate of the reliability of the data basis and methodologies used in comparisons. In The Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers (TEK) this discussion led to a decision to develop an own comparative exercise together with VTT. in addition to performance analysis based on ex-post indicators the barometer includes the questionnaire of the views and visions of the future development by relevant national actors. The theoretical framework of the barometer is based on the evolution of economies from industrial development phase to sustainable knowledge society. The barometer has been undertaken in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and a wide interest and emerged discussion of barometer proves that a social interest and order exists for the barometer. The article presents the background. methodology and results of technology barometer. discusses its impacts on national discussion, and gives perspectives for the future development of barometer.

AB  - Neighbor interactions are likely to play an important role in subarctic plant communities. We conducted experiments in Interior Alaska in which we crossed species removal with greenhouse warming manipulations. We examined changes in community biomass, and in plant survival and growth of individual species in response to experimental warming and to: (1) removal of whole species versus an equivalent amount of biomass across many species, and (2) removal of subdominant (locally common) versus minor (locally uncommon) plants. Community biomass indicated compensation in growth after removal of minor species and after biomass removal without elimination of entire species, but under-compensation after removal of subdominants. Growth and survival of individual species showed facilitation between some species. Warming increased growth of dominant vascular plants, but at the same time reduced survival, and these impacts were greater for larger, more mesic species than for the smaller species associated with drier habitats. Growth of mosses was reduced by the warming. Removal effects did not differ between warming and ambient conditions. The results indicate that common species are able to reduce resources for others (competitive effect) and increase their growth after neighbor removal, whereas locally uncommon species are not able to respond rapidly to increased resources made available by neighbor removal. Therefore, the impact of the presence of common species on locally uncommon species was facilitative overall, but not vice versa. The balance between disturbances such as changes in temperature and species losses from the community will likely be crucial in determining shifts in subsequent community composition.

AB  - Alarming amounts of microplastics have recently been shown to accumulate in the environment. Recent focus has been on synthetic material contaminating the marine environment, while effects on freshwater habitats and organisms have received less attention. We here confirm and analyse occurrence of microplastics in the duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, in a Swedish river. All analysed mussels contained microplastics, and the number of microplastic debris found in the mussels increased with mussel size. In addition, we demonstrate higher concentrations of microplastics downstream urban areas with wastewater treatment plants compared to a rural upstream location. Both fibres and particles were found in the mussels, indicating that the emissions of these pollutants may have varying origin. Our study indicates that microplastics can be suspended in the water column in streams and that concentrations are higher downstream anthropogenic activity. We discuss our results in light of potential pathways in rural versus surrounding arable land, and highlight a number of required research directions in the aquatic system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A population of the alvar race of the perennial herb, Silene uniflora (Caryophyllaceae), which grows on thin soils in open alvar habitats on the Baltic island of Gland, SE Sweden, was found to have an extended and more or less bimodal flowering phenology. Large individuals produced flowers during both periods, while small, and presumably young, individuals only produced flowers in either of the two periods, or in part of both. In the early flowering period plants were heavily infested by the seed-predatory larvae of a noctuid moth, Hadena confusa, but in the late flowering period only a small proportion of the fruits was attacked by the seed predators. The proportion of flowers developing into fruits was consistently high throughout the season. Both the number of seeds per capsule and the mass of seeds decreased over the flowering season. However, the germination success of early and late seeds did not differ. Thus, although differing in number of seeds, both early and late flowers contributed to individual reproductive success. Large individuals started to flower early in the season and despite their high loss of seeds in the early part of the summer they contributed a larger number of seeds to the seed pool than smaller and later-flowering individuals. Although selection was acting to favour later flowering during a year with high early seed predation, consistency of date of flower initiation and of relative predation impact on individuals across years was low, suggesting that recurrent selection by seed predators is weak. Seed predation, although heavy, is therefore judged to be unlikely to cause a significant evolutionary response on flowering phenology in this plant.

AB  - Biotechnology can provide innovative and efficient tools to support sustainable development of aquaculture. It is generally accepted that use of the term 'genetically modified' causes controversy and conflict among consumers, but little is known about how using the term 'biotechnology' as a salient feature on product packaging affects consumer preferences. In an online discrete choice experiment consisting of two treatments, a set of 1005 randomly chosen Swedish consumers were surveyed about use of hormone and triploidization sterilization techniques for salmonids. The information given to the treatment group included an additional sentence stating that the triploidization technique is an application of biotechnology, while the control group received the same text but without reference to biotechnology. Analysis using a hierarchical Bayes approach revealed significant consumer reactions to the term biotechnology. When the term was included in information, variation in consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates increased significantly. Moreover, some participants were dissuaded towards an option guaranteeing no biotechnological intervention in production of fish. These results have multiple implications for research and for the food industry. For research, they indicate the importance of examining the distribution of variation in WTP estimates for more complete characterization of the effects of information on consumer behavior. For the food industry, they show that associating food with biotechnology creates more variability in demand. Initiatives should be introduced to reduce the confusion associated with the term biotechnology among consumers.

AB  - Geochemical reference levels are necessary preliminary steps for appropriate environmental legislation, especially in the assessment of management of soil pollution and protection measures. The problem of establishing reference levels in areas with variable basic geology and anthropogenic pressure is addressed by characterising the geochemistry of 82 representative samples of the geologic materials of the Congost River basin (NE Iberia). The samples have been grouped in a system of 12 operative geochemical units comprising the entire area of the basin. The 'total' and 'partial' concentrations of 54 chemical elements have been determined. The geochemical variability has been discussed by means of statistical methodologies, diagrams and GIS techniques. The analysed samples reveal that the composition of the Congost catchment is highly varied. The differences between the 'total' and 'partial' concentrations define complex patterns reflecting the mineralogy of samples. The results indicate that bedrock geology is the most important factor influencing the major and trace element distributions in the basin. Pb and Zn were observed to be enriched in units more exposed to pollution than their parent materials. In general, the defined operative geologic units are characterised by different major and trace element compositional ranges as a consequence of their lithological diversity. The fact that the samples have been linked to a system of regional geological units allows the geochemical comparison of materials from the Congost River basin with other reference materials from neighbouring areas, or worldwide. For such an approach, we have focused on the geochemistry of the Pleistocene detritic sediments. We close the study by proposing that a good way of expressing the geographic distribution of the geochemical variability of a region could be to apply geologic extrapolation of three representative statistics, an average value (the 50th percentile), a low value (the 25th percentile) and a high value (the 75th percentile). As an example, we present the Th maps, which permit the clear discussion of the Th distribution in the basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In intensive agricultural systems, efficient nutrient use is necessary for high crop yields as well as for sustainable environmental management. Recent studies in temperate regions indicate that non-exchangeable NH4+-N (NEA), which is fixed in clay minerals, may affect crop productivity and soil N dynamics more than previously thought. To estimate the quantity and plant availability of NEA in Swedish soils, ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown in a pot experiment using 18 soils that were collected (0-20 cm depth) from two long-term agricultural experiment series at five locations. Initial NEA, total N and soil K contents were measured, as well as NEA content 56, 112 and 168 days after planting of ryegrass. The results show that the soils (0-20 cm) contained 21-217 mg NEA kg(-1) sieved soil (5 - 300 kg NEA ha(-1)) estimated as corresponding to 0.1 - 5.1% of the total soil N. Long-term application of farmyard manure (FYM) did not increase contents of soil NEA. Long-term application of K fertilizer increased soil contents of AL-extractable K, but there was no significant correlation with NEA content. Concurrent with ryegrass growth, NEA content decreased on average by 16% between day 0 and day 112, indicating that NEA was released from the soil and taken up by the plants.

AB  - Renewable power sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal are considered sustainable and environmentally sound alternatives to fossil fuels. There is a lack of a reliable multidimensional index to assess renewable energy adoption across the world. We aimed to develop a new index to assess the transition to renewable sources in different countries. Variables were reviewed for suitability for inclusion in the index. Three metrics were selected: renewable energy output, consumption of renewable energy, and electricity production from renewable sources. These were used to compile the Renewable Energy Index (REI). Analysis showed that REI ranged from zero to 69.5 (mean 23.1) across 142 countries. Nations such as Denmark, Norway and New Zealand were ranked high while oil-dependent countries had a lower index value. The REI is a novel measure of adoption of renewable energy sources in countries across the world. It has the potential to be used in economic analyses and planning for sustainable development. The Index may be useful in comparing countries and regions in order to encourage investment in renewable energy production.

AB  - Dry deep mixing (DDM) is a soil stabilization method widely used in countries with large soft clay areas, such as in the Nordic countries. In Finland, DDM is performed using a binder material that commonly consists of cement and lime in a 50:50 or 30:70 ratio. However, both lime and cement generate large amounts of emissions of carbon dioxide, which has led to a shift toward alternative materials in recent years. This paper presents the results of an extensive testing program where samples of Finnish sensitive soft clay are stabilized with eight different low emissions binders and tested by means of the uniaxial compression strength test. The alternative binders comprise different by-products and/or pozzolanas in varied percentages, which include lime kiln dust (LKD), biomass-based fly ash from bioenergy production, gypsum, blast furnace slag, as well as lime and cement in reduced amounts. The tests were performed on samples stabilized at different binder densities (60, 70,100,120, 140, and 160 kg/m3) and after 28 days of curing to determine the optimum densities for DDM design purposes. The results showed that binders such as blast furnace cement, the cement-quicklime-gypsum (33:33:33), and the LKD-cement (50:50) exhibited higher strength than the traditional lime/cement binders at different binder densities. In addition to these results, a simplified CO2 emissions calculation procedure is proposed for a DDM design supporting a road embankment, and two different emissions factors are obtained for the investigated binders. The results showed that some alternative binders can provide high binding efficiency with low CO2 emissions.

AB  - Purpose By relying on a sustainable career perspective and recent studies on senior employees' late career phase, this study aims to examine senior (50+) nurses' late career narratives in the context of extending retirement age. Given the current global nursing shortage, there is a pressing need to find ways on how to promote longer and sustainable careers in the health-care field. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extended late career phase of senior nurses. Design/methodology/approach Empirical data were derived from 22 interviews collected among senior (50+) nursing professionals working in a Finnish university hospital. The qualitative interview data were analysed using a narrative analysis method. As a result of the narrative analysis, four career narratives were constructed. Findings The findings demonstrated that senior nurses' late career narratives differed in terms of late career aspirations, constraints, mobility and active agency of one's own career. The identified career narratives indicate that the building blocks of sustainable late careers in the context of extending retirement age are diverse. Research limitations/implications The qualitative interview data were restricted to senior nurses working in one university hospital. Interviews were conducted on site and some nurses were called away leaving some of the interviews shorter than expected. Practical implications To support sustainable late careers requires that attention be based on the whole career ecosystem covering individual, organizational and societal aspects and how they are intertwined together. Originality/value So far, few studies have investigated the extended late career phase of senior employees in the context of a changing career landscape.

AB  - Assessing regional trends in groundwater quality can be a difficult task. Data are often scattered in space and time, and the inertia of groundwater systems can create natural, seemingly persistent changes in concentration that are difficult to separate from anthropogenic trends. Here, we show how statistical methods and software for joint analysis of multiple time series can be integrated into a roadmap for trend analysis and critical examination of data quality. Ordinary and partial Mann-Kendall (MK) tests for monotonic trends and semiparametric smoothers for multiple time series constitute the cornerstones of our procedure. The MK tests include a simple and easily implemented method to correct for serial dependence, and the associated software is designed to enable convenient handling of numerous data series and to accommodate covariates and nondetects. The semiparametric smoothers are intended to facilitate detection of synchronous changes in a network of stations. A study of Swedish groundwater quality data revealed true upward trends in acid-neutralizing capacity and downward trends in sulfate but also a misleading shift in alkalinity level that would have been difficult to detect if the time series had been analyzed separately.

AB  - Community assembly is an integral process in all ecosystems, producing patterns of species distributions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. Environmental filters and colonization history govern the assembly process, but their relative importance varies depending on the study system. Dead wood decomposition is a slow process, allowing decomposer communities to develop within a slowly changing substrate for decades. Despite this, there are few long-term studies of priority effects from colonization history in this ecosystem. In this study, we investigate the importance of insects in early succession of dead wood on the fungal community present one decade later. Sixty aspen trees were killed in two study landscapes, each tree producing one aspen high stump and log. Insects were sampled with flight interception traps during the first 4years after tree death, and fungal fruiting bodies were registered in year twelve. We found positive priority effects of two fungivorous beetles, the sap beetle Glischrochilus quadripunctatus and the round fungus beetle Agathidium nigripenne, on the Artist's bracket (Ganoderma applanatum) and a positive priority effect of wood-boring beetles on the ascomycete Yellow fairy cup (Bisporella citrina). The Aspen bracket (Phellinus tremulae) did not respond to insects in early succession of the dead wood. Our results suggest that early successional insects can have significant, long-lasting effects on the late successional fungal community in dead wood. Also, the effect can be specific, with one fungus species depending on one or a few fungivorous beetle species. This has implications for decomposition and biodiversity in dead wood, as loss of early colonizing beetles may also affect the successional pathways they seem to initiate.

AB  - The mixing of freshwater and seawater where rivers flows into the salty ocean releases large amounts of energy. This energy can be harvested and made into electricity using pressure retarded osmosis (PRO). This is the concept of osmotic power, a new and yet unexploited source of renewable energy. The idea of exploiting the energy from mixing fresh water and sea water with PRO was first developed by Prof. Sidney Loeb in the early seventies. After some years in the eighties with limited progress in the field, the Norwegian power company Statkraft engaged in technology development in the mid nineties aiming at cost-effective osmotic power production. Today Statkraft is the world leader in development of osmotic power, and have made state of the art achievements during the last few years. The work has been focused on the design and production of a semi-permeable membrane optimized for osmotic power. During these years the power density of the membrane has increased from less than 0,1 W/m(2) up to today's membranes producing close to 3 W/m2. The target of 5 W/m2 necessary to produce osmotic power on commercial basis seems within a few years time. The development has consisted of testing existing membranes, and improving these, as well as designing completely new membranes. An insight to this work will be given, and also give some results from the testing of existing and novel membranes operated in PRO. The world's first osmosis driven power plant will be put into operation during 2009 in the southeast of Norway. The main objectives of the prototype are twofold. Firstly, confirming that the designed system can produce power on a reliable 24-h/d production. Secondly the plant will be used for further testing of technology achieved from parallel research activities to substantially increase the efficiency. These activities will mainly be focused on membrane modules, pretreatment of water, pressure exchanger equipment and power generation (turbine and generator). The presentation will give a brief introduction to the prototype system, the expectations for operation and maintenance, and also some outline of the next steps in the development of osmotic power. The paper gives a general overview of the obstacles that needs to be addressed, and expectations of the results that should be achieved. With these assumptions handled, osmotic power can develop into a new, renewable source of energy well capable of competing on the energy market in the near future. Once again, Prof. Sidney Loeb contributes to solve one of the major challenges to establish a sustainable world for the next generations.

AB  - Ireland with its resource of wind has the potential to use this natural resource and sustain the country's power needs for the future. However, one of the biggest drawbacks to renewable energy generation, particularly wind-generated electricity is that it is an intermittent and a variable source of power. Even at the "best" sites wind varies dramatically from hour to hour and minute to minute. This leads to two main problems:
   1) When the wind drops below a lower limit or goes above a higher limit the turbine can shut down and electricity is not produced.
   2) Energy is not stored when there is an excess of electricity generated on site.
   Because of these problems wind power has a very low capacity credit and backup power is needed to handle the large fluctuation of production.
   This paper introduces the current energy system in Ireland and the targets that Irish operators are to achieve in the next decade. A review of energy storage options for Ireland is outlined including the use of hydrogen and fuel cell technology. It is concluded that a project similar to the Norwegian Utsira wind/hydrogen project could be piloted in Ireland and a site similar to Dundalk Institute of Technology could be used to demonstrate and test the system. Going forward to achieve high levels of renewable energy generation, similar distributed wind/hydrogen hybrid systems could reduce the need for curtailment of wind farms, save wasted energy, reduce backup power, reduce transmission losses, generate large revenue by selling power at peak times, ensure security of supply and reduce the need for costly interconnects to Europe.

AB  - The paper aimed to analyze income inequality in the EU-27 countries in the period 2014-2021 based on Eurostat data and methodology involving specific indicators. Dynamic analysis, regression equations, R-2, growth or decline rates, classifications, comparisons, and graphical and tabled illustration of the results were the main procedures for data processing. In the most member states it was noticed a reduction of disparities, grace to the measures taken by each country to improve income of the citizens by social transfers. In the Euro area, income level is higher than in EU-27 and income disparities are smaller. In 2021, the EU-27 median disposable income accounted for Euro 18,369 by +21.6% higher than in 2014. In the Euro area, it reached Euro 20,776 (+19.4%). The highest median disposable income exceeds Euro 25,000 in Luxemburg, Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Germany, while the lowest level is in Romania Euro 4,832. In 2021, Gini coefficient of equalized disposable income was 30.1 in the EU-27 and 30.5 in the Euro area, showing a slight decline of income inequality. While Lithuania and Latvia are the countries with the highest income disparity, Slovenia, Belgium and Czechia have a lower income inequality. Income by quantiles reached Euro 12,790 in the EU-27 and Euro 14,622 in the Euro area. Luxemburg, Ireland, Austria and Netherlands registered the highest income by quantiles, while Latvia, Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania the lowest one. Income quintile share ratio S80/S20 for disposable income, reached 4.97 in the EU-27 and 5.02 in the Euro area. It increased in France, Italy, Latvia, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands and declined in all the other countries. Despite of a relative reduction in income inequality during the analyzed period, the process has to continue for ensuring the goal 10 of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development. For this reason, researchers and policy makers have to look for new strategies to improve income and increase the living standard of the population and assure the sustainable development of all the member states.

AB  - The origin of species is a central topic in biology. Ecological speciation might be a driver in adaptive radiation, providing a framework for understanding mechanisms, level, and rate of diversification. The Arctic charrSalvelinus alpinusL. is a polymorphic species with huge morphological and life-history diversity in Holarctic water systems. We studied adaptive radiation of Arctic charr in the 460-m-deep Lake Tinnsjoen to (a) document eco-morphology and life-history traits of morphs, (b) estimate reproductive isolation of morphs, and (c) illuminate Holarctic phylogeography and lineages colonizing Lake Tinnsjoen. We compared Lake Tinnsjoen with four Norwegian outgroup populations. Four field-assigned morphs were identified in Lake Tinnsjoen: the planktivore morph in all habitats except deep profundal, the dwarf morph in shallow-moderate profundal, the piscivore morph mainly in shallow-moderate profundal, and a new undescribed abyssal morph in the deep profundal. Morphs displayed extensive life-history variation in age and size. A moderate-to-high concordance was observed among morphs and four genetic clusters from microsatellites. mtDNA suggested two minor endemic clades in Lake Tinnsjoen originating from one widespread colonizing clade in the Holarctic. All morphs were genetically differentiated at microsatellites (F-ST: 0.12-0.20), associated with different mtDNA clade frequencies. Analyses of outgroup lakes implied colonization from a river below Lake Tinnsjoen. Our findings suggest postglacial adaptive radiation of one colonizing mtDNA lineage with niche specialization along a depth-temperature-productivity-pressure gradient. Concordance between reproductive isolation and habitats of morphs implies ecological speciation as a mechanism. Particularly novel is the extensive morph diversification with depth into the often unexplored deepwater profundal habitat, suggesting we may have systematically underestimated biodiversity in lakes. In a biological conservation framework, it is imperative to protect endemic below-species-level biodiversity, particularly so since within-species variation comprises an extremely important component of the generally low total biodiversity observed in the northern freshwater systems.

AB  - To move towards a more sustainable and circular economy, a more efficient recovery processes for end-of-life vehicles and their constituent components and materials is needed. To enable reuse, remanu-facturing, high-value recycling and other circular strategies, a well-functioning disassembly is essential. This article presents a literature review of studies focusing on vehicle dismantling and surrounding end-of-life treatment systems. Furthermore, topics considered as the most critical for practitioners were identified through focus groups composed of industry representatives and researchers from various Swedish organizations. By comparing findings from the literature and empirical results, it is concluded that there are differences and gaps between the areas researched and those considered as important by industry, thus calling for further research to address practical challenges in improving vehicle end-of-life management. The four areas highlighted as the most prominent are: i) plastics, ii) batteries, iii) in-vestments and ownership structures, and iv) the workforce.

AB  - The paper discusses different strategies for the disposal of wastewater sludge, particularly the "use on land" strategy and the "productification" strategy. In the fuse on land" strategy the new regulations in Europe call for stabilization as well as disinfection of sludge to be used on land. The paper discusses the design and operation experiences with stabilization/disinfection methods in Norway where such treatment has been compulsory since 1995. In the "productification" strategy it is differentiated between the production of "bio-soils" and production of specific products (energy, nutrients, coagulants etc) and the marketability" of these products is evaluated. An example of a sludge treatment concept aimed at recycling - the KREPRO process - is presented.

AB  - Many second home owners demand rights, benefits, and influence in their host community, and the article examines how second home owners in pursuit of their interests can gain acceptance among local residents. The analysis is based on interviews with local residents in four rural Norwegian second home municipalities. The findings show that local residents' attitudes towards second home owners' pursuit of their own interests in the host community depend to a large degree upon the residents' perceptions of the outcome of second home tourism in their municipality. Local residents can tolerate second home owners' demands as long as the second home owners satisfy some of the community's significant economic-material or social needs. When second home owners make demands while their presence does not bring any evident benefits to the host community they are perceived as trying to take without giving. Based on these findings, the author argues that it is not second home owners' (objective) otherness from locals that is the main problem in cases of a conflictual climate between the two parties. Rather, it is the local structural context that constitutes the main problem if it does not make it possible for second home owners to contribute to the host community.

AB  - CONTEXT: Diversified cropping systems are a main pillar of agroecological practices, but their development is hindered by technological lock-in of agri-food systems around a few major crops. There are only a few examples where minor crops successfully developed and stabilized in a given agricultural region. The underlying change processes at play in these situations are not well known.OBJECTIVE: Our paper draws on successful crop diversification experiences, and more specifically on analyses of why and how farms change towards diversified cropping systems, with a view to identifying levers to further enable crop diversification.METHODS: We selected three regions in Europe (Vende acute accent e in France, Marche in Italy and Skane in Sweden) where minor crops are present and carried out interviews on 33 farms where these crops had recently been introduced. The interviews aimed at retracing the farms' crop diversification pathways and the drivers thereof. Farmers were asked to explain their motivations for diversifying their crops and the resources they mobilized to do so. Using a combination of variables to describe the evolution of crop diversity and farmers' behavior towards diversification crops, we statistically categorized the crop diversification pathways into three distinct patterns.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The three types of crop diversification pathways identified differed in the following respects: their crop diversity evolution dynamics; the levels of crop diversity reached; and the nature of the change processes that supported them. Type 1 farmers diversify slowly, based on crop-by-crop comparisons of performances. They mobilize few external resources. Type 2 farmers steadily increase crop diversity by introducing a few minor crops on large areas. They are driven by combined economic and agronomic or work related motivations, and supported by the downstream actors buying the crops. Type 3 farmers diversify rapidly and significantly, driven by agronomic motivations on the benefits of crop diversity for the crop succession. They look for leeway and flexibility in their decisions by mobilizing a variety of outlets and networks.SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first time that crop diversification is analyzed as a long-term (ten to twenty years) change process on farms, with a comparative analysis of three contrasting European regions. Our results indicate that support to crop diversification should be tailored according to farmers' agronomic, economic and work related issues-especially at the level of the crop succession and the farm. Outlets for diversification crops need to be thought out in terms of the level of external support and autonomy they provide to farmers.

   2. Adult resource density, but not patch size or larval food plant abundance, influenced the numbers and the fractions of residents, emigrants, and immigrants.
   3. Differences between species were observed in movement frequency and maximum distances moved but not in mean distances moved.
   4. The scarce copper showed much greater movement ability than expected from the results of published studies. This is believed to be a result of the comparatively large size of the study area and the high cover of suitable habitat (>50%).
   5. The mean and maximum distances travelled by butterflies reflected differences in the size of the study area.

AB  - Wild ungulates are a major consumer of agricultural crops in human dominated landscapes. Across Europe, ungulate populations are leading to intensified human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, ungulates play a vital role in the structuring and functioning of ecosystems, and are highly appreciated for recreational hunting. Thus, managers often face the challenge of maintaining the benefits of having thriving ungulate populations while simultaneously minimizing their negative impacts. Broadcasting playbacks of predator vocalizations (e.g. dogs barking, wolves howling or humans talking) could potentially be used to induce fear and thereby displace or steer behavior of ungulates from conflict-prone sites resulting in reduced visitation and foraging time and consumption. Predator playback experiments in wilderness areas have repeatedly demonstrated to reduce the preys ' resource use and impacts on the surrounding landscape, but this has not been tested in agricultural fields where human-ungulate conflicts are most pronounced. We responded to this need by conducting a predator playback experiment in multiple crop fields in southern Sweden, where multiple ungulate species (fallow deer, roe deer, red deer, moose, wild boar) coexist, using a novel integrated camera trap - speaker system (ABRs) that broadcasts sounds of choice when a camera is triggered by an ungulate. Predator playbacks (wolf, dog, human) reduced deer patch use and crop damage on wheat fields more than playbacks of control sounds (owl, goose, raven). Our results confirm findings from previous studies in wilderness areas, and demonstrate that broadcasting predator playbacks using ABRs may provide an effective tool to reduce crop damage at the scale and duration of our study.

AB  - This paper deals with the challenging task of permanently organizing projects that include a broad range of actors: enterprises, social movement organizations and state actors. It focuses on a special type of standardization activity, namely eco-labelling, and is based on case studies of two Swedish projects/organizations: labelling of organic food and sustainable forestry. In this paper, I theorize about the concept of inclusiveness, which is seen as being instrumental for the creation of regulatory credibility and authority and argue that different types of members/participants have different types of power resources, which the standardization organization (SO) seeks to mobilize and control. The combination of these individual power resources brings action capacity and symbolic resources to the SO, including an image of independence. Moreover, the SO provides an organizational setting that, inter alias, helps interdependent actors to maintain a hold on each other, and forces them to engage in a dialogue and repeated interaction over time. This interaction can, in turn, result in common expectations and understandings that are essential for the operations of non-state governance. However, the case studies also indicate difficulties in organizing such complex networks. It can, above all, be difficult to prevent a power shift in favour of organizations with large power resources.

AB  - A previously presented objective method to calculate each species sensitivity to disturbance is here slightly modified and implemented in the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) for marine benthic invertebrates. A framework for assessment of water bodies based on multi-site BQI-values is also presented, where a certain variation of BQI-values is allowed to cover the heterogeneity within each water body. The 20th percentile, using bootstrapping, from the available sites' BQI-values is compared with the status boundaries for quality assessment. The reliability of the assessment depends on the background information available for the boundary setting as well as the number of sampling sites included in the assessment. Agreement between time series of quality assessments in areas with known changes in anthropogenic disturbances is encouraging. Problems associated with water body assessment based on few or no samples, as well as multiple sampling occasions during the 6-yr WFD cycle are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Local pollen deposition in human-influenced vegetation types is studied with the aim of establishing the relationship between arable-weed vegetation and its pollen representation as an aid in interpreting human presence and impact on vegetation from pollen assemblages. The study area is located in the Franche-Comte region, eastern part of France.
   The presence of plants within 100 m 2 plots and their pollen representation in moss samples within the same plots was recorded from different crops and annual fallows. Patterns in the vegetation and pollen assemblages were investigated separately using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Procrustean co-inertia analysis (PCIA) was then used to test whether two configurations of sites in the PCoA plots were similar to one another. The relationship between plant and pollen presences was quantified using association, over- and under-representation indices. Each taxon was related to its mode of pollination and characteristics of the flowers, as well as to the size of its pollen grain.
   Six groups of releves are defined on the basis of species composition (arable-weed flora of acid or basic soil, etc.). PCIA analyses revealed that the general patterns found in the vegetation data are the same with different levels of determination (species or pollen types). On the other hand, the numerical analyses of the modem pollen data-set not allow us to distinguish all the groups. Only the first one (of acid soil) can be distinguished from the others (with few differences nevertheless).
   The patterns found with the representation indices are explained by flower characteristics (mode of pollination, etc.), which all have an important influence on their pollen production and dispersal properties. The discrepancies found between the two data-sets (vegetation and modem pollen assemblages) may be explained by these characteristics (pollen production, dispersal and preservation of individual taxa as well as by land-use practices).
   If the identification of our groups of vegetation releves from their pollen assemblages is not possible, we can nevertheless identify pollen indicators of arable areas classically found in northern countries (Cerealia, Centaurea cyanus, Polygonum aviculare-Type, Fallopia, etc.) and some others which seem to be present rather in more southern countries (Papaver rhoeas Group, Sinapis, Kickxia, Scleranthus, Euphorbia and Valerianella).

AB  - Currently nickel producers are keeping a close eye on both the economic and production developments taking place at the Talvivaara open pit mines and their bio-heap-leach operations located in Finland. The concept of open pit mining combined with heap leaching is a popular concept in the copper industry and practiced on oxidised copper ore bodies with less than 1% Cu. In general, this process consumes large quantities of sulphuric acid when based on oxide mineralogy. Talvivaara is processing very low-grade, but complex Ni, Zn, Cu sulphide ore (0.27% Ni, 0.57% Zn and 0.14% Cu). Its full contained metal value at 70% base metal recovery is estimated at 40-50 USD/MT ore using long-term metal prices (all elements). Low-grade complex disseminated nickel sulphide ore bodies are fairly abundant worldwide, but in general not yet economically treatable through the conventional mine-mill-smelter route.
   In the Sudbury basin of Ontario there is a vast resource of similar to 0.8% Ni-bearing pyrrhotite tailings, which has been disposed of separately in shallow lakes since the early 1990s in compliance with known environmental and sustainable development standards. The estimated full contained metal value at 70% nickel recovery from pyrrhotite is estimated at 90-100 USD/MT using the same long-term metal prices as for Talvivaara. Supply of sulphuric acid is abundant from nickel smelter operations in the basin. There are, in addition, many other low-grade ore bodies where nickel-bearing pyrrhotite, with or without pentlandite exsolution flames, is readily available. This commercial context raises the question whether Ni-bearing pyrrhotite can be considered a sustainable resource.
   In this paper some historical context behind pyrrhotite processing in the Sudbury area is provided. Flow sheet design considerations based on both technical and economic factors are reviewed with the objective of providing the nickel industry with tools for informed decision-making on the possibilities for exploitation of this low-grade nickel sulphide raw material.

AB  - Publicly funded demonstration projects represent a critical intermediate step between basic R&D on the one hand, and large-scale commercialization of new sustainable technology on the other. However, these projects often suffer from various technical and nontechnical difficulties, frequently fail to meet objectives, and sometimes stall despite the best intentions of their facilitators. This paper reports on a multiple case study of 21 demonstration projects in the area of sustainable technology set in Sweden and offers two contributions. First, it maps the project-internal and external factors that allow or prohibit demonstration projects to reach their goals. Second, it suggests a process model outlining the key activities for setting up a new demonstration project. By doing so, the paper provides important implications for the process of developing and commercializing sustainable technologies. The escalating environmental crisis in particular underscores the need for new knowledge about how cleaner and more sustainable technologies can be applied. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Eco-acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to map biodiversity across large scales, yet little thought is given to the privacy concerns and potential scientific value of inadvertently recorded human speech. Automated speech detection is possible using voice activity detection (VAD) models, but it is not clear how well these perform in diverse natural soundscapes. In this study we present the first evaluation of VAD models for anonymization of eco-acoustic data and demonstrate how speech detection frequency can be used as one potential measure of human disturbance. We first generated multiple synthetic datasets using different data preprocessing techniques to train and validate deep neural network models. We evaluated the performance of our custom models against existing state-of-the-art VAD models using playback experiments with speech samples from a man, woman and child. Finally, we collected long-term data from a Norwegian forest heavily used for hiking to evaluate the ability of the models to detect human speech and quantify a proxy for human disturbance in a real monitoring scenario. In playback experiments, all models could detect human speech with high accuracy at distances where the speech was intelligible (up to 10 m). We showed that training models using location specific soundscapes in the data preprocessing step resulted in a slight improvement in model performance. Additionally, we found that the number of speech detections correlated with peak traffic hours (using bus timings) demonstrating how VAD can be used to derive a proxy for human disturbance with fine temporal resolution. Anonymizing audio data effectively using VAD models will allow eco-acoustic monitoring to continue to deliver invaluable ecological insight at scale, while minimizing the risk of data misuse. Furthermore, using speech detections as a proxy for human disturbance opens new opportunities for eco-acoustic monitoring to shed light on nuanced human-wildlife interactions.

AB  - The survival of Cryptosporidium parvum in source separated urine was investigated as part of a broader study on microbial risks associated with the reuse of human urine for sustainable agriculture. A dye permeability assay and in vitro excystation were the primary methods used to assess viability. In the collected urine most of the nitrogen is present as ammonia and the pH is generally around 9. Parallel investigations were made in buffers to compare possible toxic effects of urine to actual pH effects. Oocysts in the untreated urine were inactivated below the detection Limit (1/300) within 63 days. This inactivation rate was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in urine adjusted to pH 5 or 7 according to the dye permeability assay. The corresponding difference between different pH values was not seen in buffers, suggesting that the antiprotozoan effect of urine was mediated by other factors besides pH. The Swedish practice of storing urine for six months before its use thus appears satisfactory for the inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts.

AB  - Drainage of peatlands affects the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1), with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1). Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) to release of 4.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1). From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.

AB  - Semiaquatic flies (Diptera, Nematocera) are an ecologically important and species rich group of insects within the boreal and arctic biomes. Community structure, species richness and abundance of semiaquatic flies were studied in three habitat types (aapa mires, springs and headwater streams), totaling 19 study sites, within the subalpine ecoregion of northern boreal Finland. Concordance of semiaquatic fly species composition with plant assemblages (higher plants and mosses), and geographical and environmental distance matrices were also studied. The collected insect material consisted of 94 species and 9038 specimens. According to non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (visual inspection), multi-response permutation procedure and analysis of similarity tests, fly assemblages of aapa mires were clearly different from those of springs and headwater streams, but no differences were found between spring and headwater stream assemblages. The cumulative number of species was highest in headwater streams. Alpha diversity varied within the habitat types but was generally highest among headwater streams. Semiaquatic fly communities of headwater streams were the most abundant (number of specimens) and their rank-abundance distributions were relatively skewed; assemblages of aapa mires were less abundant and rather even. Community composition of combined plant material (219 taxa), higher plants (116 taxa) and mosses (103 taxa) were all in concordance with the flies; the strongest matrix correlation was found between higher plants and flies (Mantel test). The influence of geographical distance of the study sites to species composition was statistically significant but rather weak; instead, much stronger concordance was noted with environmental variables (Mantel test). Plants, especially higher plants, may be potential surrogates for semiaquatic fly assemblage composition. However, more studies of community concordance in a larger geographic area and within one habitat type are needed.

AB  - Microbial contamination of bovine raw milk often occurs at the farm. To acquire a deeper knowledge of the microbiota of farm tank milk, we studied milk from 45 farms situated in 2 geographical areas in Norway. Each farm was visited on 3 different occasions, with at least 2 wk between visits. We combined both bacterial cell counts and a sequence variant inference method of amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing to achieve a high-resolution overview of the microbiota in each sample. Compositional variation of the farm milk microbiota was shown in relation to the 2 areas, between the farms and between the sampling times. Despite the near constant level of bacteria enumerated in milk from each individual farm, the dominant microbiota differed significantly between the samplings. The predominant microbiota was dominated by spoilage genera, such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus, as well as the dairy fermentation genus Lactococcus and mastitis-causing organisms (Streptococcus). Analysis of the identified sequence variants within these genera showed that the populations of Pseudomonas and Lactococcus in milk had similar composition between the farms, but that Bacillus arid, in particular, Streptococcus populations changed between collection days from the same farm and between farms and geographical areas. Further-more, the levels and composition of Bacillus and Paeni-bacillus were different between the 2 geographical areas. The results presented here provide new insight into the farm milk microbiota and show that this microbiota is a dynamic community highly subject to variation.

AB  - This study examined the effects of key fishing tactics such as the choice of fishing gear and catch size, an indicator of swift and intense fishing, on the quality of landed fish. The effects of changes in yearly TACs, and thus catch shares, vessel size (length) and vessel age on fish quality were also investigated. A data set consisting of objective quality assessments of Atlantic cod in 432 catches from the coastal cod fishery in Norway, combined with details about the same catches was analyzed. The statistical analysis showed that fishing gear affected fish quality, but to a variable degree, with gillnets and Danish seines, the preferred methods in this fishery, providing the poorest-quality fish. It was also found that catch size had a negative impact on fish quality for gillnets, handlines, and Danish seines, but not for longlines. The results indicate that fishers' tactical decisions regarding what fishing gear to use, and how swiftly and intensely to fish, may lead to poor-quality fish being landed. Although this may be economically rational for fishers in a fishery with no restrictions on the choice of fishing gear and catch sizes, and where quality-based pricing is largely absent, it may lead to a substantial reduction in value-adding opportunities in downstream processing and marketing.

AB  - A common way of quantifying and communicating climate vulnerability is to calculate composite indices from indicators, visualizing these as maps. Inherent methodological uncertainties in vulnerability assessments, however, require greater attention. This study examines Swedish agricultural vulnerability to climate change, the aim being to review various indicator approaches for assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change and to evaluate differences in climate vulnerability depending on the weighting and summarizing methods. The reviewed methods are evaluated by being tested at the municipal level. Three weighting and summarizing methods, representative of climate vulnerability indices in general, are analysed. The results indicate that 34 of 36 method combinations differ significantly from each other. We argue that representing agricultural vulnerability in a single composite index might be insufficient to guide climate adaptation. We emphasize the need for further research into how to measure and visualize agricultural vulnerability and into how to communicate uncertainties in both data and methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The reduction of discards in European fisheries has been identified as a specific objective of the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the disposal of catch at sea, a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings can result in a reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur.

AB  - Purpose The green logistics literature remains undecided on how collaboration between shippers (i.e. logistics buyers) and logistics service providers (LSPs) may facilitate green logistics practices (GLPs). This paper identifies two types of collaboration mechanisms, relation specific and knowledge sharing, to systematically examine their influence on facilitating the different types of GLPs - as seen by shippers versus LSPs. Design/methodology/approach Survey responses of 169 shippers and 162 LSPs in Sweden were collected and analysed using exploratory- and confirmatory factor analysis, followed by multiple regression analysis. Findings The findings reveal that neither of the actors consistently favour a certain type of collaboration mechanisms for facilitating all types of GLPs. Although it was found that both actors share the same view on the role of collaboration mechanisms for some GLPs, their views took contrasting forms for others. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the green logistics literature by incorporating a trilateral distinction to present collaboration recommendations for GLPs, based on (1) the collaboration mechanism at play, (2) the actor's perspective and (3) the GLP in question. Practical implications Insights are offered to managers at shipper/LSP firms to apply the right ("fit for purpose") collaboration mechanisms in their relationships with their logistics partners with respect to the desired GLPs. Originality/value This is one of the first large-scale studies to systematically reveal in what way collaboration can facilitate the different types of GLPs.

AB  - This paper deals with the efficiency and sustainability of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) management in 30 Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) (the 28 European Union countries plus Norway and Iceland) for the period 2010-2016 using Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The first stage of the proposed methodology is EDA with already available (the CDW recovery rate) and suggested indicators (e.g., building stock characterization, dwelling occupancy ratio, macroeconomic ratios and CDW breakdown) to characterize the efficiency and sustainability of CDW management. The second stage is to assess the efficiency of countries using DEA through two original CDW production models, one for sustainability, measuring the efficiency of the construction sector for reducing its CDW, and the second a model to score the efficiency of maximizing the CDW recovery rate. The main outcome of the paper is the proposed methodology, which is a candidate for replacing current indicators in order to evaluate the performance of CDW policy, due to is adaptive nature, promoting the continuous improvement and overcoming the limitations of the poor quality of metrics, data and parametric indicators. The methodology has been experimentally validated using Eurostat data for 30 Member States of EEA, ranking them according to the two DEA model scores, to point out the countries considered efficient among those of their scale, as a reference for sustainable and efficient practices.

AB  - BackgroundA child's long-term illness or disability is always a serious matter that impacts the whole family. Costs related to an illness can substantially affect a family's financial situation. To date, there is little research on how parents experience available support for financial assistance. Surveys in Finland have found that families of children with long-term illnesses and disabilities could experience financial struggle and perceive the state provided financial support system as too complex. This article aimed to explore how caregivers of children with long-term illnesses perceived their financial situation, need for financial support and experienced its provision by the state in the Helsinki greater region.MethodsConvenience sampling was used. Participants were contacted through peer-support groups on Facebook. Eleven mothers of children with varying long-term illnesses and disabilities residing in the Helsinki greater region were interviewed using in-depth interviews. Recordings of the interviews were transcribed and analysed using framework analysis. An analytical framework was built to label the dataset, which was then charted. Lastly, themes were formed through descriptive analysis.ResultsThe main findings showed how the burden of caring for a child with a long-term illness or disability causes fatigue, which affects a family's financial situation holistically. This affected both employment and financial management, but also receiving information about and applying for the state provided allowances. Mental resources were further depleted by seeking information and applying for allowances. This contributed to a vicious cycle between parental fatigue and financial struggle. Participants found the allocation of funds inequitable across the country. Finally, participants thought the allowance was insufficient in compensating for time spent caring for their child's illness and did not consider their mental strain.ConclusionsEven in a welfare state such as Finland, caregivers of children with long-term illnesses are at risk of poverty and struggle with the organization of state provided financial support. Policies should be designed to ensure equity across the country and consider how the parental fatigue should be addressed. The study has implications for achieving sustainable development goals on wellbeing and reducing poverty.

AB  - While cities are moving towards environmentally friendly public transport such as electrification of public buses, the attractiveness of such innovative solutions among the bus users is yet to be explored. We study young people's perception of hybrid electric buses (HEBs) incorporating environmental performance in the bus service quality assessment framework. We collect data using a structured survey questionnaire from young people aged between 18 and 34 years, living in Southern Norway. Methodology-wise, we use the covariance-based structural equation model (SEM). As of contribution, we examine service quality of HEBs, using contextually modified measurement scales adopted from the SERVQUAL framework. We introduce a four-item perceived environmental performance construct in the context of HEBs. We find that tangible features of HEBs, bus service provider's empathy and perceived environmental performance of HEBs have a significant positive association with customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is positively associated with life satisfaction of young people. Finally, a post hoc analysis using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis reveals that the levels of young people's perceived service with bus drivers' quality, empathy of the bus service provider and customer satisfaction with HEBs are higher in colder temperature.

AB  - Mature forest ecosystems are the most considerable reservoir of organic carbon (OC) among terrestrial ecosystems. The effect of soil type on aboveground OC stocks and their annual increases (AI) of overstorey tree, understorey tree and ground vegetation layers in Estonian forest phytocoenoses with mature stands on mineral soils were studied. The study enfolds nine mineral soil groups, which are characterized by their phytocoenoses composition, soil cover properties and tree stands' taxation data. An assemblage of soil and plant cover or plant-soil system is the main focus point in explaining causal and quantitative sides of ecosystems functioning. Surface densities of OC stocks in aboveground phytomass of forests varied significantly in the range of 52-100 Mg OC ha(-1). High AI or productivity (4.8-5.5 Mg OC ha(-1) year(-1)) is a characteristic of forest ecosystems formed on leached, eluviated and pseudopodzolic soils. Forest ecosystem ground vegetation, which is an important ecological indicator, fulfils vacant ecological niches with herbs and/or mosses (up to 0.50 Mg OC ha(-1)). The variation of ecosystem OC stocks and their AI by soil type should be taken into account in regional OC stocks and its annual increase estimations.

AB  - Electrification of mobility can be an effective solution to reduce the environmental burden of the transportation sector. Previous research has frequently used theoretical assumptions and has not always adequately analysed spatiotemporal heterogeneity (charging location and timing) of the power generation in electric vehicle charging events. The environmental sustainability of electric vehicles has still considerable room for further improvement. This study aims to identify the time series greenhouse gas emission pattern of power generation and assess the potential emission reduction by altering the charging behaviour. The assessed environmental performance results of hourly power generation, using the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden as different power generation sources examples, draw several insights that could support the development of smart and more environmentally friendly charging. Among multiple identified spatiotemporal patterns, the greenhouse gas emissions (kg/MWh) during the weekend are significantly lower than working days for the Czech Republic (9 % lower) and Germany (19 % lower), while in Sweden being consistent throughout the week. A case study with four scenarios was conducted under different timings, routes (departure and destination), and real-world constraints. In general, under all the assessed scenarios, electric vehicles on the user phase have a lower greenhouse gas footprint than internal combustion engine vehicles. A greenhouse gas saving range from 3.6-32 %, compared to the baseline scenario (usual charging behaviour), could be achieved by changing the charging behaviour of the users from different assessed countries via targeting the time interval with lower greenhouse gas performance. This work has in view to facilitate electric vehicles development in reaching full potential contributions to sustainability.

AB  - Identifying the factors determining the abundance and distribution of species is a fundamental question in ecology. One key issue is how similar the factors determining species' distributions across spatial scales are (here we focus especially on spatial extents). If the factors are similar across extents, then the large scale distribution pattern of a species may provide information about its local habitat requirements, and vice versa. We assessed the relationships between landscape and national optima as well as landscape and continental optima for growing degree days, maximum temperature and minimum temperature for 96 bryophytes and 50 vascular plants. For this set of species, we derived landscape optima from abundance weighted temperature data using species inventories in central Sweden and a fine-grained temperature model (50 m), national optima from niche centroid modelling based on GBIF data from Sweden and the same fine-grained climate model, and continental optima using the same method as for the national optima but from GBIF data from Europe and Worldclim temperatures (c. 1000 m). The landscape optima of all species were positively correlated with national as well as continental optima for maximum temperature (r = 0.45 and 0.46, respectively), weakly so for growing degree days (r = 0.30 and r = 0.28), but sometimes absent for minimum temperature (r = 0.26 and r = 0.04). The regression slopes of national or continental optima on local optima did not differ between vascular plants and bryophytes for GDD and Tmax. However, the relationship between the optima of Tmin differed between groups, being positive in vascular plants but absent in bryophytes. Our results suggest that positive correlations between optima at different spatial scales are present for some climatic variables but not for others. Moreover, our results for vascular plants and bryophytes suggest that correlations might differ between organism groups and depend on the ecology of the focal organisms. This implies that it is not possible to routinely up- or downscale distribution patterns based on environmental correlations, since drivers of distribution patterns might differ across spatial extents.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the idea of a multisensory class room. The Multisensory Space is an easily modified space where landscapes (photographs and images), sounds and multisensory items create different cultural and learning environments for the visitors. The Space is the core of the Multisensory Space Method. The Method has been developed in Finland at Laurea University of Applied Sciences.
   This method can be applied when creating learning environments for different contexts, and it can be utilized in the activities of different organizations, such as learning institutions. Learning institutions can use the method for making their education more versatile and interactive.
   The Multisensory Space is created around a certain topic. The space is not supposed to be an exhibition but a place acts as an inspired learning environment. The process of creating and building the multisensory environments is an important learning process for the clients. Also, in the ready-made space, people gather together to encounter, interact and freely discuss.

AB  - The management of dredged sediments is a challenging issue since it involves the interconnection of complex economic, social, technical and environmental aspects. The EU LIFE SURE project aimed to apply a more sustainable dredging technique to Malmfjarden Bay in Kalmar/Sweden (a shallow urban water body with a high content of nutrients) and, additionally, it involved beneficial uses for the dredged material, in line with the circular economy concept. To achieve this, a life cycle assessment (LCA) study was carried out to assess the potential environmental impacts associated with two scenarios: sediment landfilling (S1) and soil conditioning (S2). This LCA study also aimed to evaluate and compare the costs related to each scenario. S1 contemplated the construction and operation of the landfill for 100 years, including the collection and discharge of leachate and biogas. S2 included the use of sediments in soils and the avoidance of producing and using fertilisers. Results showed that (S2) soil conditioning (total impact: -6.4 PE) was the scenario with fewer environmental impacts and the best economic evaluation. The S2 scenario was mainly related to the positive environmental savings produced by reducing fertiliser consumption (which also avoided purchase costs). However, S2 was also linked to potential negative effects associated with eutrophication and toxicity categories of impacts due to the possible spread of nutrients and pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic environments. In order to mitigate this problem, the sediments could be pre-treated to reduce their risk of pollution. Moreover, the main impact of the landfilling scenario (S1, total impact: 1.6 PE) was the emission of global warming-contributing gases during the operation of the facility. Implementing the soil conditioning scenario was therefore recommended, in line with the aim of the LIFE SURE project. Finally, it was recommended that LCA studies should be applied more often in the future when selecting beneficial uses for dredged sediments. The decision-making process is facilitated when the positive and negative impacts produced by each handling option are considered.

AB  - In line with the broader nationalist advances currently remaking the Western political landscape, the concept of integration has witnessed a marked rehabilitation. Whilst many influential critiques of the sociology of integration are already available, this article contests the concept's renewed purchase through addressing its own internal incoherence. Based on research in Stockholm, this critique concerns the relationship between ethnic identity and cultural integration. It will be argued that integration and the production of difference are intertwined, entangled dualities, and far from being a benign entanglement, this duality is premised on the force and reach of everyday civic racisms. Of pivotal and unique analytical significance here is the observation that racism should not only be considered an exogenous process that impedes integration, but as a multifaceted phenomenon folded into integration.

AB  - This paper presents a case study comparing sea and road transport modes for a Norwegian producer of plastic pipes for the construction industry. The study is based on three cases in which CO(2)e emissions and transport costs were calculated and compared. The main research problem was to analyze whether sea transport is more environmentally friendly than road transport in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and cost-effectiveness. The results from the three analyzed cases show that sea transport is not always the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective mode. We suggest that in order to evaluate the environmental impact and cost-effectiveness of sea transport as an alternative to road transport, such factors as transport distances, load weight/volume ratios, ship load factors, number of port calls, ship sizes, and ship fuel types for each specific case need to be analyzed.

AB  - The Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus lives at low-light depths, in muddy substrata of high organic content where water salinities are high and fluctuations in temperature are moderate. In this environment, the lobsters are naturally exposed to a number of potential stressors, many of them as a result of the surficial breakdown of organic material in the sediment. This process (early diagenesis) creates a heterogeneous environment with temporal and spatial fluctuations in a number of compounds such as oxygen, ammonia, metals, and hydrogen sulphide. In addition to this, there are anthropogenically generated stressors, such as human-induced climate change (resulting in elevated temperature and ocean acidification), pollution and fishing. The lobsters are thus exposed to several stressors, which are strongly linked to the habitat in which the animals live. Here, the capacity of Nephrops to deal with these stressors is summarised. Eutrophication-induced hypoxia and subsequent metal remobilisation from the sediment is a well-documented effect found in some wild Nephrops populations. Compared to many other crustacean species, Nephrops is well adapted to tolerate periods of hypoxia, but prolonged or severe hypoxia, beyond their tolerance level, is common in some areas. When the oxygen concentration in the environment decreases, the bioavailability of redox-sensitive metals such as manganese increases. Manganese is an essential metal, which, taken up in excess, has a toxic effect on several internal systems such as chemosensitivity, nerve transmission and immune defence. Since sediment contains high concentrations of metals in comparison to sea water, lobsters may accumulate both essential and non-essential metals. Different metals have different target tissues, though the hepatopancreas, in general, accumulates high concentrations of most metals. The future scenario of increasing anthropogenic influences on Nephrops habitats may have adverse effects on the fitness of the animals.

AB  - Natural forests are the essential component of the biosphere. Large green areas have a significant environmental impact and perform ecological and social functions. One of the most important reasons for the drying up of spruce forests in the Moscow Region is the mass reproduction of the bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Bark beetle is the cause of forest dieback, not only in Russia but also in the countries of northern Europe with the prevailing growth of spruce. In 2012, according to official data provided by the Moscow Region Government, only their bark beetles destroyed 34 thousand hectares of spruce plantations, at the beginning of 2014, about 70 thousand hectares. This article contains a study of the bark beetle's mass reproduction in the zone of mixed coniferous-broad-leafed forests within the territory of the Noginsky forestry. Studies were conducted using pheromone traps. The results of the study will allow us to understand the mechanism of the bark beetle's mass reproduction in the Moscow Region forests and to take effective sanitary and protection measures to preserve natural forests.

AB  - Electromobility options, especially electric vehicles (EVs) are more environmentally friendly, efficient and economical than conventional vehicles (CVs). There is a low market penetration of EVs and associated vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies in Australia compared to some European countries like Norway. Thus, transport planners and electrical grid policymakers need to investigate commuters' perceptions and behaviours related to EVs and V2G and the effects of incentives, as commuters will eventually switch from CVs to EVs. Our study investigated commuters' perceptions of and attitudes to V2G technology adoption at workplaces. The main findings are: 1) Commuters are willing to reduce their upfront costs when adopting EVs and associated V2G technologies. 2) Commuters want to reduce their daily transportation costs by using V2G technologies and care less about transport sustainability. 3) The greatest concerns of employers are that the cost of the V2G technology which could be too high and that its internal rate of return is unclear.

AB  - This paper contributes to research on restaurant work, which plays an important role in culinary arts research. The aim of this study was to make visible and elucidate the daily work practices in eight small restaurants in a seasonal tourist destination on the Southeast coast of Sweden. The central methods used were observations and participant observations and interviews, along with an e-mail questionnaire and examination of published information concerning all the restaurants. By means of practice theory, three central elements were used to identify and understand the configuration of the activities involved in daily work in small seasonal restaurants. These three elements, knowledge/competence, technologies/materiality and creation of meaning, formed four practices. The practices identified in this study were managing time and seasons; planning, strategising and controlling; knowing and having skills; and dreams and lifestyle. The conclusion of the study indicates that small restaurant practices may be conflicting, as they involve an extremely time-consuming workload, vague planning and lingering knowledge growth in contrast to the ideas of creativity and development that are a part of the restaurant owners' dreams and lifestyle.

AB  - Plant functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that characterizes the variability of functional traits within a community, landscape, or even large spatial scales. It can influence ecosystem processes and stability. Hence, it is important to understand how and why FD varies within and between ecosystems, along resources availability gradients and climate gradients, and across vegetation successional stages. Usually, FD is assessed through labor-intensive field measurements, while assessing FD from space may provide a way to monitor global FD changes in a consistent, time and resource efficient way. The potential of operational satellites for inferring FD, however, remains to be demonstrated. Here we studied the relationships between FD and spectral reflectance measurements taken by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite over 117 field plots located in 6 European countries, with 46 plots having in-situ sampled leaf traits and the other 71 using traits from the TRY database. These field plots represent major European forest types, from boreal forests in Finland to Mediterranean mixed forests in Spain. Based on in-situ data collected in 2013 we computed functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of FD, using foliar and whole-plant traits of known ecological significance. These included five foliar traits: leaf nitrogen concentration (N%), leaf carbon concentration (%C), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA). In addition they included three whole-plant traits: tree height (H), crown cross-sectional area (CCSA), and diameter-at-breast-height (DBH). We applied partial least squares regression using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance measured in 2015 as predictive variables to model in-situ FDis measurements. We predicted, in cross-validation, 55% of the variation in the observed FDis. We also showed that the rededge, near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of Sentinel-2 are more important than the visible region for predicting FDis. An initial 30-m resolution mapping of FDis revealed large local FDis variation within each forest type. The novelty of this study is the effective integration of spaceborne and in-situ measurements at a continental scale, and hence represents a key step towards achieving rapid global biodiversity monitoring schemes.

AB  - Adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology in AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry and organisations in past few years has already outgrown to the phase of implementation especially in building and other more or less large-scale projects all around the world. With BIM project teams can use 3D digital models to collaborate, have consistent and more accurate project data regardless how many times the design changes, or who changes it among engineers, architects or building and infrastructure owners. These projects should be sustainable, faster completed and more economical. The boost for implementation in Europe has begun in 2014 after the European Parliament made a decision to modernize European public procurement rules by recommending the use of electronic tools like BIM. The European Union Public Procurement Directive (EUPPD) set a goal for all the European Member States which may encourage or mandate the use of BIM for publicly funded design contests and building projects by 2016. European countries like Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom already require the use of BIM for publicly funded building projects. In this paper emphasis will be taken on adoption of BIM technology in linear construction projects like roads, highways, city streets and other urban area surfaces. There are projects in this sector which are already designed using BIM tools but its technology is not fully utilized in all aspects in 'life-time' of construction. Needed preconditions will be shown for everyday implementation from design and documentation to building and field support, on example of Croatia according to its current laws and regulations.

AB  - The sustainability of organic dairying in Canada, with respect to nutrients, remains unexamined. To assess how management affects nutrient status, we documented whole farm nutrient (NPK) budgets over 2 yr (2003 to 2005) and soil (0 to 15 cm) P and K status on 15 long-term Ontario organic dairy farms. Farm size, livestock density and herd productivity averaged 110 ha, 1.00 livestock units ha(-1) and 5656 kg milk cow(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Annual farm nutrient surpluses of 75 (N), 1 (P) and 11 (K) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) were lower than those reported for confinement-based dairy farms in the United States, pointing to possible environmental benefits from reduced off farm impacts on air and water quality. Weighted average soil test P levels were low (< 10 mg kg(-1)) on approximately 50% of farms, while exchangeable K levels were moderate to high (76 to 160 mg kg(-1)) on all farms. Four farms adopting a "self-sufficient" approach, producing most feed on-farm, imported little P as feed (1.37 to 1.90 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) and had negative aveage farm P balances (avg. -1.54 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)). An integrated nutrient management approach, along with a flexible feed import strategy, fosters the sustainability of organic dairying systems.

AB  - Knowledge of the insect communities inhabiting different types of dead wood, and their responses to variation in its availability, is important in assessing the potential ecological impacts of changes in the quality and quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD) that may result from forest management activities. We collected all Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera emerging from four decay classes of pine (Pinus strobus, P resinosa, P. banksiana) logs collected from 22 sites within Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada, in order to analyze variation in community composition and trophic structure as a function of log decay class, and to determine whether the abundance of wood-inhabiting insects in the logs was correlated with the amount of downed CWD in the surrounding area. Multivariate analyses revealed that community composition varied continuously across the four decay classes, and that our system of decay classes explained decomposition-related variation in insect communities relatively well compared to individual characteristics of the logs. Of 27 families that were classified as "common" (present in > 25% of the logs from at least one decay class), 19 were found to vary significantly in rank-abundance across decay classes, with nearly all of these favouring logs that were either in an early (class 1) or late (classes III-IV) stage of decomposition. These associations also reflected functional differences in trophic guild structure: xylophages and predators tended to be most abundant in fresh logs, whereas saprophages, fungivores, predators, and parasitoids tended to be most abundant in more highly decayed logs. When the community was considered as a whole, insect abundance generally did not appear to correlate with the volume of downed CWD in the surrounding 20 or 79 ha area, either within or across decay classes. When trophic guilds were considered separately though, we found that the average rank-abundance of fungivores was correlated with the surrounding volume of downed CWD. We conclude that wood-inhabiting insect biodiversity, and its associated ecological functions, may best be maintained through forest management practices that do not reduce overall amounts of CWD, and that ensure it is available in both early and late stages of decomposition.

AB  - Previous studies investigating density-dependent nest predation risk have suffered from unnaturally high nest densities (artificial nests) or lack of controls for nest predator densities (observational data on real nests). I designed an experiment with artificial nests within the natural range of nest densities using a Latin square design (to control for differences in densities of nest predators in time and space) to avoid the shortcomings of previous studies. I incorporated confounding factors, such as time in the breeding season and landscape type, in order to study whether they affected nest predation risk. The experiment was performed in dry semi-natural shrub-rich grasslands in Sweden, using artificial shrub-nests containing two quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs and a plasticine egg. Finally, I validated my results obtained from the artificial nest experiment by comparing relative nest predation risk on artificial nests with nest predation risk on real nests of red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio), a shrub-nesting passerine. Corvids were the major nest predators on artificial shrub nests as revealed by marks in plasticine eggs. Within the natural variation in densities of simultaneously active shrub nests, corvids increased their rates of predation with increasing densities of artificial nests, indicating a functional response. Nest predation risk decreased with time in the season and differed between grassland plots in farmland-dominated (high risk), farmland-forest mosaic (low risk), and forest-dominated (low risk) landscape surroundings. Furthermore, predation risk on artificial nests increased with decreasing distance to nests of at least one corvid species. Breeding red-backed shrikes selected grasslands with a low nest predation risk on artificial nests and reproductive success of shrikes was positively related to success of artificial nests. Moreover, the probability of success for both artificial and real red-backed shrike nests increased with increasing distance from the nearest corvid nest. Thus, results from the artificial nest experiment were validated by the results from the red-backed shrike population study. My results therefore suggest that predation risk measured on artificial nests can be used as a relative index of spatial and temporal variation in nest predation risk. My results also indicate that grasslands in forested landscapes should be given extra attention for conservation aspects, since nest predation risk is lower there compared to grasslands in more open habitats.

AB  - The global forest carbon (C) stock is estimated at 662 Gt of which 45% is in soil organic matter. Thus, comprehensive understanding of the effects of forest management practices on forest soil C stock and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes is needed for the development of effective forest-based climate change mitigation strategies. To improve this understanding, we synthesized peer-reviewed literature on forest management practices that can mitigate climate change by increasing soil C stocks and reducing GHG emissions. We further identified soil processes that affect soil GHG balance and discussed how models represent forest management effects on soil in GHG inventories and scenario analyses to address forest climate change mitigation potential.Forest management effects depend strongly on the specific practice and land type. Intensive timber harvesting with removal of harvest residues/stumps results in a reduction in soil C stock, while high stocking density and enhanced productivity by fertilization or dominance of coniferous species increase soil C stock. Nitrogen fertilization increases the soil C stock and N2O emissions while decreasing the CH4 sink. Peatland hydrology management is a major driver of the GHG emissions of the peatland forests, with lower water level corresponding to higher CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the global warming potential of all GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) together can be ten-fold higher after clear-cutting than in peatlands with standing trees.The climate change mitigation potential of forest soils, as estimated by modelling approaches, accounts for stand biomass driven effects and climate factors that affect the decomposition rate. A future challenge is to account for the effects of soil preparation and other management that affects soil processes by changing soil temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient balance, microbial community structure , processes, hydrology and soil oxygen concentration in the models. We recommend that soil monitoring and modelling focus on linking processes of soil C stabilization with the functioning of soil microbiota.

AB  - The EU "Fit for 55" legislative package provides for the introduction of regulations enabling the achievement of the emission reduction target by 55%. As part of the necessary actions, it is necessary to increase the energy efficiency of existing buildings. To achieve this, there are plans to increase the pace of the modernization of buildings, from 1% to 3% of buildings annually by 2030. However, this must be done with respect to the principles of sustainable development, circular economy and the conservation of buildings. This article presents a comprehensive comparison and calculation of carbon payback period (CPP) for selected insulation materials, combined with selected typical building partitions, and shows how quickly the payback period of greenhouse gases in the production of insulation materials is completed. Individual insulation materials (stone and glass wool, expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PUR) and cellulose) were analyzed in relation to different types of walls (seven types-including solid wall, diaphragm wall, large panel system (LPS), and concrete), in different locations (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Finland, Europe) and for various energy sources (electricity, gas, oil, biomass, district heating). After taking into account the carbon footprint embodied in the insulation materials, along with the potential reductions in the operational greenhouse gases emissions, the carbon payback period (CPP) was determined, resulting from the use of a given technology, insulation material and location. By comparing the CPPs for different insulations, this paper shows that the results vary significantly between EU countries, which have different embodied carbon factors for energy sources and materials, and that there is still a serious lack in the availability of reliable environmental information, which can limit research results.

AB  - Negative effects of a massive use of cars, such as congestion, air pollution, noise, and traffic injuries, are affecting the cities everywhere. Recently introduced shared vehicles, such as e-scooters and electric bicycles, could potentially accelerate the transition towards sustainable mobility. Although these vehicles are becoming increasingly common and accepted within regulatory frameworks, some local governments are not yet ready to integrate e-scooters into their transport systems. Indeed, the legislation is unclear as it is not easy to determine whether the e-scooter is more like a bicycle or a vehicle. Moreover, it is difficult to predict the impact of e-scooters on road traffic, as well as the type of road infrastructure chosen by e-scooter drivers or the possible interaction of such vehicles with weak road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists. This study showed an analysis of speed and behaviour of e-scooter drivers in the city of Trondheim (Norway) to investigate how to manage this mode of transport. A total of 204 e-scooters were observed on six different roads in the city centre. The speed of e-scooter drivers was measured by a speed tracker (average value 15.4 km/h) and their behaviour recorded by a hidden observer in the field. Gender, age, distance from pedestrians, speed adaptation to the environment, and type of vehicle used were registered for each e-scooter. Through a Binomial Logit analysis, the data obtained were used to analyse the type of road infrastructure preferred by e-scooter drivers. Results showed that the cycle path is more widely used with percentage value from 60% to 90% of users. In addition, the probability of choice depended mainly on the road environment. The aim of this analysis was to assist local authorities in regulating the safe use of e-scooters and developing appropriate policies for their integration into cities.

AB  - A bibliometric examination of sustainable development and travel agency research from 1997 to 2021 was used to uncover intellectual frameworks, developing trends, and future research prospects. CiteSpace was used to do a comprehensive search of 302 core articles from Web-of-Science and to analyze the results. The findings showed a normal growth in the amount of research, with major study topics. The articles with the most citations are mostly from the last 15 years. The USA has a solid leadership in publications, followed by Taiwan and Sweden. The network of authors shows a core structure on the margins where the European Commission and Bucharest University Economy Studies are ranked first. The discovery of structural flaws, the publication of critical papers, and the emergence of new emerging trends emphasize the priorities in the sustainable development and travel agency domains, pointing to new study prospects. This research is unique in that it performs a temporal and dynamic analysis of the last 24 years utilizing CiteSpace to analyze co-citation and co-occurrence networks.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that clusters can support the sustainable development of rural areas through the creation of shared value. This is done via the close exam-ination of six different cases of rural clusters in Greece, Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were taken from the clusters, which demonstrated that their main business approaches naturally coincided with the creation of economic, social, and environmental benefits for the local communities in which they operated. The case clusters were created in a top-down manner, aimed at boosting regional R&D activities and making the local economy more competitive and more sustainable. However, private initiative took over and al-lowed these clusters to flourish because meeting the regions' economic, social, and environmental needs successfully coincided with the target of the clusters' own development and profitability. The results show that clusters, with their potential for shared value creation, can constitute a powerful engine for the revitalisation and development of rural areas, addressing the significant challenges which they are currently facing.
